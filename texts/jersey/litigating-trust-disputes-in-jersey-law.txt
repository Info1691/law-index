FOREWORD

I am very pleased to have been asked to write a foreword for this publication. Although
the situation is slowly being rectified, there has been a disappointingly low number of text
books written on the law of Jersey in the last 100 years. One can understand perhaps that in
the time of Poingdestre and Le Geyt the law of Jersey was not being developed week in, week
out as it is now the case with a much larger Bar, four local judges and a Court of Appeal.
It is a real pleasure to see such a substantial work on an area of Jersey law and procedure
being published.
This is particularly so because of the importance of the trust industry on the Island of
Jersey, and, as a consequence, the importance of having a source of reference to the material
decisions of the courts and provisions of the statues. Trust law has travelled some distance
since its birth and development by the Courts of Equity in England and Wales several hundred years ago. Whereas once the trust was primarily a vehicle for family asset protection,
its use has now widened considerably - relevant still of course in those family circumstances, but also now relevant in a number of corporate and commercial arrangements,
which would not have been contemplated earlier. Overlying all these uses is the ability to
use the trust for fiscally advantageous purposes. The trust industry, for that is what it now
is, has become an important cornerstone of the financial services industry of the Island;
and because it makes itself a specialist offering for both private and commercial purposes,
the States of Jersey as the legislature and the Island courts (Royal Court, Court of Appeal
and Privy Council) have made an essential contribution to the development of trust law
internationally.
The Trust (Jersey) Law 1984 was ahead of its time in offshore jurisdictions, which hitherto had perhaps assumed that the trust law of England and Wales could arrive in each
jurisdiction by some sort of osmosis. Indeed, at the time the Rahmen senior proceedings
were issued in 1981, there were still some English counsel who questioned whether Jersey
had a trust law at all, and whether an additional ground of attack on a trust purporting to
be governed by the proper law of Jersey was that Jersey law did not recognise trusts. For
Jersey practitioners, such a view was clearly wrong, albeit that gifts into trust were gifts like
other gifts and were governed by the customary Jersey laws on donations. The late Advocate Keith Baker was one of those responsible for the framing of the 1984 Trust Law and
deserves much credit for it. The Law was deliberately designed to reflect the principles to be
found in the law of England and Wales, but at the same time to provide a flexible statutory
framework for development, and that is precisely what it has done. More recent amendments have arguably become more prescriptive, but nonetheless the success of the 1984 Law
can be measured by its imitation, as a common form of flattery, in other offshore jurisdictions since.
The continuing development of Jersey's identity is demonstrated both in political circles
and in the Law. In relation to trust law, an obvious illustration is the approach of the Royal

vi

Foreword

Court to applications to set aside a trust or a gift into trust for mistake, or to authorise
actions by trustees to be set aside on Hastings Bass principles. In these cases, the development of the law in Jersey has not followed quite the same path as it has in England and
Wales, although the approaches are arguably today more aligned than it would have been
the case some 4 or 5 years ago.
The fact is that the number of trusts that are either Jersey law trusts or are foreign law
trusts administered in Jersey is such that the Royal Court regularly exercises jurisdiction
over such trusts or their trustees. This has led to many judicial decisions in this area for
a small jurisdiction such as our own. It is fundamentally important for Jersey law and
cases to be brought together in a comprehensive way, and the extensive use of footnotes
in L
­ itigating Trust Disputes in Jersey makes it easy to check the source material for authenticating the summary that the book contains. I warmly congratulate Advocate Sheedy and
the ­Consulting Editor, Advocate Baker, on this very substantial piece of work, which adds
greatly to a bibliography of Jersey law.

Jersey as a Jurisdiction in which to
Litigate Trust Disputes
I. Introduction
The Bailiwick of Jersey is the largest part of all that now remains of the Duchy of ­Normandy.1
It first became a possession of the English Crown in 1066 following the Norman Conquest of England as a result of which the English and Norman possessions of William I
(the Conqueror) and Duke of Normandy became amalgamated and would remain so for
another 138 years. The portion of the Duchy on the continental mainland was annexed
by Philip Augustus into the Kingdom of France in 1204 (with Henry III relinquishing the
English Crown's claim to those territories in the Treaty of Paris of 1259).2 Jersey and the
other Channel Islands of neighbouring Guernsey, Sark, Herm, Jethou, Brecqhou, Alderney and the smaller surrounding islets were retained as possessions of the English Crown
but were jurisprudentially left to develop independently of Normandy; forming neither
part of mainland Normandy, the Kingdom of France nor the Kingdom of England.3 Jersey
has never been absorbed into the common law legal system of England and Wales and is
not part of the United Kingdom, having been a self-governing territory for over 800 years,
enjoying virtual total autonomy over its taxation, legal system and domestic affairs.4 Jersey
enjoys a special constitutional relationship with the British Crown (but not the British Parliament) which has persisted down the centuries to the present day.
Jersey is one of three Crown Dependencies that surround Great Britain, alongside the neighbouring Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. It is not part of the
United Kingdom's territory, nor is it accurately described as a colony or a United Kingdom
or British Overseas Territory.5 Jersey's formal constitutional relationship with the United

King Charles III of West Francia to Rollo, a leader of the Vikings, under the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte covering
the Cherbourg peninsular and land to the east in the northern-central coastal region of modern France.
2 The separation of the Channel Islands from mainland Normandy had occurred over 50 years prior in 1204.

Kingdom is described as a possession of the British Crown.6 Acts of the Parliament of the
United Kingdom do not apply to Jersey unless the Act expressly applies to Jersey or applies to
Jersey by necessary implication and only then with the agreement of the Insular Authorities
by the legislation being transmitted and registered by Jersey's unicameral parliament known
as the States Assembly by an Order in Council. By long-established constitutional convention the United Kingdom Parliament does not seek to legislate for the island to the extent
that the convention has long since crystallised into a principle of Jersey's constitutional law.
Neither do the decisions of British courts (other than the Privy Council, but only when sitting as a final court of appeal from Jersey) have any formal binding legal effect within Jersey.

Jersey is not recognised as a state for the purposes of international law. Jersey is not a part
of European Union and is not subject to EU law, save to a limited extent not relevant to
this text, described in Protocol 3 of The Treaty of Rome.7 Formally, the United Kingdom
is responsible for Jersey's international relations and the British Crown signs international
treaties on its behalf.8 For an international treaty to apply to Jersey, the Bailiwick must be
mentioned expressly either in the treaty or in an instrument of ratification if it is to extend
to it. The government of the United Kingdom has a long established practice that when
the UK ratifies a treaty, it does so on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and such (if any) of the Crown Dependencies and UK overseas territories
as wish the treaty to apply to them. There is settled constitutional practice that the government of the United Kingdom will consult the States of Jersey before agreeing the territorial
application of its international agreements. Further, Jersey operates a dualist system in relation to the impact of international treaties and conventions such that while a treaty may
notionally apply to Jersey, the treaty will not become part of the island's domestic law unless
and until the States legislates to achieve this effect.9

II. Jersey's Legal System
1-4

Jersey's legal system has its roots in Norman customary law but has also been influenced in
varying degrees over the centuries by English law and French law.10 Jersey is a customary,

available at: www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/moj/our-responsibilities/Background_Briefing_on_the_Crown_

of first the English and subsequently British Crown, better reflecting the island's particular loyalty to the person of
the Sovereign.

rather than a common law, jurisdiction.11 The distinction results from a different conceptual foundation to the basis upon which rules of law are considered binding. The pronouncements of judges in common law systems are binding because they are handed down
by judges, whose authority to make them is recognised by the constitution as a legitimate
source of lawmaking. Jersey's rules of law derive their legitimacy from long usage and settled acceptance of a practice rather than because the Royal Court states them as a rule of
law.12 Long usage can cause a particular practice to effectively crystallise into a rule of law if
it is repeatedly accepted by the Royal Court as the way people conduct their affairs. Where
there is doubt or disagreement as to a particular practice the Court will look for factual
evidence of usage in its determination.13
There is little customary law based either upon the Ancienne Coutume de Normandie or the
later 1583 'official redaction' of Norman customary law by the then French king Charles
VII, known as the Coutume Reformee that is relevant to Jersey's law of trusts14 although
some elements of the litigation process do have their roots in the island's customary law.15
Trusts first appeared with any degree of regularity in Jersey's jurisprudence during the nineteenth century.16 Today, Jersey's law of trusts is governed principally by the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984, as amended. While the Royal Court may look to the Ancien Régime of France,
particularly the Coutume de Normandie in some areas of its law, it will generally look to
England and Wales and the other leading common law jurisdictions, both onshore and
offshore, for guidance on matters pertaining to trust law in the absence of any relevant local
decision.17 Although some areas of Jersey's commercial law, such as the law of contract, are
much influenced by Norman and Ancien Norman law principles, it is not a heresy to draw
upon English and Commonwealth jurisprudence in these fields which may be regarded as
useful and persuasive authority if they can be reconciled with those principles. However,

11 Snell v Beable [2001] 2 UKPC 304 at [17]: 'the word custom may be used in a variety of senses in the legal
context. Broadly speaking, custom may be said to be the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no
formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community'. This
was contrasted with the notion of a coutume as follows: 'as the different systems of French customary law became
codified by Royal Authority they acquired the status of coutumes. The means that they had official status, so that
nothing that they contained could be abrogated except by statute'; at [18].

can be raised by a person in possession of land in order to restrain a wrong which disturbs him in that possession

16 The Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Civil, Municipal and Ecclesiastical Laws of
the Island of Jersey, together with Minutes of Evidence (1861) stated that the creation of trusts by an act between
living persons was not expressly forbidden, but trusts of private individuals, unconnected with public objects, were
'absolutely unknown' (Report, at XXV). See also Godfray v Godfray (1865) 3 Moo PC NS 316 (a decision of the
Privy Council) and Perrot v Breton (1891) 11 CR 29 (a decision of Royal Court sitting in the Superior Number).
17 The Estate of Father Amy [2000 JLR 80] at [93]: 'The court therefore has a choice. In the absence of local
authority, it must look for guidance elsewhere […] the court's sole duty is to declare the law of Jersey and it must
do so for the community of the 21st century. To insist on adopting some rule laid down or derived from principles
laid down several centuries ago, if they are clearly inappropriate for modern times, would in my judgment be an
unsatisfactory way of proceeding and is not required by authority'.

Litigating in Jersey

the better, modern, view is that in matters of contract, Jersey law starts from the principles
set out in the French customary law texts and the later writings of Poingdestre and Le
Geyt.18 In trust matters Jersey will often look to judgments of English and Commonwealth
courts as being persuasive, particularly in the absence of any Jersey authority.19 Local legislation is enacted by the States Assembly.20 The sources of law in Jersey are in both French
and English (although since the 1950s the permissive working language of the Royal Court
and legal system has been English).21

A. Jersey's Legal Profession
1-6

Jersey's legal profession is composed of advocates and solicitors (sometimes referred to
'members of the Chambre des Écrivains'), only the former having rights of audience before
the island's courts. There is no tradition of an independent bar along the lines of the English chambers model in Jersey, with the vast majority of advocates practising as members
of firms.22 While the Royal Court does recognise litigants to appear in person before it,23 in
order to bring or defend proceedings that have any international flavour before the Royal
Court it is usually necessary to instruct a Jersey advocate.24 Legal practitioners qualified to
exercise rights of audience before courts in jurisdictions outside Jersey, however senior, currently have no rights of audience to appear before the Bar in the island's courts.

B. Precedent in Jersey
1-7

Owing to the customary rather than common law foundations to its law, Jersey law does
not strictly adhere to the principle of stare decisis as understood by courts in common law
jurisdictions, under which courts follow statements of legal principles laid down in earlier
cases decided on similar facts and issues.
The peculiar feature of the English doctrine of precedent is its strongly coercive nature. English
judges are sometimes obliged to follow a previous case although they have what would otherwise
be good reasons for not doing so. In other words, a precedent may be binding and not merely persuasive in England because stare decisis is, generally speaking, a hard-and-fast rule in this country.
It is a great deal more than a mere maxim of judicial conduct to be followed if other things are
more or less equal….This rigid adherence to the principal of stare decisis on the part of the English
judges is rendered all the more significant by the vast scope of case-law in England. Some branches
of our law are almost entirely the product of the decisions of the judges whose reasoned judgments
have been reported in various types of law reports for close on 700 years. Other branches of our

24 RCR 2004, r 4/2(2) requires a plaintiff to give an address for service within Jersey, which is a practical impossibility where the plaintiff is not a Jersey resident and no advocate is instructed. A similar rule applies in respect of
defendants/respondents under RCR 2004, r 6/6(2).

law are based on statutes, but, in many instances, case-law has played an important part in the
interpretation of those statutes.25

In contrast to adherence to the principle of stare decisis, the position in Jersey was described
as follows:

1-8

Although the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is our ultimate court of appeal, Jersey is not,
and never has been a colony to which the corpus of English law has been exported. The original
source of Jersey law was the Très Ancien Coûtumier followed by the Grand Coûtumier of Normandy.
In 1861 the Royal Commissioners appointed to enquire into the Civil, Municipal and Ecclesiastical
Laws of the Island recorded (Report, Pt. I, at iii) that-
'from a very early period … [Jersey has] … retained [its] ancient Norman Law, except so far as it
has in the course of time been modified or corrupted by subsequent enactments or usages. It was
indeed contended before us, that the common law of England has been introduced into Jersey. We
do not see any proof of this…'
Since 1861 the influence of English law in some areas has been more pervasive, but we do not
consider that this influence has changed the fundamental jurisprudence (in the English sense) of
the Island.26

The practical position is that while the Royal Court is not bound by any rule to do so, it
usually follows its own decisions unless it considers a prior authority to have been wrongly
decided or to follow it would give rise to a practical injustice.27 The Jersey Court of Appeal
is not bound by the decisions of the Royal Court although the Royal Court is bound by
the Jersey Court of Appeal and Judicial Committee Privy Council on appeal from Jersey
(only), unless such earlier decision has been invalidated by subsequent legislation or some
compelling change in circumstances.28 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council provides the final tier of domestic appeal, with leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal being
required.29 As a general rule, the Privy Council will not grant leave to appeal except on questions of great or general public importance or the appeal raises serious issues of personal
status or involves property of considerable value.30 Decisions of the UK Supreme Court,
formerly the House of Lords, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in appeals from other jurisdictions are at most only persuasive in Jersey, the degree of persuasiveness depending upon a number of considerations
including the similarity between the law of Jersey and that other jurisdiction.31

Litigating in Jersey

England's dualist approach to law and equity in the Court of Chancery, is doctrinally uncertain. The modern English law concept of the trust or use, that began to be enforced by the
Court of Chancery in the early fifteenth century was founded upon the Lord High Chancellor's equitable jurisdiction to prevail against the conscience of the owner of property as
viewed through the eyes of the common law. Not infrequently the property the subject of
the use, was land. It remains a feature of Jersey law that a trust of immovables, ie land within
Jersey, is a legal impossibility32 and so the development of the trust in Jersey, has, necessarily, come into being via another route than that developed in England and Wales.
Not all the principles that were developed by the English Court of Chancery, and since
developed by the Chancery Division, Court of Appeal and House of Lords (now Supreme
Court) have permeated into Jersey's law.33 A consequence of this has been a number of
instances in which the Royal Court has chosen to 'go its own way' in developing trust law
in Jersey, free from what it regards to be the constraints of the rules of English precedent
or what it otherwise perceives as unnecessary historical baggage.34 It cannot therefore be
assumed that the Royal Court's equitable jurisdiction is an exact mirror of England's.
While in practice Jersey is a jurisdiction that recognises and gives effect to equitable concepts and remedies, the precise nature of the Royal Court's equitable jurisdiction has not
been definitively settled. There are a number of cases in the annals of the Royal Court that
appear to equate 'equity' as being closer to the French law concept of 'equité' (literally translated as justice, sometimes as fairness or even the benevolent construction of a statute) than
the 'equity' as a term of art as developed by the English Chancellors.35
The Royal Court is a Court of equity in the widest sense is clear…But that does not mean that the
Royal Court has any wider powers than the former Chancellors of the Court of Chancery…More­
over, the conditions in the English Courts which gave rise to the system of law known as equity were
not mirrored in the history of the Royal Court. It may well be that 'equity' in Jersey inclines more
to the French 'equité' than its English counterpart…although as I have said, the Royal Court has
declared itself a Court of Equity, that does not mean to say that all the principles developed in the
English Court of Chancery must necessarily apply. The more so is this the case when that Court is
interpreting a number of English statutes and cases based on English Trust Law. Nevertheless, the
Royal Court gives relief to someone who is threatened with a wrong which is, of course, an equitable remedy. As the Court said in Sayers v Briggs (1964 J.J. 399, at 401):
'The Court also believes that it has inherent power to prevent a wrong from being committed
before it is done'.36

32

Now codified in the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 11(2)(a)(iii).

33 In some notable instances, Jersey has legislated to abolish certain principles of trust law that persist in ­England

eg Art 15(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (abolishing the rules of perpetuity and excessive accumulation).

'the appropriate way for the courts of this jurisdiction to address the subject is, we suggest, not by reference to
any pre-conceptions of what is or is not conceptually possible or arguably supported by English authority, but,
once again, as a matter of evidence'. Jersey has enacted a legislative equivalent to the jurisdiction formerly existing
in English common law known as 'the Rule in Re Hastings Bass'; see Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 47B-7J; cf Pitt

D. The Royal Court of Jersey
The Royal Court is Jersey's principal, superior court of record. It has original and unlimited
jurisdiction37 over both civil and criminal matters and is a creature of the island's customary
law, tracing its existence back to the thirteenth century. It is equivalent to the High Court of
Justice in England and Wales and most Commonwealth jurisdictions or the Court of Session
in Scotland. The Royal Court has four divisions: the Héritage, Probate, Family and Samedi
Divisions38-dealing with land, succession, family disputes and all other matters respectively.
Trust disputes are generally commenced and determined in the Samedi Division although
trust disputes may arise in the context of matrimonial litigation commenced in the Family Division or under a will, administered in the Probate Division. In practice, other than
the Family Division and Probate Division which have their own procedural rules,39 in civil
causes the composition of the Royal Court in each division is the same. Each division of the
Royal Court has power to transfer proceedings between its divisions.40
The Royal Court sits either in the Inferior or Superior Number.41 The Inferior Number is
comprised of the Bailiff and at least two Jurats. The Superior Number (which very rarely
sits in relation to civil disputes save as a rule-making body, but more frequently in criminal
matters as a sentencing court) is comprised of the Bailiff and no less than five Jurats.42 'The
Court', as defined in the Royal Court Rules 2004, means any division of the Royal Court
sitting in the Inferior Number, the Bailiff (including the Deputy Bailiff or a Commissioner
sitting alone) or the Judicial Greffier sitting alone, as Master of the Royal Court, without
Jurats.43 Decisions of the Inferior Number can be appealed, if from the Greffier to the Royal
Court sitting in the Inferior Number or, if from the Inferior Number to the Jersey Court
of Appeal,44 with the Bailiwick's ultimate appellate court being the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in London. The principal judges of the Royal Court are the Jurats and the
Bailiff. The executive functions of the Royal Court are performed by the Viscount and the
Judicial Greffier, both of whom also exercise some judicial functions, as described below.

E. The Bailiff
The Royal Court is presided over by the Bailiff, who is the island's Chief Justice and president of and ex officio member of the Jersey Court of Appeal. The office of Bailiff is an

Court as part of its inherent jurisdiction to regulate proceedings conducted before it.

ancient one that carries a number of significant extra-judicial functions including president
(speaker) of the States Assembly (the island's unicameral parliament), 'civic head' of the
island and Deputy Governor in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor.45 The office of
Bailiff may be executed by the Deputy Bailiff.46 To facilitate the caseload of the Royal Court
the Bailiff has power to appoint any number of Commissioners; part-time judges, to sit
and execute the office of Bailiff when either the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff is unavailable.47
Commissioners are often appointed to deal with particularly long cases where owing to
the Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff 's other commitments on their time, or for other reasons such
as a conflict, it is otherwise inappropriate for the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff to sit. The judicial functions of the Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and each of the Commissioners are identical.48
Where reference is made to the Bailiff in this text, it is a reference to any of those capable
of exercising the Bailiff 's judicial functions. The Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff remain the only
de jure permanent trial judges in the island although it has been the practice to appoint at
least one Commissioner as a de facto third permanent presiding judge to handle the Royal
Court's burgeoning caseload.49 The Royal Court also has a permanent judge to deal with
interlocutory matters in civil cases only: the Master of the Royal Court.50

F. The Jurats
1-16

The office of Jurat in Jersey51 is documented from the early years of the thirteenth century
in a document known as the 'Constitutions of King John', issued in 1204 in which King John
decreed that the Island should elect 'duodecim optimatos juratos'-'their twelve best sworn
men to keep the pleas'. There are only 12 Jurats in office at any one time. The Bailiff and
two Jurats constitute the Inferior Number of the Royal Court.52 The Inferior Number tries
all contested civil actions.53 The respective functions of the Bailiff and the Jurats are set out
Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948.54 The Bailiff may sit alone to determine questions of law

45

See Lord Carswell, 'Report into Review of the Crown Officers' (6 December 2010).

46 A post created by the Deputy Bailiff (Appointment and Function) Law 1958, the Deputy Bailiff is also an ex

officio member of the Jersey Court of Appeal.
47 The powers of a Commissioner are the same as those exercisable by the Bailiff sitting in the Inferior Number;
see Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948, Art 12.
48 Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948, Art 12(1).
49 Reference is sometimes seen in the older cases to a Lieutenant Bailiff, an office to which the Bailiff may
appoint an individual under his customary law powers. Since the introduction of the office of Deputy Bailiff in
1958 to permanently share the Bailiff 's workload and deputise for him as necessary, the role of the Lieutenant
Bailiff in Jersey as a trial judge has diminished. However, the office still exists and is generally today an honorary
position held by the most senior serving Jurat. The Lieutenant Bailiff may preside over the Royal Court as required
by the Bailiff but not being legally trained, their role being confined to non-contentious business, such as the passing of contracts for the sale of land before the Court.
50 See Judicial Greffier below.
51 The office of Jurat is not peculiar to Jersey but is widely known in continental Europe.
52 Loi (1862) sur la procédure devant la Cour Royale, Art 2. Where the matter is for determination by the Bailiff
alone, the Inferior Number can also be properly constituted by the Bailiff alone; see RCR 2004, r 3/6.
53 Any reference to 'the Court' in the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 means the Inferior Number (ie the Master has no
jurisdiction to determine any question for the Court under that statute).

and procedure and has power to award costs, including awarding security for costs.55 Matters of law include the admissibility of evidence and the determination of ancillary facts in
relation to admissibility.56 The Bailiff enjoys a limited jurisdiction to make findings of facts
when they are intertwined with predominantly issues of law where this has been so certified
by the Judicial Greffier, with whose assessment the Bailiff agrees.57 In all other matters falling outside of these limited exceptions, the Jurats are the sole tribunal of fact (in accordance
with the Bailiff 's directions on questions of law and procedure) and determine the quantum of any pecuniary award sought in proceedings. An exercise of discretion by the Royal
Court, ie what decision should follow from the primary facts, is generally a ­collegiate matter
for the Bailiff and Jurats58 unless the Bailiff is otherwise authorised to reach a decision, for
example if the matter is one of procedure and therefore deemed to be an issue of law. In all
causes and matters, the Bailiff has a casting vote should the Jurats be unable to agree as to
their decision on the facts.59

G. The Viscount
The Viscount is the executive or enforcement officer of the Royal Court and is supported in
the execution of her60 duties by a Deputy Viscount and Viscount Substitutes (any of whom
may execute the office of Viscount) and an administrative department, the Département du
Vicomte.61 Over the centuries the Viscount has accumulated a number of disparate functions of which the most relevant for the purposes of this text are:
1.

to effect personal service of documents and process in civil proceedings within the
island;62
the execution and enforcement of Acts of the Royal Court within the island;

the collection and enforcement of fines; and
as the conduit for the service of foreign civil proceedings on those within the island.

the Viscount upon the making of a declaration of désastre.65 The Viscount is not therefore
just a court officer but also has the potential to become an active participant in litigation
where an insolvent person is a party to litigation. The Viscount also serves as curator of
last resort for impecunious incapacitated persons and may represent them in proceedings
before the Royal Court.

H. The Judicial Greffier
1-19

1-20

The Judicial Greffier is the chief administrative officer (ie the clerk) of the Royal Court and
Court of Appeal. The Greffier is supported by a department known as the Judicial Greffe
the function of which, in some respects, is shared with the Département du Vicomte is as
a de facto court service for the island.66 The powers and functions of the Judicial Greffier
do not have to be exercised personally but may be exercised by any sworn member of the
Judicial Greffe including the Deputy Judicial Greffier, the Assistant Judicial Greffier or any
Greffier Substitute.67 The Master of the Royal Court (referred to in schedule 3 to the Royal
Court Rules 2004) is in fact a Greffier Substitute before whom the vast majority of interlocutory applications are determined.
Like the Viscount, the Judicial Greffier has become a repository of a number of different
functions.68 The services provided in support of the Samedi Division of the Royal Court
that are relevant for the purposes of this text are:69
1.

the listing of actions pending before the Royal Court;
the determination of interlocutory summonses in pending actions;70
the taxation of costs ordered in proceedings before the Royal Court;
the registration of foreign judgments (including Foreign Maintenance Orders) that are
sought to be recognised or enforced in Jersey;71 and
the holding of monies paid into court.

The Judicial Greffier sitting as Master of the Royal Court, alone without Jurats, can constitute the Royal Court and may therefore exercise the jurisdiction of the Royal Court
when sitting in the Inferior Number save where a statute or Schedule 1 to the RCR 2004
expressly excludes that jurisdiction.72 Accordingly, the Greffier has power to grant leave

jurisdiction. This is effectively a delegation of jurisdiction by the Inferior Number. That delegation is significant in
relation to appeals of orders of the Greffier, which are made to the Inferior Number. While the case law on the precise nature of that appeal is unsatisfactory, it is tolerably clear that the Inferior Number reserves to itself the right
to hear the argument before the Greffier de novo, subject to it having 'close regard' to the decision of the Greffier
(who is recognised as having a particular expertise in respect of interlocutory matters). See also n 53.

to serve proceedings out of the jurisdictions, grant applications for summary judgment,
strike out pleadings, order further and better particulars, grant leave to amend pleadings,
grant security for costs, extend or abridge time limits and give directions for the progress
of proceedings.73 The Greffier's jurisdiction is not limited to hearing and determining noncontentious matters.74 While the Inferior Number is able to hear interlocutory summonses,
as a matter of practice, the vast majority are heard before the Greffier, provided jurisdiction
exists notwithstanding the concurrent jurisdiction.75 The Judicial Greffe also houses the
island's probate, intellectual property and land registries.

I. The Law Officers
Her Majesty's Attorney General for Jersey and Her Majesty's Solicitor General for Jersey,
comprise the principal officers of the Law Officers' Department. While the bulk of the Law
Officer's duties are concerned with the States' legal business and criminal proceedings on
the island and as a conduit with the Royal Court and other jurisdictions for rendering
international mutual legal assistance, the Attorney General has an important role in litigation before the Royal Court concerning charities.76 Nowhere in the island's statute books
are the powers of the Attorney General in relation to charities codified.77 The Charities
(Jersey) Law 2014, which for the first time creates a charities commissioner to oversee the
application of a new test to entities sought to be registered as charities in Jersey,78 expressly
provides that it does not derogate from any power or function of the Attorney General that
existed independently of the 2014 Law (under customary law or otherwise), in respect of
Jersey charities or of acts for charitable purposes.79 The Attorney General therefore retains
all the historical duties and powers of his office as representative of the Crown that require
or enable him to act in the public interest in relation to charities. Additionally, he has had
various powers and standing to participate in proceedings under the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984.80

J. Jersey's Rules of Civil Procedure-General Points
1-23

1-24

1-25

Jersey's civil procedure shares a number of common features with that of England and
Wales and other common law jurisdictions. Despite Jersey's historical and geographical
proximity to France, the Royal Court adopts an adversarial, rather than an inquisitorial
approach to its civil proceedings.81 Jersey's rules of pleading, summary disposal, evidence
and trial process will be familiar to civil practitioners familiar with the common law tradition and it is not proposed to dwell at length on these aspects of Jersey's civil procedure.
Litigation before Jersey's Royal Court is regulated by a set of procedural rules; the Royal
Court Rules 2004 (as amended) ('RCR'). The Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948, states that
rules of court may be made by the Superior Number,82 with the advice and assistance of
the Royal Court Rules Committee, for regulating and prescribing the procedure and practice to be followed in the Royal Court.83 Rules, and the supporting practice directions, are
amended or revoked from time to time by subsequent rules and are laid before the States
as soon as may be after they are made, who may resolve that they be annulled. The Royal
Court Rules 2004 constitute an enactment for the purposes of Article 1 of the Interpretation (Jersey) Law 1954 which must be read, so far as is possible, so as to be compatible
with the European Convention of Human Rights.84 The Royal Court (General) Rules were
first introduced in 1963. These rules are accredited to the work of F de Lisle Bois, the then
Deputy Bailiff. Since 1963 the Rules have been significantly amended or replaced on a number of occasions, most notably in the form of the Royal Court Rules 1968, the Royal Court
Rules 1992 and the Royal Court Rules 2004 (as amended), the current version. Together,
the Royal Court Rules 2004 and accompanying practice directions are considerably shorter
than the equivalent procedural rules prevailing in England and Wales. There is currently
no Jersey equivalent of the White Book, comprising a consolidated set of rules and body of
commentary and guidance for practitioners. That dearth of guidance can make the rules,
when read in isolation, appear somewhat Spartan, with a number of apparent gaps in the
practice of the Court.85 In large measure those apparent gaps are filled by a combination
of established practice and experience of the island's legal profession, case law and in some
instances ad hoc assistance from the Court itself.
The Royal Court Rules 2004 are not the only source of rules for proceedings before the
Royal Court with discrete procedural regimes governing discrete corners of the Royal
Court's jurisdiction.86 However, for the purposes of this text, the RCR 2004 are in large

81 With one possible exception, in relation to trust proceedings, being its supervisory jurisdiction in relation to
trusts in which the court may and does adopt a more, albeit informally, inquisitorial approach.

84 Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 4.

86 Other rules that apply are the Matrimonial Causes Rules 2005 (previously the Matrimonial Causes (General)
(Jersey) Rules 1979) pursuant to Art 43 of the Matrimonial Causes (Jersey) Law 1949, the Children Rules 2005,
the Bankruptcy (Désastre) Rules 2006 (formerly 1991) and certain other procedural codes which apply by virtue
of various other enactments including, by way of example only, the Code of 1771 and Loi (1835) sur la procédure
devant la Cour Royale.

part the rules with which practitioners need concern themselves. As will be appreciated
from looking at the RCR 2004, some provisions are outside the scope of this text.87 Further
procedural rules relevant to trust litigation have been made pursuant to the power in Article
13, including the Service of Process (Jersey) Rules 1994;88 and the Judgments (Reciprocal
Enforcement) Rules 1961.89
The former Rules of the Supreme Court as they stood at 1999, before the coming into
force of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, are still sometimes consulted by Jersey practitioners given the similarity (and in some cases near identical wording) between certain parts of
those rules and Jersey's own rules.90 However, as 1999 recedes further from memory, reference to the RSC in interpreting the equivalent provisions in the RCR must be regarded with
increased caution. Jersey's procedure rules are not to be treated as being frozen in aspic at
the date the RSC were abandoned in England and Wales and there have been developments
both in terms of rules and practice on both sides of the Channel in the intervening years
which must be taken into account. Jersey's ancien customary law is now rarely of everyday
practical application to civil procedure in trust litigation. That said, the Court has been
known on some occasions to consult the writers or commentators on Jersey and Norman
customary law on matters of substantive law and practice.91 Jersey's Court of Appeal, unlike
the Royal Court, is a creature of statute.92 The Court of Appeal has its own procedural rules,
separate from the Royal Court Rules 2004.93

1-26

III. Commencing Proceedings in Jersey
Civil proceedings before the Royal Court are commenced in one of three ways; by simple
summons, by Order of Justice94 or by way of Representation. The RCR 2004 contain very
little guidance on the form or contents of any of these forms of originating process and provide little practical assistance as to whether a summons, Order of Justice or Representation
is the appropriate form of originating process for a particular given dispute.

A. Orders of Justice
1-28

1-29

1-30

An Order of Justice has a combined function as both a form of originating process and a
pleading, the Jersey equivalent to the particulars of claim in English civil procedure. An
Order of Justice is required to be signed by the plaintiff 's advocate and where the Order
of Justice contains injunctive relief, must be signed by the Bailiff.95 The vast majority of
disputes alleging a breach of trust or other duty owed by trustees are commenced by way of
Order of Justice. In cases where an injunction has been sought and obtained ex parte, until
the return date confirming or discharging the injunction, the Order of Justice also serves as
the Court's order.
Other than one notable exception in relation to injunctions, the RCR contain no rules
or guidance that certain types of proceedings must or should to be commenced using an
Order of Justice. In practice, the customary rule as to whether an Order of Justice is the
appropriate form of originating process is whether the matter in dispute can be pleaded as
a cause of action, properly so called, ie the vindication of a the plaintiff 's substantive rights.
Many forms of relief that are capable of being granted by the Royal Court, in answer to a
trust dispute before it, arise from the Royal Court's inherent discretionary jurisdiction to
intervene in and supervise the administration of trusts, and, as such, is not easily analysed
as a cause of action properly so called and is more appropriately commenced by way of
Representation.
An Order of Justice is usually the appropriate form of originating process for the following
types of proceedings before the Royal Court involving trusts:

claims for breach of trust or breach of other duty owed by a trustee;96

claims for an account against a trustee;
claims for an account from a third party as if a constructive trustee in respect of knowing receipt or dishonest assistance;
claims brought by or against the trustee by or against a third party to the trust;97
claims for injunctive relief (including orders under the Royal Court's Mareva and
Anton Piller jurisdictions) by or against a trustee;
claims for an arrêt or saisie by or against a trustee;
claims for pre-action disclosure under the Court's Norwich Pharmacal and Bankers
Trust98 jurisdiction;

95 ibid, r 20/5(1). Where the plaintiff is a litigant in person, the Bailiff may sign the Order of Justice before it can
be served; see In re Syvret [2014 (1) JLR 71].
96 A claim in respect of breach of trust is not rendered a claim for a liquidated debt or sum, and therefore capable of being commenced by summons, merely because a sum is specified in the prayer for relief. Claims for breach
of trust should be commenced by way of Order of Justice'; see Mocha Investments Limited v Crills [1990 JLR N-10].

happens to be a trustee.

i. Commencement of Proceedings by way of Order of Justice
Where an Order of Justice does not plead injunctive relief, it is sufficient for it to be signed
by the plaintiff 's advocate before sending it, alongside a summons, to the Viscount's Department who will effect personal service on the defendant.104 The summons should action the
defendant to appear at the Royal Court at a specific time and date to witness the confirmation of the Order of Justice. This is usually at the first Friday sitting of the Samedi Division
following service. An Order of Justice containing injunctive relief follows a different procedural path and must be submitted to the Bailiff 's Chambers and be signed by him before
being delivered to the Viscount for personal service.105
Because an Order of Justice requires personal service by the Viscount106 and especially in
cases where injunctive relief is sought on an ex parte basis, a plaintiff effectively loses control of the timetable for commencing an action when depositing the Order of Justice with
the Viscount's department for service. The fact of a looming prescription date should be
brought to the attention of the Bailiff 's Chambers and Viscount's Department.107 Once
served, the expiration of prescription is effectively paused until the date and time listed in
99 In re Bhandher [1997 JLR N-16B]; Perczynski (née La Rocque) v Perczynski [2005 JLR N [23]] unless the
matters forming the factual matrix upon which the setting aside is sought are set out in the Representation with
sufficient clarity; eg In the Matter of the Strathmullen Trust [2014 (1) JLR 309].
100 Whether an action for an order for removal is best commenced by an Order of Justice or by Representation
is, in practice and on the authorities, very finely balanced. It is common to see such relief sought in actions commenced by either form of originating process. The jurisdiction to remove a trustee is part of the Court's inherent
jurisdiction to intervene in the administration of a trust and as such is not strictly a cause of action. Given that,
and the greater latitude afforded to the drafting of a Representation, it is often the preferred choice for many
practitioners.

102 See In re Esteem Settlement [2002 JLR 53].
103 As to which see Ch 15.
104 As to the form of summons, see RCR 2004 Sch 2.
105 RCR 20/5 Note also that by the same rule, any solicitor who applies to the Bailiff for an Order of Justice
containing an interlocutory injunction must give a written undertaking to the Bailiff that he or she has instructed
an advocate in relation to the proceedings.

the summons for the defendant served with the Order of Justice to appear before the Court.
If, once served, the proceedings are not properly tabled, time will begin to run again and the
defendant will need to be re-summonsed and the action re-tabled.
There is no case law as to the consequences of a failure by the Viscount to serve proceedings before the expiration of prescription. Where depositing the order of justice for service
by the Viscount is mandatory by virtue of a statute, rule or practice and a failure to serve
results in the claim becoming time barred, a plaintiff may be able to rely upon the principle
of empêchement under which prescription is postponed until after the Viscount has effected
service of the proceedings. Once the Order of Justice is served the plaintiff is responsible
for tabling the action.

ii. Tabling the Action
1-34

1-35

Tabling is the act of notifying the Royal Court that the plaintiff intends to proceed with its
action. Once tabled, the action is listed for the date and time given in the summons served
on the defendant, which usually coincides with the next Friday sitting of the Samedi Division. Tabling (except in proceedings commenced by Order of Justice containing injunctive
relief), is the first point in the course of proceedings at which the dispute is brought to
the Royal Court's attention. Unlike the current practice in England and Wales, there is no
equivalent of 'issuing' a claim with an administrative number with the Court before service of the particulars of claim on the other parties. To table the action, the plaintiff must
deposit the Order of Justice, the requisite court stamps108 and the billet109 with the Greffier
by midday on the Thursday preceding the usual Friday sitting of the Samedi Division. The
Greffier shall place the action on a list known as 'the Table'110 which is a public list of the
new civil cases before the Samedi Division.
If a defendant wishes to defend the action for which they are summonsed, provided they
are able to or deemed to provide an address for service in Jersey,111 the defendant should
request that the action will be placed on a list (known as the Pending List) while it is prepared for trial.112 This is also the usual procedure where the defendant wishes to set aside
the proceedings or service of the proceedings, seek a declaration that the proceedings
have not been properly served, discharge an order granting leave to serve the proceedings
out of the jurisdiction, or seek a declaration that the Court has no jurisdiction over that
party in respect of the subject matter of the claim or the relief or remedy sought in the
proceedings.113

iii. Failure to Table
If the plaintiff fails to table the action, there is no mechanism for the action to be listed, and
will be deemed to have been discontinued.114 It follows that if the plaintiff still wishes to
bring its action, it must re-serve and re-table a fresh Order of Justice. An Order of Justice
that is not tabled for the date to which the defendant is summonsed cannot simply be recycled with the same originating document purported to be served and re-tabled.115 Commencing proceedings, particularly where the expiry of prescription is in prospect, requires
careful timetabling. The summons and the Order of Justice to be served by the Viscount
must state the date and time at which the defendant is to appear to witness the confirmation of the Order of Justice. There must be gap of at least four clear days between the date
of service of that summons and the Friday hearing in the Samedi Division.116 The Royal
Court may not give judgment in default in any action unless applied for by the plaintiff and
the court is satisfied that the summons was validly served and in due time; and the billet
was tabled in due time.117

1-36

B. Representation
A Representation is a form of originating process by which the Court's attention is brought
to a particular issue or set of facts upon which the party bringing the Representation ('the
Representor') seeks relief in the form of either a determination or direction. A Representation is broadly the Jersey equivalent of the RSC originating summons, now succeeded by a
CPR Part 8 Claim Form.118 As a form of originating process, a Representation is of a wholly
different character to an Order of Justice. A Representation is directed at bringing a matter of controversy to the Court's attention rather than alleging facts which, if proved, will
amount to a cause of action against a defendant and for which the party bringing the action
is entitled to relief.
There are few hard-and-fast rules as to what a Representation needs to contain. At its least, a
Representation must contain a narrative setting out the grounds on which the Representor
seeks his relief and unlike an Order of Justice119 is usually supported by an affidavit. It is not
a valid criticism that a Representation fail to allege facts which if proven would amount to a
cause of action and entitle a party to injunctive, proprietary or pecuniary relief.120
To commence an action by Representation is useful in circumstances where the relief
sought will only affect the Representor. A Representation is often used as a means of seek114

Racz v Perrier Labesse 1979 JJ 158.
Virani v Virani [2000 JLR 203].
116 RCR 2004, r 5/15, ie if the plaintiff intends to table the action for a Friday hearing, service must be effected,
at least by the close of business on the preceding Friday in order to afford sufficient time.
117 RCR 2004, r 5/17.
118 RSC Ord 7. However the comparison with the CPR pt 8 procedure is not exact as a Representation, unlike
pt 8, may contain issues of factual controversy. In Jersey the Representation emerged from an older form of proceeding, the remonstrance, which was, and the Representation remains, a convenient form of originating process
where it is unclear how many parties ought to be joined to ensure the court feels able to grant the relief sought.

ing early direction from the Court in relation to how the Representor should proceed in a
matter. A Representation is often used where there is no prescribed means of bringing a
matter before the Court. In practice, the Representation is often used in proceedings under
particular enactments, for example under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991121 but the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 contains no direction on the form of originating process to be used. The
authors would suggest that a Representation is the appropriate form of originating process
for the following types of proceedings involving trusts:
1.

2.

applications by the trustee, beneficiary or any person having connection with the trust
under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 for directions on any question concerning the execution or administration of the trust, the exercise of any power, discretion or duty vested in the trustee, the appointment or removal of a trustee, enforcer or
protector, the trustee's remuneration or a question as to the conduct of the trustee;122
applications by trustees for Beddoe relief;
applications for construction and/or the rectification of documents;123
applications under Article 47 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 for an order consenting
to the variation of a trust on behalf of minors, unborn or unascertained beneficiaries;
applications under Article 47A of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 under the Court's cypres and equivalent jurisdiction for non-charitable purpose trusts;
applications under Articles 47D to 47J of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (the Court's
power to reverse dispositions into and out of trust and the exercise of fiduciary powers on grounds of equitable mistake and/or defective decision-making;)124
applications to register a foreign judgment under the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960;125
applications to bring an alleged breach of an injunction (commenced by Order of
Justice) to the Court's attention;
applications for an order that a party be held in contempt for disobedience of a court
order;126
orders for the removal and/or replacement of a trustee;127

121 eg ibid in relation to Art 213 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, which provides that on application made
by any person appearing to the Court to be interested, the Court may make an order declaring the dissolution of
a company void and give such directions and make such provisions as seem just. See also Pacific Investments Ltd
v Christiansen & others [1995 JLR 250], a Representation is the most appropriate form of relief for an application
under Arts 141 and 143 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (Art 141 provides that an application may be made
for an order under Art 143 on the ground of unfair prejudice).
122 Art 51 is the statutory expression of the Court's inherent jurisdiction over every aspect of the administration of trusts. As such, this expansive jurisdiction encompasses a vast array of different forms of relief that may
be commenced by Representation, many of which are not capable of being neatly analysed as causes of action
properly so called.
123 Trilogy Management Ltd v YT Charitable Foundation (Intl) Ltd [2013 (2) JLR 265].
124 By the Trusts (Amendment No 6) (Jersey) Law 2013 Jersey enacted this statutory regime to replicate the
separate but closely aligned rules of equitable mistake and the rule that had become known as 'the rule in Re
Hastings Bass'.
125 As to which, see Ch 15.
126 Although a recent unreported decision of the former Bailiff has indicated that contempt proceedings may
be commenced by way of summons as an application within the main proceedings.
127 Whether an action for an order for removal is best commenced by an Order of Justice or by Representation
is, in practice and on the authorities, very finely balanced. It is common to see such relief sought in actions commenced by either form of originating process. The jurisdiction to remove a trustee is part of the Court's inherent

applications for the Court to remove and/or replace an enforcer of a non-charitable
purpose trust;
applications for the Court to remove and/or replace a protector or other power
holder;128 and
claims by beneficiaries for the disclosure of documents or information from the
trustee.129

It follows that until the Court gives directions as to how the Representation is to proceed
there is only one party to the proceedings: the party bringing the Representation known as
the Representor. At the presentation of the Representation, the Court should be invited to
make orders convening such other parties that appear to have an interest in the proceedings
and effecting service upon them. The Court will usually name a return date at which the
Court will then give further directions depending on the issues raised for determination in
the Representation. It is the responsibility of the Representor to serve the Representation in
accordance with the convening orders.

1-40

i. Commencement of Proceedings by Representation
Proceedings by ex parte representation should be commenced by depositing the Representation (and any supporting documentation) with the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary and with
a copy to the Judicial Greffe at least 24 hours before the hearing at which the Representor
wishes the matter to be presented to the Court.130 The first hearing of the Representation will be the regular Friday afternoon sitting of the Samedi Division (with the exception of breaches of injunctions).131 A Representation, unlike an Order of Justice, is not
formally tabled. However, consistent with the procedure for tabling an Order of Justice, a
­Representation and any supporting documents132 should be lodged with the Judicial Greffe
by midday on the Thursday prior to the first Samedi Court hearing at which the Representation is sought to be presented. Representations are called on by the Greffier after the
passing of hereditary contracts but before the adjourned and new actions commenced by
Order of Justice. This is a public hearing. It is not uncommon, particularly in Representations that seek relief and the intervention of the Royal Court under its inherent supervisory
jurisdiction in relation to trusts, that privacy may be a concern and the Representor may
request that the case be placed bas de la liste and heard when the court has been cleared.133
At that first Samedi Court hearing it is incumbent upon the Representor to set out what the

jurisdiction to intervene in the administration of a trust and, as such, is not strictly a cause of action for which
removal is a remedy to which the plaintiff is entitled if his case is made out. Given the numerous bases upon which
a trustee may be sought to be removed, and the greater latitude afforded to the drafting of a Representation it is
often the preferred choice for many practitioners.

Litigating in Jersey

Representation is about and to obtain initial directions as to how it is to proceed. Where
other parties' interests are affected by the relief sought in the Representation, it will be
appropriate to seek orders convening those parties to the proceedings. Where those parties are overseas, it will be necessary for the Representor to make an oral application for
service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction.134 By r 6/37 RCR 2004, the procedure to
be followed in proceedings commenced by Representation is extremely flexible and is at the
Court's discretion.135

C. Summons
1-42

The third form of originating process, although in practice never encountered when commencing trust litigation (or any litigation of value or complexity other than a claim for the
payment of a liquidated sum), is by way of summons.

i. Interlocutory Summonses
1-43

In the context of trust litigation, a summons is only usually encountered either as a means
of obtaining inter partes interlocutory relief within proceedings already commenced by
way of Order of Justice or Representation or to obtain directions as to the future case
management of those proceedings.136 In contrast with the procedural rules governing the
commencement of proceedings before the Royal Court, where there is no formal court
involvement until the matter is formally brought before the Samedi Court, the vast majority of interlocutory applications in trust disputes in Jersey are commenced by way of service
of a summons, a process which does mandate the Court's early intervention.137 That said,
the following categories of proceeding, which might otherwise be considered as 'interlocutory' in that they occur before trial, are required to be commenced by way of free-standing
proceedings commenced by Order of Justice:
1.

All forms of prohibitive and mandatory injunctive relief138 including Mareva/freezing
injunctions139 and Anton Piller/search orders,140 and ordres provisoires including an
arrêt entre mains141 and saisie.142

134 As to what is required in any such application, see Ch 2.

135 There are no template directions as to how a Representation should proceed. A form of summons for directions is annexed to the RCR 2004 in Sch 3. The Court may apply these directions and any other rules of procedure
that would otherwise apply to a claim commenced by Order of Justice by virtue of RCR 2004, r 6/37, with appropriate adaptation to fit the issues in the representation.
136 RCR 2004, 20/1(1).
137 ibid. The limited exceptions being that an application to court alleging breach of an injunction or an arret
(prior to its confirmation) is commenced by way of Representation.

Subject to limited exceptions in the Royal Court Rules,145 the Inferior Number of the Royal
Court and the Greffier share a concurrent jurisdiction to hear and determine interlocutory
applications commenced by summons. In practice, this jurisdiction is effectively delegated
from the Inferior Number to be exercised by the Greffier, sitting as Master, alone and without Jurats. In respect of interlocutory matters, the Greffier performs a similar function to
that of a Master in the Chancery Division of the English High Court.

1-44

Only the following summonses can be validly served by a party, without the countersignature of the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary or the Greffier's Judicial Secretary (as appropriate):

1-45

1.
2.
3.

a simple summons used as a form of originating process in and of itself;
a summons requiring a party to appear before the Royal Court to witness the confirmation of an Order of Justice;
a summons requiring a party who has been convened to appear before the Royal Court
on the return date of a Representation commenced ex parte.

Every other summons146 must bear the signature of the advocate whose summons it is, and
the countersignature of either the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary (for summonses to be heard
before the Inferior Number) or the Master's Secretary (for summonses to be heard before
the Master) as well as the payment of the appropriate value of court stamps, before the
summons can be validly served.147 The Secretary's countersignature will not be given until
a date has been listed or 'fixed' for the hearing of the summons.
Jersey's Royal Court does not have a central listing office for hearings. Instead, the Judicial
Greffe and the Bailiff 's Chambers (under the respective auspices of the Greffier's Judicial
Secretary and Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary) serve as the respective listing officers for hearings
before Master and the Royal Court. The Judicial Greffe also has a separate listing office
function for hearings before the Court of Appeal.148 An application for an interlocutory
order by summons comprises two stages: first, the arrangement of an appointment to fix a
date for the hearing of the summons (known as a 'date-fix') and, secondly, the hearing of
the summons itself.

The first question is whether the subject matter of the summons falls to be determined
before the Greffier or the Royal Court. This will determine who is required to countersign
the summons. Schedule 1 of the RCR 2004 sets out the matters in respect of which reference
in the rules to 'the Court' does not include the Greffier and consequently these matters are
excluded from the Master's jurisdiction and must be commenced by way of summons sent
to the Bailiff 's Chambers for signature by the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary.149
Summonses for interlocutory relief are not formally tabled in the same way as actions commenced by Order of Justice which are arranged around the Friday sitting of the Samedi
Division. The Royal Court may hear a summons on any day on which the Court sits.150

ii. Fixing a Date for the Hearing of a Summons before the Greffier or Royal Court
1-50

The date-fix procedure before the Royal Court and Greffier are essentially the same, save
that:

5.

1-51

there is a non-refundable charge for fixing a date for a hearing before the Royal Court
which is not due for hearings before the Greffier;151
the value of the court stamps that must be paid on the summons is different;152
the date-fix appointment is conducted by the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary rather than
the Greffier's;
the minimum number of clear days' notice to the other parties of a date-fix appointment is four days for an appointment before the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary but only
two days when before the Greffier's Judicial Secretary;153 and
the minimum number of clear days between the service and the hearing of the summons is four days for a hearing before the Royal Court but only two days before the
Greffier.154

First, the applicant must informally enquire of the Greffe or the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary
(as the case may be) and the other parties as to the parties' and Court's availability for a
date-fix appointment and a date for a hearing of the summons. Not all parties to the proceedings need to be convened to the summons, only parties between whom there is a lis
need be summonsed. For date-fix appointments before the Greffier Substitute, the party
applying for a date to be fixed for the hearing of the summons ('the applicant') is required,
not less than two clear days before so doing, to notify in writing the other parties to the
summons of the applicant's intention to make the application and of the date and time
at which the applicant intends to apply.155 For date-fix appointments before the Bailiff 's

Judicial Secretary, the requirements are the same, substituting the notice period of two clear
days with four.
While a date-fix appointment can, if it is contested, be determined by the Bailiff sitting
alone,156 a hearing of an interlocutory summons before the Royal Court, if it involves any
question of fact, will require at least two Jurats. As there are only 12 Jurats at any one time,
not allowing for illness or absence, the Court (sitting in the Inferior number) can only deal
with a maximum of six matters at once.157
If the date for the hearing of a summons can be agreed between the parties, it is not necessary to proceed with a formal date-fix appointment; the court will simply fix the date by
consent without the attendance of the parties. However, where no agreement can be made
on the date for a hearing of the summons, it is necessary for the court to fix a date and the
following procedure applies:158
1.

2.

3.
4.

The applicant seeking a date to be fixed for a hearing of a summons must give no less
than two clear days' notice to the other parties in writing of the date and time of the
date-fix appointment.159
At the date-fix appointment, the parties usually attend by an intermediary (an advocate
is not necessarily required) on the relevant Judicial Secretary who, having consulted the
court's diary, will attempt to coordinate with counsel to fix a date for a hearing of the
summons.
Where the date proposed to be fixed by the Judicial Secretary is unacceptable to a party,
the date-fix appointment can be renewed before a judge at a hearing in chambers.160
When a date has been fixed for the hearing of the summons, the application is required
to serve the summons on all other parties summonsed in the usual way.161 Subject to
contrary provision elsewhere in the RCR,162 or an order permitting the abridgement of

156 Including for these purposes the Deputy Bailiff or any of the Commissioners (see the Royal Court (Jersey)
Law 1948, Art 12 and the Deputy Bailiff (Appointment & Functions) (Jersey) Law 1958, Art 4).
157 If the Royal Court is required to sit, as it not infrequently does, in the Superior Number this can have a dramatic impact on the Court's capacity (remembering that the Royal Court exercises a universal jurisdiction to hear
criminal, public, family as well as civil law matters). Further, even allowing for the fact that the Court of Appeal
does not sit permanently, when it does sit, it does impact on the Court's physical capacity. The Royal Court House
contains only 3 permanent courtrooms, with a fourth only available when it is not in use as the States' Assembly
chamber. It is not without precedent in the modern era for the Royal Court to sit outside the Royal Court House
where the physical capacity available within the Victorian building is insufficient for the Court's requirements.
158 RC PD 05/10. There is no equivalent practice direction pertaining to the procedure for a date-fix appointment before the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary, however, the procedure is the same.
159 4 clear days in the case of a date-fix before the Bailiff 's Judicial Secretary.
160 This is known as a 'contested date-fix' and is generally only necessary in cases of urgency or if it is not otherwise possible to fix a date by consent. A hearing date fixed by agreement before the Judicial Secretary cannot
usually be vacated by a party unilaterally applying to renew the date-fix appointment before the judge. A party is
expected to elect at the appointment either to accept the date fixed by agreement or to renew it before the judge.
If a party subsequently becomes unhappy with the date fixed by agreement, the appropriate procedure is, in the
absence of consent, to summons the other parties to a hearing to vacate the fixed date and fix a new one. That
summons must go through its own date-fix procedure.
161 See RCR 2004, r 5/4 as to the circumstances in which personal service of a summons is required. In all other
cases, service may be effected by ordinary service.
162 eg an applicant for the hearing of a summons for directions must give at least 2 clear days' notice between
service of the summons and the hearing; for hearings before the Royal Court, it is at least 4 clear days, for the hearing of a summons for summary judgment or strike out application it is at least 10 clear days.

time, the applicant must give a set number of clear days' notice between service of the
summons and the hearing to which it relates. That is at least two clear days for hearings
before the Master and four clear days for hearings before the Royal Court.163

iii. Abridgements of Time
1-54

If the party issuing the summons wishes to truncate the time he is required to give the other
parties for either the date-fix appointment and/or service of the summons before the hearing, he must make a supporting application by letter to the Bailiff 's or Master's Secretary (as
the case may be) setting out the case for urgency alongside the draft summons, copied to the
other parties.164 That letter usually accompanies the summons and must set out the reasons
why an abridgement of time should be given. The letter must be copied to the other parties
to the summons to give them opportunity to object to the abridgement of time. If a party
wishes to object to the request for an abridgment of time he must notify the ­appropriate
Judicial Secretary forthwith upon receipt of the applicant's letter, failing which the application will be considered. Where there is an objection, the objecting party is usually given
opportunity to attend, to make submissions in this regard unless the Court considers that
the nature of the particular application for abridgement does not require such an opportunity to be given. The parties are to give notice and make arrangements between themselves
to attend and make their representations. The time and date of the hearing to consider such
representations will be fixed by the Bailiff or the Master having regard to the urgency of the
matter and to the availability of a judge. The parties are expected to make themselves available to attend when directed, however short the notice. If a party fails to attend, the judge
will proceed on the determination of the application for abridgment in the absence of such
party. The Bailiff or Master will determine the application for an abridgment of time and
the parties are notified as to the time and date on which they are required to attend for the
date-fix appointment and/or of the truncated period between service of the summons and
the hearing.

D. Commencing Proceedings Using the Wrong Form of Originating
Process
1-55

Non-compliance with the rules, including commencement by way of the wrong form of
originating process (notwithstanding the Royal Court Rules do not exhaustively state how
proceedings are to be commenced) does not render the proceedings void unless the court
so directs although proceedings may be set aside, amended or otherwise dealt with as the
Court thinks fit under RCR 10/6.165 Were a plaintiff, for example, to commence an action

163 eg an applicant for the hearing of a summons for directions must give at least 2 clear days' notice between
service of the summons and the hearing; for hearings before the Royal Court, it is at least 4 clear days, for the
hearing of a summons for an interim payment or summary judgment it is at least 10 clear days; see RCR 2004, rr
8/1(4) and 7/1(5) respectively.
164 RC PD 05/23. Assumes the other parties to the summons do not consent to the abridgment of time, where
there is consent, no formal abridgment application is required.

for breach of trust by way of Representation rather than by way of Order of Justice, the
more liberal approach to pleading matters in Representations may lead to the action being
struck out for pleading insufficient facts to make out a cause of action or prompt the court
to make an order for further or better particulars.

E. Pre-Action Conduct and Pre-Action Disclosure
Jersey's civil procedure rules do not provide a formal mechanism for pre-action disclosure
in trust litigation outside the Norwich Pharmacal/Bankers Trust jurisdiction.166 Neither do
the Royal Court Rules mandate the parties to attempt compliance with any form of formal
pre-action protocol with a view to settling their dispute. While no formal procedure exists,
the failure to engage in at least an attempt at pre-action settlement is likely to impact on the
Court's general discretion as to costs at the close of proceedings.167 In practice, pre-action
conduct is increasingly an area in which Jersey practitioners look to England as a source of
good practice, irrespective that the Royal Court Rules 2004 contain no formal requirement
to that effect. Service of proceedings should usually be preceded by a letter before action.168

1-56

F. Service of Process
Jersey has complex rules concerning the service of court process by which proceedings are
commenced. A person is not a party to proceedings until properly served.169 Part 5 of the
Royal Court Rules 2004 is concerned with service of process within the jurisdiction by way
of summons requiring a defendant or party cited in an Order of Justice to appear before the
Royal Court. Part 5, other than Rules 5/10,170 5/15,171 5/16172 and 5/17173 apply to all summonses whether they are served within or outside the jurisdiction. The substantive law and
procedure as to service outside the jurisdiction is dealt with as a discrete topic in Chapter 2.174
The service of originating process has the effect of commencing an action as at that moment
of service. The party served is thereby convened as a party to the proceedings and must

166 The Law Reform (Disclosure and Conduct before Action) (Jersey) Law 1999 applies only to claims in respect
of damages for personal injuries or death. As an action by way of an Order of Justice is required to commence
an application for discovery of documents under the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, it is strictly a misnomer to
describe the process as one of pre-action discovery.

attend the Court on the date to which he is summoned either in person or through an advocate, in default of which judgment may be entered against him. Prescription is suspended
upon service of proceedings.175 However, suspension of prescription ceases, and time again
begins to run again against the plaintiff, where proceedings are not tabled and are deemed
discontinued.176 Service may be effected in one of three ways: ordinary service, personal
service or substituted service. There is no alignment between the three methods of service
and the three forms of originating process.

i. Ordinary Service
1-58

Rule 5/6 RCR 2004, which governs ordinary service within the jurisdiction, is lifted almost
word for word from the former RSC Ord 65, r 5. Ordinary service is the method of service
appropriate for any document in any cause or matter unless any enactment, rule or court
or order otherwise expressly provides.177 When ordinary service is the permitted method of
service for a document, service may alternatively be effected by personal service.178 In practice, ordinary service is limited to commencement of actions by simple summons (which
are largely outside the scope of this text) and service of interlocutory summonses. Rule
5/6(1) provides the manner in which ordinary service may be effected, either:
1.
2.
3.
4.

1-59

by leaving it at the proper address of the person to be served;
by post;179
by fax; or
in such other manner as the Court may direct.

Service is effected if one of the methods of ordinary service can be shown to have been
carried out or the document can be shown to have reached the person to be served, for
example if the person appears at court to answer a summons to witness confirmation of an
Order of Justice. A document will not have been served by post if it is returned undelivered
despite being properly addressed, prepaid and posted to the proper address.180 The Royal
Court will not entertain an application for judgment in default unless the Court is satisfied
that 'the summons was validly served in due time' at which point the party seeking judgment should make disclosure of all relevant facts so as to ensure the Court is not misled.181
a. Proper Address

1-60

In a somewhat circular definition, an address is a person's 'proper address', if that person
has given that address for service.182 A plaintiff must himself provide a proper address for

shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting a letter containing a document. Jersey's postal service does not operate a delivery service based upon a class of postage. This simplifies the process of
calculating the date of deemed service of a document.

service or its claim may be struck out.183 A defendant must also provide a proper address
for service if he wishes to be permitted to defend an action.184 If the Court is satisfied a
party will not receive notice of any documents sent to or left at that address, the defendant's
Answer may be struck out.185 If there is no address for service, the proper address in the
case of an individual is that person's usual or last known address.186 It is the authors' view
that this rule is not to be used by plaintiff, who knows or suspects a party has left Jersey
to live abroad, to effect service at the last known address for the defendant in Jersey. It is
more appropriate, in those circumstances, to seek leave to serve out of the jurisdiction and
propose substituted service abroad. In ordering substituted service on a person out of the
jurisdiction, the manner of service ordered by the court may be by substitution effected
within the jurisdiction.187 Under RSC Ord 65, r 5 'address' included both a domestic and a
business address and the words 'usual or last known address' should be construed disjunctively so that service may be affected at either place.188 Rule 5/6(2)(c) provides that in the
case of individuals suing or being sued in the name of a firm, the proper address for service
is the principal or last known place of business of a firm in Jersey. The 'principal place of
business' is where the general superintendence and management of the business is carried
out, ie where central management and control actually abides.189
A person must be ordinarily served at their proper address unless that person has no address
for service, in which case the proper address is as deemed by RCR 5/6(2)(a)-(d), being:
1.

1-61

in any case, the business address of the advocate or solicitor (if any) who has undertaken in writing to accept service on behalf of that person in the proceedings in connection with which service of the document in question is to be effected;190
in the case of an individual, that person's usual or last known address;191
in the case of individuals suing or being sued in the name of a firm, the principal or last
known place of business of the firm in Jersey; or
in the case of a body corporate, the registered or principal office of the body.

b. RCR 5/6(1)(a)-'Leaving it at the Proper Address'

at that address. Service is not good if the proper address is a block of flats or offices and the
­document is left with a concierge, or similar individual, and not at the individual flat or
office. The emphasis in the leading English authority of the time (that may not be followed
in Jersey) was to the effect that the proceedings must be brought to the attention of the
defendant and that mere delivery at the proper address was insufficient.192
c. RCR 5/6(1)(b)-'Post'
1-63

Service by post includes ordinary, registered and recorded delivery post. Within the island,
Jersey's postal service does not operate a delivery service based upon a class of postage. This
simplifies the process of calculating the date of deemed service of a document.193 It may be
undesirable to require the party to be served to sign for the document as this will permit the
party to be served an opportunity to refuse delivery. As to the deemed dates of service by
post see Table 1.1. There is no collection or delivery of letters on public holidays and Sundays. There is a rebuttable presumption that service has been effected if proof is given that a
letter containing the document has been properly addressed, prepaid and posted when the
matter is tabled.194 The presumption of service by post is rebuttable and will yield if there is
proof to the contrary.195 Note also that judgment in default cannot be entered if the Court
is not satisfied the summons was both validly served and in due time.196 Service is deemed
to be effected when a document is served in accordance with the rules and if a defendant is
temporarily away from his address, for example on holiday, and returns to find that judgment has been found against him, he is not entitled, simply by reason of his temporary
absence, to have the judgment set aside.197 A judgment in default based on the assumption that a document has been served because it has been properly addressed, prepaid and
posted to the proper address and not returned undelivered is regular, and the judgment can
only be set aside upon a reasonably arguable defence on the merits.198
d. RCR 5/6(1)(c)-'by Fax'

1-64

Service by fax is now rarely used since electronic communications became routinely made
by email. Ordinary service may be effected by fax in accordance with rule 5/6(4) RCR 2004,
which provides for service by fax between parties acting by a Jersey solicitor or advocate
and the party served has indicated in writing to the advocate or solicitor serving the document willingness to accept service by fax at a specified fax number and the document is

served at least 4 clear days before the day on which the defendant is required to appear; See RCR 2004, r 5/15.

t­ ransmitted to that number. It follows that where one party is not legally represented, service by fax may not be used. The inscription of a fax number on the writing paper of an
advocate or solicitor is sufficient to indicate willingness to accept service by fax unless that
advocate or solicitor states otherwise in writing.199 Service is effected by transmission of
the document to the business address of such advocate or solicitor at the number he has
specified200 and by sending a copy of the document to that advocate or solicitor by one of
the other prescribed methods of ordinary service as soon as is practicable, failing which the
document is deemed not to have been served.201 By rule 5/6(5), where a fax is transmitted
on a business day before 5 pm, it is, unless the contrary is shown, deemed to be served on
that day and otherwise is served on the next business day. It is therefore important that a
copy of the transmission confirmation receipt is retained and the time on a fax machine is
accurate. A party seeking to preclude service by fax, must give proper notice to the party
from which the ability to serve by fax is being withdrawn.202
e. Service by Email
The RCR do not formally recognise the ability of parties to effect routine ordinary service
of any document, including originating process, by email. However, service of correspondence and other documents not mandated to be served personally (such as summonses)
are in practice routinely served by email, with a hard copy by post or by hand. This is so
despite there being no Jersey equivalent of CPR Part 6 PD 6A.4.1(2) by which an email
address set out on the writing paper of the solicitor acting for the party to be served or an
email address set out on a pleading or a response to a claim filed with the Court may be
taken as a sufficient written indication that that party accepts service by email. Under rule
5/6(1)d RCR 2004, the Court retains power to order that ordinary service of a document
may be effected in such other manner as it may direct. It is not uncommon for the court to
authorise substituted service by email under rule 5/10 RCR 2004 where an email address is
available and the Court is satisfied that the email address belongs to the party to be served
giving rise to a reasonable inference that they will receive what is sent. Parties are also free
to reach their own agreement as to service even if outside the Royal Court Rules 2004 which
could encompass an agreement to accept service by email.203

f. Service on Corporate Bodies
Aside from ordinary service under rule 5/6 RCR 2004, a document may be served on any
company incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 or its predecessor laws by
leaving it at or sending it by post to the registered office of the company.204 A Jersey company's registered office can be obtained from the publicly accessible Registry maintained

case may be, in that return; and

1-67

Article 83 Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires a company to keep at its registered office
a register of its directors and secretary. Notwithstanding that recourse to this provision is
only necessary where a public company does not have a registered office at which the register can be inspected, the legislation provides that the register shall be available to inspection by any person on payment of a fee not exceeding a published maximum. A copy of a
company's register of members can only be obtained on payment of a fee not exceeding
the published maximum and in the case of a public company accompanied by a declaration under Article 46 of the 1991 Law. The company is obliged to comply within 10 days
after the receipt of the payment and the declaration by making the copy of the register of
members available at the place where the register is kept, for collection by that person during business hours. A Jersey company's annual returns are available from the JFSC Registry
upon payment of a small fee. A Jersey company's memorandum of association is publicly
available from the JFSC Registry for the payment of a small fee. It should be noted that these
additional statutory provisions are permissive and not mandatory.207

leave to serve an overseas corporate principal through a Jersey resident agent in the circumstances set out in rule 5/11 RCR 2004.
h. Service on a Party's Advocate or Solicitor
The address for service of a defendant who fails to provide an address for service, but has
at any time been legally represented in the proceedings, will be deemed to be the address
of his last advocate or solicitor on the record.210 Rule 6/6(2) is not satisfied merely by his
advocate's putting in an Answer, since the terms of rule 5/6(2)(a) RCR 2004 make it clear
that an advocate or solicitor willing to accept service on behalf of a defendant without an
address for service should give an undertaking in writing to that effect. An Answer lacking
such an undertaking is incomplete and may be struck out either at the discretion of the
Court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction or under rule 6/13 RCR 2004.211 In practice, a defendant's advocate will usually insert at the foot of the defendant's Answer a section
headed 'Defendant's address for service' followed by the address of the advocate or solicitor.
A party may change his advocate or solicitor at any stage of proceedings but until notice of
any such change is filed by the new advocate or solicitor and copies of the notice are served
on every other party to the proceedings (not being a party in default), the former advocate
or solicitor shall be taken to be the advocate or solicitor of the party.212 Accordingly, service
of a document on the advocate or solicitor will be good service on the party until notice is
served on every other party to the proceedings. Rule 20/4 applies not only to a party who
changes his advocate, but also to a party who withdraws instructions from his advocate
without instructing another. Service is effective on a solicitor or advocate who is on the
record for a party, even where that solicitor or advocate is no longer instructed be the party
(because he cannot be removed from the record until the new advocate or solicitor files and
serves on all parties a notice of acting).213 The advocate on the record for a party remains
the party's advocate in substance, not merely in form, even if in reality he ceases to act for
the party, until notice is given of his replacement and he continues to have obligations and
liabilities in that regard.214

i. Deemed Dates for Ordinary Service of Documents
Jersey's process rules provide for a deemed date of service of documents depending on the
form of ordinary service used. Public holidays must be discounted for the purposes of day
counting. The working presumption of a deemed date service will also yield to positive
evidence that service was not in fact effected on the deemed date.

j. Public Holidays
1-71

1-72

It is only possible to be served by fax on a business day.215 It is not possible to be served by
fax on either a Saturday or a Sunday. The following are statutory public holidays in Jersey216
and therefore not 'business days': 1 January, Good Friday, Easter Monday, the first Monday
in May, 9 May, the last Monday in May, the last Monday in August, 25 December, 26 December. Public holidays falling on a weekend, except for the annual Liberation Day celebration
on 9 May, falling on a Saturday or Sunday, are substituted for the next business day, eg if
Christmas Day and Boxing Day fall on a Saturday and Sunday respectively, the following
Monday and Tuesday are public holidays and as such are not deemed to be business days
for the purposes of service.217
A document posted on a public holiday will not be deemed to have been collected until the
next collection day. Likewise a document that would otherwise be deemed to be delivered
on a public holiday by virtue of rule 5/6(3) RCR 2004 will not be deemed to have been
delivered until the next delivery day. Rule 1/4 provides an automatic extension of time if
the time prescribed by the rules for doing any act before the Greffier, or at the offices of
the Viscount or the Greffier, expires on a day on which those offices are or are required (by
virtue of it being a public holiday) to be closed and, by reason thereof, cannot be done on
that day. By virtue of this rule, the act will be deemed to have been done on time if done on
the next day on which those offices are open. This rule is significant in respect of tabling an
action if the Thursday prior to the usual Friday session of the Samedi division is a public
holiday. The rule also has general effect if the deadline for doing any act before the Greffier

215 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are business days (subject to Jersey's public holiday
legislation which can make what would otherwise be a weekday into a public holiday and therefore not a business
day).

or at the Viscount's Department or Greffe expires on a Sunday or public holiday by virtue
of any judgment, order or direction. This rule only applies if an act cannot be done by reason of the Court offices being closed. The rule reflects the customary law position: a period
of prescription which expires on a day on which the offices are closed and the Viscount
accordingly is unable to serve the same under rule 5/5 RCR 2004, is likely to amount to an
empêchement de fait and time is extended to the next day on which the offices are open and
proceedings capable of being served.
k. Proving Ordinary Service
Ordinary service is usually proved by an affidavit of service compliant with rule 5/13 RCR
2004. The billet that is filed when tabling the action must set out the contents of the record
of service.

1-73

ii. Personal Service
Virtually all trust disputes are commenced by personal service of the Order of Justice or a
Representation, which may be effected on an individual or a corporation. Where service
of any document is mandated to be by way of personal service pursuant to rule 5/4 RCR
2004 within the jurisdiction, then service is effected through the Viscount. Where service is
effected outside the jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon the party serving the document to
make their own arrangements for personal service in the territory in which the party is to
be served and have those arrangements approved by the Royal Court as part of any application to serve out.218

1-74

a. Personal Service on an Individual
Personal service of an Order of Justice is effected by the Viscount leaving a copy of the
Order of Justice and the summons to witness the confirmation of the Order of Justice at
a specific date and time, with the person to be served.219 An individual personally served
with a copy of an Order of Justice is also permitted to be shown a copy of the original at the
same time as they receive their copy. Personal service of any other document is effected by
physically leaving it with the person to be served.

1-75

b. Personal Service on a Corporation
Personal service on a corporation may be effected by serving it in accordance with rule 5/7,
above, on any director, manager, company secretary or other similar officer of the corporation, or by leaving it at or delivering it to the registered office of the corporation.220

c. When Personal Service is Required
1-77

Personal service is mandatory in the circumstances set out in rule 5/4 RCR 2004; that is to
say the following summonses for appearance before the Royal Court must be served personally if they are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

to witness the confirmation of an Order of Justice;221
for the payment of the amount of a judgment on pain of imprisonment (à peine de
prison);
to appear before the Héritage division;
to reply to an action in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings brought by the Attorney
General;
an application for the grant of leave to enforce a judgement or order against a party
represented by another in representative proceedings;222 or
to summons a witness to give evidence before the Royal Court.223

d. Effecting Personal Service
1-78

Where personal service is required by rule 5/4 RCR 2004, service must be effected by the
Viscount (in practice usually a Viscount Substitute rather than the Viscount herself) rather
than by personal service on the recipient by the plaintiff or his legal representatives directly.
Service through the Viscount is also required:
1.
2.

in an action resulting from the raising of the Clameur de Haro;
in the case of a summons:
i. to witness the confirmation of an arrêt,
ii. to appear in court in pursuance of an Order of Justice regarding the appointment
of an administrator or a guardian,

3.

1-79

to reply to an appeal the determination of which, or to a reference the determination of
which, is within the competence of the Court;224
4. to serve any notice or other document for the purposes of Part 2 of the Court of Appeal
(Jersey) Law 1961.225
Where the document or process is not required to be personally served by the Viscount but
the plaintiff wishes to serve personally anyway, service may still be effected on a voluntary
basis through the Viscount.
e. Personal Service out of the Jurisdiction

1-80

The Viscount will not personally serve proceedings outside the territorial jurisdiction of
the Royal Court. Where personal service is required to be effected on a defendant outside
221 This is the summons that is served, alongside the Order of Justice, by the Viscount at the commencement of
proceedings, see para 1-31 above.
222 RCR 2004, r 4/3(4); as to representative proceedings, see RCR 2004, r 4/3.

Jersey, it falls to the plaintiff to have made arrangements and obtained the leave of the court
to serve the defendant by a particular method (usually via a local firm of lawyers or process
servers) in the foreign jurisdiction.226 Where leave is given to serve a summons out of the
jurisdiction and efforts to personally serve proceedings abroad have been without success
the plaintiff should make a written application, supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances in which service as ordered has failed, to the Master for an order for substituted
service.227 This process can be truncated, and an order for substituted service be obtained
in advance of it becoming apparent that personal service will be impractical.228
f. Proving Personal Service
Personal service by the Viscount within the jurisdiction is proven by a record of service
signed by the Viscount Substitute. The Viscount's record of service, signed by the officer
who serves the process, should state the means, place and date of service and state the means
of knowledge of the identity of the person served.229 Where personal service is effected by
the plaintiff (ie other than in the cases set out in rule 5/4 RCR 2004), the serving party will
be responsible for indorsing the original documents with the appropriate wording as proof
of service or may swear an affidavit of service stating the place, date time and means of
service and stating the means of knowledge of the identity of the person served. Proof of
service, alongside a copy of the served summons, billet and Order of Justice must be lodged
with the Judicial Greffe when the action is tabled.

1-81

iii. Substituted Service
Rule 5/10 provides that in cases where personal service is required but on an ex parte application it appears to the Court to be impractical to effect personal service (or for any other
reason the Court considers it appropriate) it can order substituted service. Substituted service may be ordered of 'any document' and can therefore extend even to orders enforceable
by committal. If substituted service is effected it is equivalent to personal service and judgment thereon will be regular even if in fact the defendant has no actual knowledge of the
proceedings. A defence on the merits would be necessary so as to set aside any judgment.230

1-82

An application for substituted service is usually made in writing to the Judicial Greffier and
must be accompanied by an affidavit that evidences why personal service is impractical or
that substituted service is otherwise practical.231 As non-contentious business, the Greffier
has jurisdiction to order substituted service.232 An order for substituted service is not to be
sought merely to prevent an action being prescribed and the Court has no power to extend
a prescription period if personal service would result in the claim being time barred.233

Litigating in Jersey

The word 'impracticable' does not mean impossible but there must be sufficient material
from which a court can conclude that reasonable efforts have been made to effect personal
service and it can therefore be said that personal service is impracticable. Thus, evidence
that a defendant had appeared to be away from his usual residence on one occasion before
personal service was attempted is usually insufficient to satisfy the test. There must be evidence of what enquiries had been made as to where the defendant might be or when he
might be back and whether he could have been served on his return.234 The approach of
the English courts, in interpreting the analogous rule,235 has been that substituted service
should not be ordered if the writ is not likely to reach the defendant or come to the defendant's knowledge although it is not always essential to show that it will. An application for
substituted service must be supported by an affidavit stating the facts on which the application is founded.236 The application in the first instance should be made ex parte on affidavit
to the Greffier. Save in exceptional circumstances, the affidavit should be made by the party
seeking to serve, setting out in detail the facts relied upon to support the claim that every
reasonable line of enquiry has already been tried but without success. It is insufficient to
lodge an affidavit simply saying in general terms that all enquiries have been made or that
the petitioner or respondent knows of no means of getting in contact with the respondent
or other party concerned.237 Because personal service, where it is required by rule 5/4 RCR
2004, is effected by the Viscount, the details as to what steps the Viscount took and why
personal service was ineffective should be included in the affidavit supporting the application for substituted service. Where personal service has been attempted in circumstances
where the Viscount was not required to serve personally (leaving it to the serving party),
then the authors suggest the following steps as appropriate:238 Two calls should be made to
the defendant's residence (if known) otherwise to the defendant's business address (again if
known). If the defendant has left the address, this should be stated in the affidavit. A copy
of the documents sought to be served should be left at the address in a sealed envelope,
addressed to the defendant. The two calls should be made on separate weekdays at reasonable hours. The second call should be made by appointment by letter sent by ordinary
post, giving not less than two clear days' notice, enclosing a copy of the document sought
to be served at the first call and offering the defendant an opportunity to make a different appointment. On keeping the appointment the serving party's process server should
seek an indication whether the defendant had received communications sent to him. The
affidavit for substituted service should deal with the foregoing and state whether the letter
of appointment was returned or not and with any Answer exhibited. The affidavit should
also state whether the defendant is within or without the jurisdiction (or believed to be
so). If there is evidence of deliberate evasion of service this should be stated and the facts
supporting evasion deposed. The affidavit should also state and evidence how the proposed
method of substituted service will probably come to the knowledge of the defendant. In
order to assist in an appropriate order being made, the affidavit should specify the kind of
substituted service sought and may provide alternatives.

a. Method of Substituted Service
The usual method to effect substituted service is by letter although rule 5/10(4) RCR 2004
is very wide and service may be effected by any method the Court considers just. The Court
may order service by other means either on their own or in combination with others,
including service by email. Very rarely will the Court permit substituted service by advertisement and only then if there is good reason to belief the advertisement will be seen by
the defendant.239

1-84

b. Orders for Substituted Service
The template for an order of the Royal Court for substituted service out of the jurisdiction
is in Form 6, scheduled to the Service of Process Rules 1994.240 This template can be used,
with appropriate modifications, for an order for substituted service within the jurisdiction.
The documents in support of the application for substituted service and the order should
be served alongside the documents to be served.

1-85

c. Substituted Service out of the Jurisdiction
Leave must first be obtained for service out of the jurisdiction before substituted service
can be applied for.241 An order for substituted service on a defendant's advocate within the
jurisdiction does not imply leave to serve a defendant who is known to be outside the jurisdiction.242 An application for substituted service out of the jurisdiction must be supported
by an affidavit stating the facts on which the application is founded and the grounds on
which service out is sought. Where leave is given under the Service of Process Rules 1994 to
serve a summons in a foreign country whose government is willing to act as a channel for
the service of process and efforts to serve a document in that country have been without
effect, upon an ex parte application the Bailiff may made an order for substituted service in
the form of Form 6 to the Service of Process Rules.243 This process can be truncated, and
an order for substituted service obtained in advance of it becoming apparent that personal
service will be impractical.244 Prescription of an action ceases to run on the making of the
order for substituted service out of the jurisdiction.245 Prescription will run again if the service that is effected is invalid, the action is discontinued (including deemed discontinuance
by a failure to table) or the defendant is discharged from the action.246

1-86

d. Proving Substituted Service
The means of proving that substituted service was effected differs depending on whether
substituted service is effected inside the jurisdiction or outside (and in which case whether

via r 13 or r 11). Substituted service within the jurisdiction must be proved by a record of
service in the form in Schedule 2 to the RCR 2004 and must state the person by whom, the
means by which, the place at which and the day on which service was effected. In the case
of a document sent by post, the record of service must state the day on which the document was posted and not the day on which the document was served.247 In the rare cases of
substituted service by advertisement, the record of service must either set out the advertisement or include a copy; in both cases the name of the paper and date of the advertisement
must be stated. Where substituted service is to be effected out of the jurisdiction, service
in a Convention country under rule 13 of the Service of Process Rules 1994 is proven by
transmission, through diplomatic channels, of an official certificate to the Bailiff, establishing the date and fact of service of the documents. Service in a non-Convention country
under rule 11 is proven by transmission of an official certificate or declaration upon oath,
transmitted through diplomatic channels by the government of the foreign state or court
of the foreign state to the Bailiff. Provided that it certifies or declares the document to have
been personally served, or to have been duly served upon the defendant in accordance with
the law of such foreign country, or words to that effect, it shall be deemed to be sufficient
proof of such service. In practice, substituted service is rarely effected in accordance with
the Hague Service Convention which often suffers from delay.

G. Consequences of a Failure to Serve in an Authorised Manner
1-88

A defendant is not a party to proceedings until properly served.248 However, the court has
discretion to overlook defects in service, and non-compliance with the rules does not render a proceeding void unless the Court so directs but the Court may set aside a proceeding
in whole or in part as irregular, or amend or deal with it as it sees fit.249 The following cases
provide guidance on the considerations taken into account by the Court in exercising its
discretion. In Davies & Christin v Riley,250 the plaintiff was required by the rules of court to
inform the defendant of the outcome of a hearing at which he was absent. The plaintiff did
not do so but the Greffier did attempt to inform the defendant's advocates who had undertaken to accept service. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant may have been notified
of the hearing but it was not certain and accordingly the rules had not been complied with
and the order was set aside. In Anagram v Mayo,251 the plaintiff served an Order of Justice
containing an injunction which in terms of the order would become effective immediately
on being served on the defendants' Jersey advocates. The Royal Court held that an application for service-out was required and accordingly service had not been properly effected.
Despite this, the defendants sought further and better particulars of the Order of Justice.
The Royal Court held that although the defendants were not properly served, they were

aware of the proceedings and affected by the service in that it brought into effect interim
injunctions binding on them and were therefore sufficiently made a party for the Court to
exercise its jurisdiction over them. In Virani v Virani,252 an action was effectively served out
of the jurisdiction without leave and the Royal Court dismissed the action as improperly
served even though it had come to the attention of the defendant. In United Capital Corporation Ltd v Bender,253 leave was granted to serve an Order of Justice outwith the jurisdiction and the Royal Court held that it was not served in accordance with the order. However,
the defendant had received full notice of the nature and content of the claim from his advocates in Jersey and had been able to prepare detailed arguments. The Royal Court held that
it has discretion under rule 10/6 RCR 2004 to treat proceedings as void, set aside wholly or
in part, or amend or deal with them as it thinks fit and the defendant would be treated as
having been validly served since there would be no prejudice to him. Proceedings would not
generally be defeated by a mere technicality and the Court would consider the substance
and justice of an individual case. In the event that an order for substituted service is made
on an ex parte basis and the Court subsequently determines that the evidence supporting
that application was deficient, the Court has power to rectify any error in the application
for substituted service, deem service to have been effected and, if appropriate, penalise the
party in default by costs under rule 10/7 RCR 2004. It may, of course, decide not to do so,
declare that a party has not been validly served and require personal service.254

H. Timings for the Exchange of Pleadings
A defendant or respondent who wishes to defend an action placed on the pending list must,
within 21 days of the date on which the action was placed on the pending list, or of the
delivery of the particulars of claim, as the case may be, file an Answer to the action.255 Time
for the filing of an Answer does not begin to run until any challenge to the jurisdiction of
the Royal Court under rule 6/6 RCR 2004 has been dismissed or abandoned.256 The failure
to file an Answer within time gives the plaintiff grounds to apply for an order for judgment
in default.257 The plaintiff is at liberty (but not obliged to) file a reply within 21 days of the
delivery of the Answer.258 Unless the Answer contains a counterclaim, which, if defended,
will itself will merit an Answer (known as a rejoinder), no subsequent pleading may be filed
except by leave of the Court.259 If the Answer contains a counterclaim, the defendant may,
within 21 days of the delivery of the reply, file a rejoinder.260

IV. Case Management and Directions for Trial

The Royal Court Rules 2004 have no equivalent of the menu of case and cost management
powers found in CPR Part 3, which are instead disbursed throughout the rules and are
reflective of the Court's inherent and unlimited jurisdiction to regulate proceedings before
it. Neither does the Royal Court have a system to allocate proceedings to a particular track
with default directions. For each matter that comes before it, the Royal Court has power to

indicated the wish of the Royal Court to ensure that existing actions progress as quickly as is
reasonably practicable. All parties and their advisors should seek to have actions disposed of
within 12 months of their commencement wherever possible. The Judicial Greffier has been
given instruction to implement appropriate means to achieve these objectives. Rule 6/25(2)
RCR 2004 provides that if three years after an action has been set down it has not been completed the Court may give notice of its intention to dismiss that action. Rule 6/26(13) allows
the Court to consider dismissing an action if a summons for directions has not been issued
within two months of the close of pleadings. The Deputy Judicial Greffier and the Master have
initiated a system whereby, once an action that comes before the Royal Court has been placed
on the pending list, it will be reviewed after six months to ensure that appropriate progress
has been made. If that is not the case then the Court will, of its own volition, institute such
appropriate case management steps as it considers necessary. This could include the use of its
powers under rule 6/26(13) RCR 2004 in respect of any action which has become dormant.

A. Standard Procedure for Directions
The procedure for applying for directions as to how an action on the pending list (ie an
action that has not had judgment in default entered or that has not been struck out or the
subject of an application for summary judgment) should proceed is set out in rule 6/26
RCR 2004. While this procedure is not expressly said to apply to actions commenced by way
of Representation, it, and the model directions to which it relates can be applied mutatis
mutandis to proceedings by Representation as much as proceedings commenced by Order
of Justice. The procedure is as follows:
1.

Within one month after the close of pleadings, the plaintiff must issue a summons for
directions to be heard at least 14 days, and no more than 42 days, thereafter in the form
(or substantially in the form) prescribed in RCR Schedule 3.272 This procedure exists
with a view to providing an occasion for the Court to consider the preparations for trial
so that all matters which must or can be dealt with on interlocutory applications and
have not already been dealt with may so far as possible be dealt with; and such directions may be given as to the future course of the action as appear best adapted to secure
the just, expeditious and economical disposal thereof.
If the plaintiff fails to issue a summons for directions, the defendant or any other party
to the action may do so or apply for an order to dismiss the action.273 However, on an
application by a party to dismiss the action the Court may either dismiss the action
on such terms as it considers just or deal with the application as if it were a summons
for directions.274 In deciding whether to dismiss the Court will consider the following
matters (not sequentially or disjunctively):275
i.
Has the plaintiff otherwise prosecuted the action with reasonable diligence or are
there examples of other significant failures to progress the claim expeditiously?

Is the plaintiff 's failure to issue a summons for directions otherwise excusable?
Is it just for the plaintiff to be allowed to continue the action?

Any party to whom the summons for directions is addressed must apply at the hearing
of the summons for any order or directions which that party desires (and is capable of
being dealt with on an interlocutory application) and must, not less than seven days
before the hearing of the summons, serve on the other parties a notice specifying those
orders and directions in so far as they differ from the orders and directions asked for
by the summons.276
If two months have elapsed from the time limited for filing pleadings and no summons
has been issued pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this rule, the Court may
of its own motion, after giving not less than 28 days' notice in writing to all parties to
the action, order that the action be dismissed, and the Court may make such consequential order as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.277 A person who was a party to
an action dismissed pursuant to paragraph (13) may apply to the Court for the action
to be reinstated.278
On the hearing of a summons for directions, the Court shall consider whether:
i.
it is possible to deal then with all matters which must or can be considered on the
hearing of the summons for directions; or
ii. it is expedient to adjourn the consideration of all or any of those matters.
On the rare occasions, when the summons for directions first comes to be heard, the
Court considers that it is possible to deal with all the said matters, it shall deal with
them forthwith and shall endeavour to secure that all other matters which must or can
be dealt with on interlocutory applications and have not already been dealt with are
also dealt with there and then.
If, as is more usual, the Court considers that it is expedient to adjourn consideration of
all or any of the matters which must be considered at the directions hearing, the Court
will deal forthwith with such of those matters as it considers can conveniently be dealt
with and will endeavour to secure that all other matters which must or can be dealt
with are dealt with at a resumed hearing of the summons for directions or by agreement between the parties.
At the directions hearing, the Court will endeavour to secure that the parties make all
admissions and all agreements as to the conduct of the proceedings which ought reasonably to be made by them and may record in its act any admissions or agreements so
made, and any refusal to make any admission or agreement.279
The Court may at any directions hearing require a party or that party's advocate or
solicitor to give any information or produce any document. Where such information
or document are not given or produced, the Court may (1) record the facts in its act
with a view to such order, if any, as to costs as may be just being made at the trial; or
(2) order that the whole or any part of the pleadings of the party concerned be struck

276 RCR 2004, r 6/26(11) provides a mechanism for a party that fails to apply for the orders it seeks in the first
directions hearing, to apply at a subsequent hearing if there has been an adjournment.

the Court to be just.280
The Court will usually direct, as per the model set of directions in Schedule RCR 2004, that
the action be placed on the hearing list and will usually direct a date by which an application must be made for a date for a final hearing. In any event, any party may apply by way
of summons to the Bailiff in chambers for a date to be fixed for a hearing of the action.281

B. Applications to Amend Proceedings Once Served
Once served, a party may amend his pleadings at any point but may only do so with the
leave of the Court on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just, or the consent of
the other parties to the litigation.282 Applications to amend are made by summons to the
Judicial Greffier with an affidavit and skeleton argument in support enclosing a copy of the
draft proceedings showing the proposed amendments in coloured ink.283 The principles
upon which an amendment will be granted are as follows:284
1.
2.

3.

4.

6.

Whether to allow an amendment is, in all cases, a matter of the Court's discretion.285
It is desirable that all relevant matters in dispute between parties should be resolved
and leave to amend should therefore be granted if there would be no prejudice to the
other party which could not be compensated for by an award of costs.286
A party should be given leave to amend its pleadings provided that (1) it seeks to do so
in good faith; and (2) there has been no oversight on its part sufficient to justify leave
being denied.287
An amendment should not be permitted if it would infringe the rules of pleading or
introduce a claim so hopeless that it would be liable to be struck out.288
Amendments that plead a new cause of action should be refused if the cause of action is
arguably prescribed unless new claim arises from substantially same facts as original289
There is a heavy duty on an applicant for a late amendment to show:290
i.
why the matters now sought to be pleaded were not pleaded before;291
ii. what is the strength of the new case;
iii. why an adjournment arising from the amendment (to allow the other parties to
plead in response) should be granted, if one is necessary;

280 RCR 2004, r 6/29(9) preserves a party's absolute defence to the production of documents protected by legal
privilege and no sanction may be applied where such a defence is legitimately relied upon.

V. Litigation Costs
1-95

1-96

1-97

A whole text could be written on the subject of litigation costs alone. For the purposes of this
section of this particular text we are concerned only with the landscape of Jersey's regime
for the taxation (assessment) of costs. This section includes rules relating to the recoverability and assessment of a trustee's costs in proceedings before the Royal Court but the
substantive law on the entitlement of trustees to an indemnity for their litigation costs as a
matter internal to the trust is a discrete and separate topic and is dealt with elsewhere.293 As
with many aspects of its civil procedure, as regards litigation costs, Jersey broadly adheres
to principles which will be familiar to practitioners familiar with the English position prior
to the enactment of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998.
The legal costs incurred by a party involved in proceedings before the Royal Court usually
comprise one or more of (1) advocate's fees; (2) court fees and (3) allowable disbursements
(such as independent counsel or experts). The client is responsible to his advocate for his
legal costs (this is largely governed by the retainer), but, if involved in proceedings, a party
may seek an order of the Royal Court to recover some of those costs from the other party.
The power to award costs is derived from Article 2(1) of the Civil Proceedings (Jersey) Law
1956. This gives the Court (in this instance meaning the Bailiff (or any Commissioner)
sitting alone without Jurats) power to order a party to pay another party's costs 'of and
incidental to all proceedings'. The recovery of costs in trust litigation before the Royal Court
is governed by Article 53 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Part 12 of the Royal Court Rules
2004 and the accompanying practice directions.294 Jersey adheres to the indemnity principle, which is to say that whatever the basis of taxation, the receiving cannot recover more
from the other party than he has expended to pay his own advocates.295
The Royal Court has expressed itself on innumerable occasions, that it is desirable to ensure
the costs of legal proceedings are kept in proportion to the matter in dispute. Any consideration of Part 12 should have this objective in mind. That being said, Jersey has not yet

embarked down the path, as has been done in England and Wales, of a formal process of
cost management and control throughout the proceedings as a discrete component of the
Court's case management powers.296

A. Costs Incidental to the Proceedings
'Costs incidental to all proceedings' has been explained as being all costs necessary and reasonable to conduct of proceedings in Jersey, including matters relevant to parallel foreign
proceedings, if not recovered abroad.297 The illustrative list of attendances, items of work,
suggested in the PD RC 09/01,298 may arise out of or be incidental to the proceedings.

1-98

i. Recovering the Cost of Foreign Lawyers
Provided it is reasonable to instruct English lawyers concerning Jersey litigation, the proportionate costs of doing so will be allowed as a cost incidental to the proceedings.299 This
is recognised particularly in complex trust litigation where the assistance and advice of specialist Chancery counsel has been recognised to be appropriate.300 The implication being
that where the matter is, in the Court's view, within the competence of Jersey advocates then
then the cost of instructing English lawyers will not be reasonably incurred and allowable as
a disbursement.301 Further, an English lawyer's bill of costs must contain sufficient detail to
be properly considered by the paying party and the Greffier may require more detail before
taxing those costs.302

1-99

ii. Recovering an After the Event Insurance (ATE) Premium
An order that a party pay 'the costs of the action on the standard basis' was narrower in
meaning than the power conferred by Article 2(1) of the 1956 Law.303 In the case it was
decided that the ATE premium was not part of the 'costs of the action' as it was not sustained
as a result of work done or disbursements incurred in the furtherance of the action.304 Further, although it was not necessary to decide the matter, an ATE insurance premium could
not be regarded as a cost 'incidental to' the proceedings. Moreover, the recovery of the premium did not satisfy the 'necessity' test required for the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction

of the Court. The implication from Riley is, therefore, that without statutory intervention,
an ATE premium is not currently a recoverable item of cost in Jersey litigation.

B. The Court's Discretion as to Costs
1-101

1-102

The award of costs is at the discretion of the Court. The relevant principles in relation to
awards of costs are:305
1. whether to award costs, in what amount and on what basis are at the discretion of the
Court;
costs should follow the event unless the Court believed the circumstances required some
other action;
that general rule did not cease to apply simply because the successful party unsuccessfully raised issues or made allegations, but where this had caused a significant increase
in the length or cost of the proceedings he might be deprived of the whole or part of his
costs; and
where the successful party raised issues or made allegations improperly or unreasonably,
the Court could not only deprive him of his costs but might order him to pay the whole
or a part of the unsuccessful party's costs.
As a general rule, the successful party in litigation will normally be awarded their costs.
However, the Court has wide discretion and can order otherwise. The principle that costs
follow the event is not sacrosanct and the Court has discretion to make different cost orders
to reflect the outcome of different issues in the litigation making a strict winner takes all
approach in the litigation, overall, inappropriate.306 The practice in England in the recent
past has been a move away from issue-based orders to a percentage or proportion-based
orders in an effort to curtail the practical difficulties (and necessary extra costs incurred)
in a detailed taxation of having to examine each item claimed in a bill of costs through the
prism of the issues in the case.307 The Court may deprive even a successful party of some
or all of its costs if an increase in the length of the proceedings were caused by that party
raising unsuccessful issues improperly or unreasonably.308

C. Common Costs Orders

which may make any order it chooses under its discretion as to costs.

whatever other costs orders are made in the proceedings.309

Costs in the cause/Costs

The party in whose favour the Court makes an order for costs at
the end of the proceedings is entitled to his costs of the part of the
proceedings to which the order relates.310

The Court postpones taking its decision about these costs to a later
occasion. If it does not make a later order, the costs will be costs in

application

If the party in whose favour the costs order is made is awarded costs
at the end of the proceedings, that party is entitled to his costs of the
part of the proceedings to which the order relates. If any other party
is awarded costs at the end of the proceedings, the party in whose
favour the costs order is made is not liable to pay the costs of any
other party in respect of the part of the proceedings to which the
order relates.
Again, this cost order is self-contained and should not be upset,
whatever other costs orders are made in the proceedings.

Costs thrown away

Where, for example, a judgment or order is set aside, or the whole or
part of any proceedings are adjourned, the party in whose favour the
costs order is made is entitled to the costs which have been incurred
as a consequence. This includes the costs of:
(i) Preparing for and attending any hearing at which the judgment
or order which has been set aside was made. (ii) Preparing for and
attending any hearing to set aside the judgment or order in question.
(iii) Preparing for and attending any hearing at which the Court
orders the proceedings or the part in question to be adjourned.
Any steps taken to enforce a judgment or order which has
subsequently been set aside.

Costs of and caused by

Where, for example, the Court makes this order on an application
to amend a statement of case, the party in whose favour the costs
order is made is entitled to the costs of preparing for and attending
the application and the costs of any consequential amendment to his
own statement of case.

(continued)
309 Such orders are to be regarded as self-contained and should not be undermined on assessment. If the Court
wishes to make an order which was affected by the fate of the action, it can do so by ordering costs in the case or
costs reserved. See Arya Holdings Ltd v Minories Fin Ltd [1993 JLR N-5]. See also Business Environment Bow Lane
Limited v Deanwater Estates Limited [2009] EWHC 2014.
310 Taylor v Burnton [2014] EWCA Civ 21 said that such orders, so far as English practice, are now rarely made;
at [43]: 'Whereas in times gone by "costs in cause" orders or "claimants costs in cause" orders where commonly
made on interim applications, nowadays they are more rarely made, and the winner of an interim application will
commonly be awarded his costs there and then, regardless of what happens at the trial'.
311 Note that there is some case law to the effect that an order for costs reserved is similar to costs in the case;
see Catch a Ride Ltd & Anor v Gardner & Ors [2014] EWHC 209 (Ch).

Effect of Order

Costs here and below

The party in whose favour the costs order is made is entitled not only
to his costs in respect of the proceedings in which the Court makes
the order but also to his costs of the proceedings in any lower court.

No order as to costs/Each Each party is to bear his own costs of the part of the proceedings to
party to pay his own costs which the order relates whatever costs order the Court makes at the
end of the proceedings. 'No order for costs' is appropriate when the
Court regards it as unrealistic to identify which of the parties was
overall the successful party.312
Order silent as to costs

Each party is to bear his own costs of the part of the proceedings to
which the order relates.

D. The Basis of Taxation
1-104

Part 12 RCR 2004 provides for the basis for taxation. Costs are taxed on either the standard basis or the indemnity basis. An award on the latter basis is closer to complete recovery. However, on both bases, the Court will not allow costs that have been unreasonably
incurred, or that are unreasonable in amount and neither will it permit recovery in breach
of the indemnity principle.

i. Standard Basis of Taxation
1-105

If costs are ordered to be assessed on the standard basis the Greffier will only allow all
costs to be recovered which are (1) reasonable in amount and (2) reasonably incurred. The
receiving party has the burden of proving the reasonableness and proportionality of the
amount it claims. Any doubt the Greffier may have as to whether the costs were reasonable
incurred and reasonable in amount is resolved in favour of the paying party.313

ii. Indemnity Basis of Taxation
1-106

On a taxation of costs on the indemnity basis all costs sought to be recovered are allowed
except insofar as they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred
and any doubts which the Greffier may have as to whether the costs were reasonably
incurred or were reasonable in amount shall be resolved in favour of the receiving party.314
The accepted interpretation of this direction is that costs are presumed to be reasonable
unless the paying party can prove beyond doubt that they are not. Indemnity costs are
usually ordered only in exceptional circumstances and often have a penal character, being
typically ordered as an expression of the Court's displeasure in compensating one party

f­ollowing another party's wrongful conduct of proceedings.315 The following principles
apply as whether the Court will make an award of costs on the indemnity basis:316
1.
2.

3.

There had to be 'some special or unusual feature in the case' to justify such an award.317
A court may make an indemnity costs order only where there has been some culpability, some abuse of process such as deceit, underhand or unreasonable behaviour, abuse
of court procedures, or the submission of voluminous and unnecessary evidence.318
The Court has rejected a submission that an indemnity costs order should only be considered where the actions of the paying party are malicious or vexatious.319

In respect of an award of costs generally, it is a question of what would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.320 The question specifically in relation to whether the costs
award should be on the indemnity basis will always be whether there is something in the
conduct of the action by one of the parties or the circumstances of the case which takes it
out of the norm in a way that justifies an order for indemnity costs, recognising that there
will usually be some degree of unreasonableness.321 No costs award can offend the indemnity principle; the receiving party can never recover more than they have actually spent in
the course of the proceedings.322 While 100 per cent recovery of costs is rare, the indemnity
basis of assessment can take a party nearer a complete recovery than the standard basis.323
If the Court does not make any order about the basis for assessment, the presumption is for
costs to be assessed on the standard basis.324 It follows, therefore, that indemnity costs have
to be asked for at the time of the order for costs.

1-107

iii. Taxation and Trustee's Costs
An order for costs on the indemnity basis is a separate question from the indemnity in
respect of a trustee's entitlement to recoup reasonable expenses incurred by it on behalf
of the trust from the trust fund. The trustee's entitlement to its indemnity is dealt with in
Chapter 11. As a general rule, a trustee is not to be left personally out of pocket for costs reasonably incurred on behalf of the trust and the trustee has a right to fully indemnify itself

315 The examples of indemnity costs awarded to signify the Court's displeasure are innumerable. In the context of trust litigation the following are an illustrative collection: (breach of fiduciary duty by a trustee) In Re
MacKinnon [2009 JLR 387]; (contempt of court by breach of an injunction) Play Ltd v Legato Assets Ltd [2006 JLR
N30]; (unreasonable refusal by trustee to disclose documents to a beneficiary) Hogg v Williamson [2003 JLR N38];
(unreasonable failure to engage in mediation) Café de Lecq Ltd v RA Rossborough (Insurance Brokers) Ltd [2012 (2)
JLR 115]; (material non-disclosure leading to setting aside an injunction) Manley v Bell [2007 JLR N20].
316 Leeds United Football Club Limited v Weston and Another [2012] JCA 088.
317 Dixon v Jefferson Seal Ltd [1998 JLR 47].

321 Dalemont Ltd v Senatorov (n 167) applying C v P-S (n 319).
322 Boyd v Pickersgill & Le Cornu (n 295).
323 In practice, the award of indemnity costs in Jersey usually results in a taxed recovery of approximately 90%
of the costs claimed; see Marange Investments (Proprietary) Ltd v La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines SARL
[2013] JRC119A at [53] per Clyde-Smith.
324 RCR 2004, r 12/3(3).

from the trust assets for such costs. Such costs may include the cost of litigation. Article 53
of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 regulates the Court's power to order the costs and expenses
of and incidental to an application to the Court to be raised and paid out of the trust property or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as the court thinks fit.
Where the trustee maintains a neutral position in non-hostile proceedings for the proper
construction and administration of the trust, the trustee is usually entitled to a full indemnity from the trust assets for all costs reasonably incurred with no express order for costs
or costs on the indemnity basis being required.325 On the occasion that the Court orders
that other parties, such as beneficiaries, to proceedings are entitled to their costs from the
trust fund, those costs must be the subject of taxation.326 It follows that where the trustee is
neutral in litigation, on a taxation (ie quantification) of a trustee's costs and expenses, the
Greffier should not apply the indemnity basis under rule 12/5 RCR 2004, which procedure
was specifically designed for taxation of awards of costs in hostile litigation, nor should the
Greffier embark on an assessment of the Factor A and Factor B rates.327 As guidance to the
Greffier the Court in Alhamrani set down the following principles:
1.
2.

3.

4.
1-109

the scales applicable on a normal taxation were not relevant to a taxation of a neutral
trustee's entitlement to recover his costs and expenses from the trust fund;
a trustee's duty included an obligation to consider whether the charges of a particular
lawyer or firm of lawyers were appropriate both to the nature of the problem and the
size of the trust fund;
when considering legal costs, the Greffier should concentrate on whether a particular
matter was one upon which it was reasonable to spend time and whether the degree of
time spent was reasonable; and
the test was not whether the Greffier considered that the costs were incurred at the correct level, but whether they were reasonably incurred.

It follows that a beneficiary does not have an automatic right to seek the taxation of the costs
and expenses of a neutral trustee.328 However a beneficiary may invoke the statutory and
supervisory jurisdiction of the Court in respect of the costs and expenses of a neutral trustee
by raising a complaint, question or doubt about the reasonableness of those costs which cannot be struck out or seen as obviously bad on their face. A trustee does not have carte blanche
to use the trust fund for the payment of legal, professional or other fees, costs or expenses in
an unreasonable, improper, immoderate or disproportionate way. Where costs or expenses
were not reasonably incurred or the trustee acted in breach of trust or duty, the Court has a
discretion to override the principle that a trustee is entitled to a full indemnity by ordering

325 In re Internine Trust (n 300); Alhamrani v J.P. Morgan Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd [2007 JLR 527]. See trustee's
statutory right of indemnity under the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 26(2).
326 Trilogy Management Limited v YT Charitable Foundation (International) Limited [2012 (2) JLR 330]. Note
also that in contrast to the trustee's right to a full indemnity, taxation on that basis in respect of other parties would
not necessarily result in full reimbursement.
327 See Alhamrani v J.P. Morgan Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd (n 325), where the application of Factor A and Factor B
in a detailed taxation of a trustee's costs and expenses under RCR 2004 r 12/3(1)(b) was disapplied as being inappropriate. As to the trustee's right of indemnity generally in respect of the costs of litigation on behalf of the trust,
see Ch 11.

that the neutral trustee was not entitled to recover its costs.329 Once such a complaint, question or doubt is properly raised by a beneficiary, the Court will decide how it should best be
resolved. The procedures to be employed must necessarily be flexible. Normally, questions as
to the reasonableness of a particular expense or of the amounts charged can be expected to
be resolved by the Greffier but that procedure is not a taxation of the trustee's costs properly
so called.330 A question as to an alleged breach of trust can be expected to require determination by the Court itself. Even in a taxation or an assessment of reasonableness by a Greffier,
he is to be at liberty to refer any point of principle, difficulty or importance to the Court,
should that seem appropriate, or the Court may, on application by any of the parties, order
that a particular point be resolved by the Court rather than the Greffier.

iv. Orders for an Interim Payment of Costs on Account
The Court has an inherent power to order an interim payment of costs on account before
taxation in order to enable a party to obtain a money award in costs as soon as possible. Under Article 16 of the Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961, a concurrent jurisdiction
exists to order interim costs on account before the Court of Appeal.331 Orders for costs
on account are a rough and ready affair and the Court will not descend into conducting
a taxation or detailed review of the successful party's costs. The amount of costs ordered
on account is usually 50 per cent of the headline figure claimed.332 The recent authorities
have emphasised that an immediate payment of costs on account should be a percentage
of the amount the receiving party is likely to recover on taxation calculated on a conservative basis to avoid any real risk of over-payment.333 If costs are awarded on the indemnity
basis, the determination of the amount of the interim payment on account is usually based
on the lawyers' charge out fees.334 On an application for costs on account on the standard
basis, court and the paying party should be supplied with a summary of the costs sought
setting out the fixed Factor A rates claimed and an appropriate percentage Factor B 'uplift'
to the time of the fee earners, in addition to the disbursements. The Jersey Court of Appeal
in Crociani rejected the submission that a costs summary in this format did not allow any
useful response to be made by the paying party.335

to be paid will be determined by the Greffier who is responsible for the taxation (assessment) of costs if an amount cannot be agreed between the parties. Once an order for costs
has been granted, steps are usually taken to seek settlement of the receiving party's costs on
an inter-parties, without prejudice save as to costs, basis. The taxation process is regarded
as a process of last resort.
The commencement of taxation is the responsibility, in the first instance, of the receiving
party who has three months (two months in the case of orders relating to an interlocutory
matter not already summarily taxed by the Greffier) to commence taxation of costs relating
to the determination in the main proceedings.336 Within seven days of commencing taxation proceedings the receiving party must notify the paying party who has 28 days in which
to respond and file objection to the receiving party's bill of costs. The receiving party then
has a further 21 days within which to file replies to those objections before the Greffier will
commence taxation.337 If taxation proceedings are not commenced by the receiving party
within the prescribed period, the paying party may instead commence proceedings, on such
terms as the Greffier deems appropriate. In doing so the paying party is entitled to their
costs. If the paying party fails to submit objections within the 28 days allowed under RCR
r 12/11(1), they are deemed to have no objections to the bill and the Greffier will proceed
to tax the bill. After the expiration of 14 days following the receipt of the receiving party's
replies or following the date on which replies were due (it may be that the receiving party
does not file replies), the Greffier will proceed to tax the bill of costs unless either a hearing
is required or the bill has been provisionally taxed.338
In taxing costs the Greffier is bound by the terms of the costs order and cannot make contradictory decisions in the assessment.339 The Royal Court has a discretion to summarily
fix costs rather than submit them to the Greffier for taxation if it considers it fair to do so
in the circumstances of the case and there is sufficient evidence available in order for it to
summarily fix costs, which are likely to be less than would be recovered if submitted for
taxation.340 The Court may also fix costs and not submit them to taxation in cases of misconduct during the course of the litigation.341 Royal Court Rules 12/10-12/12 set out the
procedure by which taxation proceedings before the Greffier are commenced. The rules are
supplemented by three practice directions:

i. Standard Basis Taxation Procedure
The amount of costs to be allowed on taxation (whether on the standard or indemnity
basis) is (subject to any Rule or Order of the Court fixing the costs to be allowed) at the discretion of the Greffier. In exercising his discretion with regard to the total sum of costs to be
awarded, the Greffier must have regard to all the relevant circumstances, and in particular
to the following factors:342
1.

1-114

the complexity of the item of cost or of the cause or matter in which it arises and the
difficulty or novelty of the questions involved;
the skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility required of, and the time and labour
expended by, the solicitor or advocate;
the number and importance of the documents (however brief) prepared or perused;
the place and circumstances in which the business involved is transacted;
the importance of the cause or matter to the client;
where money or property is involved, its amount or value; and
any other fees and allowances payable to the solicitor or advocate in respect of other
items in the same cause or matter, but only where work done in relation to those items
has reduced the work which would otherwise have been necessary in relation to the
item in question.

The final taxed figure in a standard taxation of a bill of costs is the product of adding
together (1) a direct cost component ('Factor A') and (2) a component for care and conduct
('Factor B'). Factor A is intended to cover the salary and the appropriate share of the general overheads of each fee earner. The particular elements that are found to constitute the
average direct costs of that category of average fee earner and the methodology employed
therein are determined by the Superior Number with the advice and assistance of a committee specially constituted for that purpose.343 The Factor A rate does not correspond to
the actual billed costs of the receiving party, which represent the maximum the receiving
party can be awarded, and in fact the Factor A rate is likely to fall some way below the actual
billed rate. Factor B is intended to reflect all the relevant circumstances of the case and in
particular the matters set out in PD RC 09/01. The Factor B uplift is intended to reflect
those imponderable factors, for example general supervision of subordinate staff, for which
no direct time charge can be substantiated, and the element of commercial profit. Accordingly, the allowances to be made for different items may, in the discretion of the Greffier, be
allowed at different rates. In particular, it is anticipated that, save in unusual circumstances,
the rate appropriate to Items 1, 2 and 5 for care and conduct will be less than the rate appropriate to paragraphs Items 3 and 4 for general care and conduct.
The relationship between the Factor A rate and the Factor B uplift in a standard taxation is
as follows. The application of the Factor A rate alone is likely to lead to a shortfall between
the allowable hourly rate for particular grades of fee earner and their actual billed rate. This

342

divergence becomes particularly acute the more senior (and commensurately expensive)
the fee earner. Conversely, for those areas of work to which the Factor B uplift is routinely
applied, the more senior the fee earner, the more 'value', relative to those more junior fee
earners, the fee earner is likely to bring to those more imponderable aspects of the litigation.
The Factor B uplift on top of the Factor A rate therefore leads to an increase in the overall
recoverable amount. The Factor B uplift is designed to ensure an efficient distribution of
billable work to the appropriate grade of fee earner. However the impact of the Factor B
uplift may in some instances lead to a result whereby the recoverable amount for the purposes of taxation exceeds the amount actually billed. In order to ensure there is no breach
of the indemnity principle, the recoverable amount must be capped at the actual amount
billed, notwithstanding that the strict application of the Factor B uplift would entitle the
receiving party to more.
The recoverable costs incidental to all proceedings will be comprised of individual items
of costs falling within Part A, Part B or Part C below.344 Each item in Part A (other than
an item relating only to time spent in travelling and waiting) may include an allowance for
general care and conduct having regard to such of the circumstances referred to above as
may be relevant to that item.345

a. Format of a Bill of Costs
A bill of costs submitted for taxation should be in either Form 1 or Form 2.346 In practice,
Form 2 is designed for a straightforward bill of costs such as those following an interlocutory matter. Form 1 should be used in more complex, lengthy pieces of litigation where
itemised lists of individual items of cost become unwieldy. The format of a bill of costs and
its appropriateness for a particular piece of litigation will often be determined by a professional tax draftsman.

1-118

Form 1
Where Form 1 is used the bill should commence with a headnote that mirrors the headnote
of the pleadings. Pending or Sine die numbers should be shown, where applicable, and the
names of the legal practices representing each party, who are parties entitled to be heard at
these taxation proceedings, should also be included. This should be followed by the details
of the receiving and paying parties and the Act of Court under which the bill of costs is
drawn. The first entry under the headnote should contain a brief narrative setting out the
factors on which the receiving party relies in support of care and conduct (ie the 'Factor B'
uplift) claimed in his bill if that claimed is above the base Factor 'B' percentage (as to the

346 Annexed by way of illustration only. A costs draftsperson will assist in compiling a bill of costs in the appropriate format. The costs of the draftsperson is itself a recoverable cost as part of the taxation exercise provided it
is reasonable and proportionate to have used one, which in the majority of trust litigation of any complexity, it
will be.

guidance on which see below). All unusual or exceptional factors should be identified. If,
Form 2, is adopted, this statement in support of Factor B should be in greater detail and
listed by area. The second entry under the headnote should set out the status of the fee
earners concerned and the expense rates ie 'Factor A' claimed for each.347 The third entry
under the headnote should set out the care and conduct rates, ie 'Factor B' claimed for the
following key events in the litigation:

Item 2:
Item 3:

Item 5:

Interlocutory attendances348
Conferences
Attendances at Trial or Hearing349
Preparation
Taxation of Costs350

The bill should then set out in chronological order all the relevant events that constitute a
chargeable item and the amount claimed should be shown against it. Where any event has
occasioned a disbursement, the amount claimed for that disbursement should be shown. All
chargeable items and disbursements inserted within the bill should be numbered consecutively. This number should be set out in a separate column located on the far left hand side
of the bill. Finally, every bill shall be signed by the advocate or Jersey solicitor submitting the
bill prior to lodging for taxation. The signature implies that the bill has been checked by an
appropriately qualified person, the bill is complete, and accepts responsibility for the factual
accuracy of the bill. For bills of costs set out in Form 1, Interlocutory Attendances, Conferences and Attendance at Trial or Hearing should show separately under those headings the
time engaged and the allowances claimed for care and conduct and for the time engaged in
traveling and waiting. Also the general work of preparation is to be placed after all the other
items save only costs in respect of taxation which is to be the last item.
For bills of costs set out in Form 1, costs claimed for preparation should be divided into
three parts: A, B and C:
1. Part A Set out the work done and the amount claimed for it in the following separate
sections:
i. Attendance on and correspondence with the plaintiff
ii. Attendance on and correspondence witness
iii. The Greffier
iv. The Defendant's advocate
v. Documents
vi. Authorities
vii. Court bundle
viii. Hearing preparation

347 The maximum prescribed rates that can be claimed under Factor A are set down in practice directions periodically updated by the Superior Number of the Royal Court.
348 ie attending the hearing of any summons or other application at Court, in chambers, the Judicial Greffe or
elsewhere.
349 ie attending the trial or hearing of a cause or matter, or an appeal or to hear a deferred judgment.
350 ie preparing the bill, responding to notified objections or questions and, if applicable, preparing for and
attending the taxation.

Litigation Costs

57

Each section or sub-section should contain a breakdown of the work comprised in it and
should have its separate subtotal. At the foot of the last of these sections there should be
shown a total Part A figure.
Part B Set out the amount claimed for general care and conduct on the basis of the guidance351 as a separate monetary amount which should also be expressed as a percentage of
the total Part A figure. This part should include a statement identifying those factors in PD
RC 09/01, paragraph 2 (above) which are relied on in relation to the assessment of the claim
for general care and conduct.
Part C In this part, an amount should be claimed for time engaged in travelling and waiting
without the Factor B uplift in connection with the work comprised in Part A only. Details
should be given showing to which part of that work the claim or claims relate. The section
subtotals and the totals of Parts A, B and C figures referred to above should be shown in the
narrative column of the bill. The aggregate of those figures should be shown in the costs
column.

1-122

Form 2
Bills of Costs set out in Form 2 should show separately (1) the time claimed; (2) the status

b. Specific Matters of Taxation

Letters (including facsimile and email) and telephone calls will in general be allowed on
a unit basis of six minutes (ie 1 unit) each, the charge being calculated by reference to the
appropriate expense rate. The unit charge for letters will include perusing and considering
the relevant letters in and no separate charge should be made for incoming letters. The
Greffier may allow an actual time charge for letters of substance and for telephone calls
which properly amount to an attendance, providing details of the work done are provided
and the date and time taken has been recorded.

Time Sheets
1-127

Properly kept, detailed and contemporaneous time records are helpful in support of a bill
provided they explain the nature of the work as well as recording the time involved. However, they cannot be accepted as conclusive evidence that the time recorded either has been
spent or if spent, is 'reasonably' chargeable.
Statements of Accounts

1-128

Accounts should accompany the bill of costs for all payments claimed (other than court fees
or minor out of pocket disbursements) and should, when appropriate, be accompanied by
details showing the work done, the time spent, by whom and when, and the computation
of the charge. This should include details of all accounts, both sent and pending, to be paid
by their client.
Bills of Costs of Foreign Lawyers

1-129

Bills of costs submitted by lawyers outside the jurisdiction (including counsel) should
include within the bill sufficient detail to enable the paying party to properly consider
that claimed.352 In this regard, counsel's fees should be broken down identifying the work
undertaken and the corresponding cost. In appropriate cases the Greffier may request further information.
Travelling Expenses

1-130

Where travelling expenses are claimed they should be shown as a disbursement and details
supplied. Local travelling expenses will not be allowed.
The Cost of Communications

1-131

The cost of postage, couriers, outgoing telephone calls, fax and telex messages is in general
part of the lawyer's normal overhead expense and should already be factored in as part of
the Factor A component of the bill of costs. The Greffier has a discretion to allow such a
disbursement in unusual circumstances or where the cost is unusually heavy. In these circumstances the lawyer must show that this cost could not reasonably be supposed to have
been taken into account when the expense rate was ascertained.
Copies of Documents

1-132

The making of copies of documents is part of the lawyer's normal overhead expense. The
Greffier may in his discretion make an allowance for copying in unusual circumstances or
when the documents copied are unusually numerous in relation to the nature of the case.
Where this discretion is invoked the number of copies made, their purpose, and the charge
claimed should be set out in the bill. If copies have been made out of the office the cost

352

Litigation Costs

59

should be shown as a disbursement. If made in the office, a charge equivalent to the commercial cost should be claimed. A charge based on the time expended by a member of the
lawyer's staff will not be allowed.
No details of the work done need be provided for preparing the bill of costs, responding to
notified objections or questions and, if applicable, preparing for and attending the taxation;
but on taxation the party entitled to the costs must justify the amount claimed.353

1-133

c. Documents in Support of Taxation
Proceedings for the taxation of costs should commence by writing to the Judicial Greffier and filing the following requisite documents at the Judicial Greffe, as required by RCR
12/10:
1.
2.

a copy of the Act of Court containing the relevant costs order;
if more than one bill is to be submitted a statement of the name of every party entitled
to submit a bill in the taxation proceedings;
a statement providing the names of all the parties who are entitled to be heard in the
taxation proceedings;
a bill of costs in either form to be found in the Appendices, as specified in Practice
Direction 09/01, signed by the advocate dealing with the matter; and
all documents required to support each item contained within the bill to be assessed.354

3.
4.
5.

The following supporting documentation should be compiled and either submitted at the
same time or made available upon the Greffier's request:
1.

work done under 'Preparation', in the above table under Part A (9),(10),(11) and (12)
(if using Form 1) or in the case of a bill of costs set out in Form 2, should include within
the bill the following information:
i.
the date when the work was done;
ii. a description of the work;
iii. the status of the fee earner who did the work; and
iv. how long the work took;
a copy of the indexes to Court bundles relied on by both sides. If an agreed bundle was
submitted this should be noted;
copies of accounts referred to above;355
copies of documents in support of disbursements referred to under travelling expenses
and the cost of communications above;356
if bills of costs by lawyers outside the jurisdiction are claimed, full documentation in
support as required (see above);357
office time records as referred to above.;358

The Greffier may request that the receiving party submit their office files to assist with taxation. If this request is made, it is the responsibility of the lawyer submitting the office files to
ensure that everything necessary to justify the bill of costs is included. In particular, the lawyer may wish to identify specifically documents referred to in the bill of costs or on which
he relies in support of the sum claimed for care and conduct. The files should be delivered
to the Judicial Greffe within seven days after receiving notice of the same, unless in all the
circumstances of the matter a longer time period has been allowed.
d. Guidance on Factor B Uplift

1-136

PD RC 09/01 paragraph 2 set out the basis for the determination of Factor B in civil cases.
The Greffier should have regard to (1) all the circumstances of the case; (2) those particular
matters set out in RC 09/01;359 and (3) the submissions of both sides on taxation, setting
out their contentions in support of or in opposition to the Factor B claimed in the receiving
party's bill of costs. The specified format for the layout of the bill of costs provides that the
bill should contain up to five items, namely:

A Factor B rate is determined for each item in the bill as a percentage of the Factor A total
cost incurred. The Factor B uplift was a feature of taxation of costs in England and Wales
for many years prior to the CPR.360 As Jersey has adopted many of the principles and practices found under the English system of taxation, the determination of Factor B, case law
on taxation matters under the English system may offer some assistance in identifying an
appropriate Factor B uplift for a particular set of facts in Jersey. The actual Factor B allowable on taxation will, of course, flow from the exercise of judicial discretion on the facts of
the particular case.

1-138

The following cases are listed in PD RC 09/01 in the guidance to Factor B and may assist the
legal practitioner in arriving at an appropriate Factor B, although they are now of considerable vintage and no longer reflect the approach to costs in the jurisdiction in which they
were originally decided.
1.

In respect of Item 1, 2 and 5 (Interlocutory attendances, Conferences and Taxation
respectively) the starting norm is a 35 per cent uplift. This starting refers to a 'run of
the mill' straightforward action.361 This figure will increase above 35 per cent so as to
reflect all the circumstances of the case that take it out of the ordinary category. While
35 per cent may have been the starting point, Brooke J, allowed 50 per cent for one

element of interlocutory work. Many actions concerning trusts will contain issues of
specific or technical difficulty, the assessment of volumes of documents and consideration of issues of law. Whether a particular case is different in kind from the category
of cases that can be termed straightforward will depend on the facts of each case. The
party drawing the bill of costs should set out those matters in support when claiming
above the starting point of 35 per cent.
In respect of Item 3 (Attendances at Trial or Hearing) it is to be noted that the separate
functions of counsel and a solicitor do not exist in Jersey which operates a fused profession. A Jersey advocate has an all-embracing role encompassing the work of both solicitor and counsel. In recognition of this role and the additional responsibility thereof, for
'Attendance at trial or Hearing', this is assessed on the same basis as preparation (Item
4), ie an uplift of upward of 50 per cent.
In respect of Item 4 (Preparation) the starting point for 'run of the mill' cases the
uplift starts at 50 per cent with the uplift rising above 50 per cent to reflect a number
of possible factors including the complexity of the case, the particular need for special
attention by the lawyer with conduct and any additional responsibilities which a solicitor may have undertaking towards the client and others.362That particular case was a
personal injury action but the dicta of the decision is not limited to such actions. It
was said that only a small percentage of personal injury cases results in an allowance
over 70 per cent. As one gets higher and higher above 75 per cent, more and more it
should be said that a case should be approaching the exceptional.363 To justify an uplift
of 100 per cent or even one closely approaching 100 per cent there must be some factor or combination of factors which mean that the case approaches the exceptional. A
figure above 100 per cent would seem to be appropriate only when the individual case,
or cases of the particular kind, can properly be regarded as exceptional, and such cases
will be rare.364 A heavy 'test' case that seeks to establish or develop a new point of legal
principle may justify a higher Factor B uplift.365 In Re a company K1989 (C No 4081),366
a commercial case in the Chancery Division concerning an action and counterclaim
seeking relief against trustees, indemnity costs were awarded. 60 per cent Factor B was
claimed. The decision in Johnson above suggested an uplift starting at 50 per cent as
being appropriate for ordinary cases. Lindsay J upheld the 60 per cent claimed and said:

2.

3.

until 14th March, 1991, this case required less attention than would have 'an ordinary case'. The
trustees needed to collect no evidence. They had no case to prove or disapprove. They had to make
discovery but there was nothing exceptional about that. On the other hand, the sheer bulk of the
documents, 80 files as it became, would have introduced its own difficulties and anxieties.

Lindsay J noted that he had a small doubt about the unreasonableness of the uplift claimed,
but as this was an award of indemnity costs those doubts were resolved in favour of the
paying party.

ii. Indemnity Basis Procedure for Taxation
1-139

A bill of costs on the indemnity basis should be set out in the form annexed to PD 09/01
and should consist of such items as are specified in paragraph 3 of PD RC 09/01 as appropriate.367 Taxation on the indemnity basis does not require the separation into Factor A
and Factor B rates, it is sufficient that the bill specify the hourly rate claimed for each fee
earner.368

iii. Summary Assessment in Interlocutory Applications
1-140

If an interlocutory hearing before the Greffier lasts a day or less, after making an award of
costs of the subject of the hearing, the Greffier will consider whether to tax the costs so
ordered by way of summary assessment at the end of that hearing. If the Greffier so decides,
PD 09/03 applies. Each party who seeks an order for costs must prepare a written statement
of the costs (following as closely as possible the format specified in Appendix A to PD RC
09/01 and signed by the party or his legal representative) showing separately in the form of
a schedule:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

1-141

1-142

the number of hours to be claimed;
the hourly rate to be claimed;
the grade of fee earner;
the amount and nature of any disbursement to be claimed; and
any claim for a Factor B uplift.

The statement of costs must be filed with the Greffier and copies served on any party against
whom the order for costs is sought. The statement of costs should be filed and served at
least 24 hours before the date fixed for the interlocutory hearing. The Greffier will take into
account a party's failure to comply with these requirements in making an order for costs,
which may impact the costs of any further hearing or detailed assessment that may be necessary as a result of the failure to comply. The Greffier may tax either on the standard or
indemnity basis on a summary assessment.
The Royal Court has power to make a summary award of costs, although such an order is
unusual. The Court may be persuaded to make a summary assessment where the scope of
the work is limited and the Court could make an informed and confident judgment as to
costs as set out in the bill of costs.369

iv. Interlocutory Applications Disposed of by Consent
Where the parties agree an order by consent without a hearing, where one party is to pay
another party's costs, the parties should agree a figure for costs to be inserted in the consent order. Alternatively, the consent order should specify if costs are to be 'in the cause' or

63

there is to be 'no order as to costs'.370 If the parties cannot agree the costs position then they
should arrange to appear before the Greffier for him to assess costs. Unless good reason can
be shown for the failure to agree an order and the amount of costs, no costs will be allowed
for that appearance.

v. Costs of Taxation
The usual rule is that the receiving party is entitled to its costs of the taxation proceedings.
If it appears to the Greffier that, having regard to all the circumstances of the taxation proceedings, some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs of those
proceedings, the Greffier has, in relation to the costs of the taxation proceedings only, the
same powers as the Court has in relation to costs.371 Once a bill of costs has been taxed the
Greffier will request Court stamps in settlement of his fees charged at a rate of £60 per half
hour.372

1-143

vi. Appealing Costs Decisions
Appeals of costs orders are circumscribed by the fact that costs orders are discretionary. An
appeal from taxation by the Greffier to the Royal Court is only to be allowed in cases where
(1) there has been a serious procedural irregularity in the conduct of the taxation; (2) the
Greffier has taking into account irrelevant matters or has failed to take into account relevant
ones; or (iii) where the decision is otherwise wrong.373 Appeals from the Royal Court to the
Court of Appeal on a costs decision are rare and the Court of Appeal will not ordinarily
interfere unless the Royal Court has itself considered improper matters or not considered
proper matters, misdirected itself as to the appropriate principles or there has been a change
of circumstances since the Royal Court's decision warranting a different decision.374

This section is dedicated to Jersey's developing jurisprudence and practice in relation to the

A. Maintenance and Champerty
1-146

Maintenance is the improper support of litigation in which the supporter has no legitimate
concern, without just cause or excuse. Maintenance most usually occurs where a third party
funds litigation, though assignments of causes of action, may also 'savour of maintenance'.
Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. It occurs when the maintaining party
pays some or all of the costs of a party in return for a share of the proceeds of the action or
suit.375 The rules prohibiting maintenance and champerty are based on the public interest
in protecting the purity of justice.376 The classic definition of the public policy behind the
rules is that of Lord Denning MR in the English case of Re Trepca Mines:
The reason why the common law condemns champerty is because of the abuses to which it may
give rise. The common law fears that the champertous maintainer might be tempted, for his own
personal gain, to inflame the damages, to suppress evidence, or even to suborn witnesses377

1-147

It is only relatively recently that the Jersey's Royal Court has dealt substantively with the
concept of champerty in the context of the modern practice of third party litigation funding. The outcome of two recent cases, In the Matter of the Valetta Trust378 and Barclays
Wealth Trustees (Jersey) Limited and Barclays Wealth Fund Managers (Jersey) Limited
v Equity Trust (Jersey) Limited and Equity Trust Services Limited379 has been to refine what
sort of arrangement is likely to fall foul of the rules against champerty but to otherwise
affirm that Jersey retains a prohibition on arrangements which provide for a share of
the proceeds of litigation and that such arrangements may be held to be unenforceable on
the grounds of champerty if they are contrary to public policy.380 An assignment of a cause
of action in which proceedings have already been commenced by service of originating
process is unenforceable as champertous.381 Considerable care must be taken to ensure that
a funding agreement falls squarely within the permissible margin afforded to such agreements by the Jersey case law.

B. Funding Arrangements with Lawyers
1-148

A funding arrangement between a party and his lawyers is likely to be held to be champertous and unenforceable under Jersey law on the grounds that such an arrangement gives
rise to an unacceptable conflict of interest between the advocate's duty to the court and
his own interest.382 Contingent fee agreements (under which a lawyer contracts with his
client for a percentage of any proceeds) and conditional fee agreements (under which the

lawyer bears the cost of running the litigation in exchange for their fee plus an additional
­percentage as a success fee) are therefore unenforceable under Jersey law.

C. Third Party Litigation Funding
Third party litigation funding-the practice whereby a stranger to the litigation contracts
with a party to finance all or part of a party's legal costs as the case progresses in exchange
for taking an agreed share of the recovery or settlement proceeds but nothing if the action
fails-is a relatively new phenomenon in Jersey litigation. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of
relevant case law in Jersey that precisely delineates 'safe' funding arrangements from those
that are champertous. Further refinement of the law is likely to be cautious, incremental
and will likely look for steer to England and Wales, where the practice of litigation funding
has become more developed in recent years.
The practical benefit of third party litigation funding is clear, particularly in a trust context.
A beneficiary seeking to bring hostile proceedings against a trustee is often faced with a
financial institution with considerable resources at its disposal. The Royal Court is mindful of the issue of access to justice which has been a prominent feature in the rationale
for the acceptance of third party funding into Jersey litigation.383 Permitting an arrangement whereby the beneficiaries (who may be seeking restoration of the trust fund and are
without private resources to fund litigation themselves) to outsource the cost of bringing
proceedings, is a way of levelling the playing field between well financed trustees and impecunious beneficiaries.384

1-149

1-150

i. Types of Funding Arrangement
Litigation funding arrangements can be broadly divided between 'pure' funding arrangements and professional or 'for profit' arrangements. The significance of the distinction
between a 'pure' and 'for profit' arrangement is that a court is less likely to make a third
party adverse costs order against a 'pure funder'.385 A 'pure' funder funds an action on the
basis that, if the claim succeeds, they will recover only the contribution that they have made.
A pure funder has no control over the management of the litigation and will not profit
from it. There are few examples in Jersey case law of the Royal Court considering a 'pure'
funding arrangement but the enforceability of a pure funding arrangement is unlikely to
be challenged because it does not tend to excite the Court's suspicion that the purity of the
litigation is being corrupted by the funder for its own ends.
Where a third party funds litigation in the hope of making a profit from it, the rules against
maintenance and champerty are clearly potentially relevant. The vast majority of third

Litigating in Jersey

party litigation funding arrangements are of this latter 'for-profit' character. However, the
policy imperative of encouraging access to justice means that these arrangements are less
likely to be struck down by the courts as offending the rules against maintenance and champerty than was previously the case. Nevertheless, if the funder attempts to exercise any
concerted degree of control over the litigation, or stands to recover disproportionate sums
from the proceeds by way of profit, the Court can hold the agreement to be unenforceable.

ii. Factors for the Court to Take into Account in Upholding a Third Party Funding
Agreement
1-153

The Royal Court will be prepared to uphold a funding agreement that facilitates access
to justice by impecunious litigants, subject to appropriate safeguards to ensure that justice is not corrupted by the arrangement. The decision in Valetta arose out of a Beddoe
hearing.386 The arrangement in question was between a funder and a trustee appointed to
pursue its predecessor for a breach of trust claim. No party was arguing that the agreement
was unenforceable,387 however the case being the first of its kind, the Royal Court took
the opportunity to set out what it thought were the key touchstones that did not make the
agreement champertous. Whether a particular funding arrangement falls foul of the rule
against maintenance and champerty will depend on its terms and all the circumstances but
based on the existing Jersey and English authorities, the following factors are likely to have
a magnetic significance:
1.

The extent to which the funder controls the litigation. The courts recognise that the
funder will inevitably exercise some control over proceedings, otherwise the risk of
funding the litigation would be too great. The funder is permitted to insist that the
funded party conduct the litigation in accordance with the reasonable advice of their
lawyers.388 However, control that goes beyond this is more likely to give rise to a finding that the funding agreement is champertous. Examples of excessive control might
include:
i.
taking or influencing strategic decisions;
ii. seeking to interfere in the solicitor/client relationship; or
iii. controlling or meddling in settlement negotiation.
The applicable principles as to whether the funder has exercised an unacceptable level
of control in the litigation will overlap considerably with the principles governing the
circumstances in which the court may order costs against the funder as a non-party.

2.

The level of communication between the funded party and the solicitor. Where communications between the funded party and the solicitor on the record are limited, or where
there is no solicitor/client relationship between the funded party and that solicitor,
the arrangements are more likely to fall foul of the rules (see Clairs Keeley (a Firm)
v Treacy).389 Ideally, the solicitor should be independent of the funder, and alive to the
possibility of abuse or conflict of interest.
386 As to Beddoe applications in Jersey, see Ch 3.

387 Although the later decision in Barclays Wealth Trustees was the subject of full argument and a champertous
agreement was held to be unenforceability, whether it is also void or voidable was left at large.

The prejudice likely to be suffered by a defendant if the claim fails. A funding agreement
under which the funder is not liable to meet any adverse costs order against the funded
party is like to be considered unacceptable. If the funder is to have a commercial stake
if the litigation succeeds, it must also be 'on risk' to meet the other side's costs if the
claim fails. It is for this reason that a funding arrangement will also cover the cost of
ATE insurance as well.390
The extent to which the funded party is provided with information about, and is able to
make informed decisions concerning, the litigation.
The amount of profit that the funder stands to make. In Factortame, the Court took the
view that the 8 per cent payable to the firm of accountants funding the litigation was
not excessive. In Valetta, the Royal Court approved an agreement under which the
funder was entitled to a maximum of 50 per cent of the proceeds of the litigation or
three times the plaintiff 's legal costs whichever was the greater. Fifty per cent probably
represents the limit of what the Royal Court will be prepared to approve. Where the
funded party is no longer in a position to benefit from a successful outcome, the court
is more likely to find that the agreement is champertous.
Whether or not there is a risk of inflaming costs and damages. This is, obviously, more
of a risk in the context of contingency fee agreements which are not permitted under
Jersey law.
Whether or not there is a risk of distorting evidence. It is extremely unlikely that an agreement whereby expert witnesses were paid on a contingency basis could ever be upheld
as valid: the risk that the evidence would be distorted is too great.
Whether or not the funder is a professional funder and/or is regulated. In Factortame,
the accountants providing the funding were of a reputable and regulated profession.
Unregulated funders are likely to be scrutinised with more care. A voluntary Code of
Conduct for Litigation Funders was introduced in November 2011 in England and
Wales. In both the Valetta and Barclays Wealth Trustees cases the funder, Harbour Litigation Investment Funding LLP, was a member of the Association of Litigation Funders
of England and Wales and a signatory to the voluntary Code of Conduct for Litigation
Funders.

iii. Consequences of a Champertous Funding Arrangement
If a funding agreement is found to be champertous, the consequences are as follows:
1.

The agreement itself is unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Whether the agreement is void ab initio or voidable is unclear.391 The funder will be unable to enforce the
agreement against the funded party (meaning, in the case of solicitors, that fees and
expenses will not be recoverable, either under the agreement or even on a quantum
meruit basis).392
390 As to which see below.

391 [2013 (2) JLR 22] at [44]; Pothier's Traité des Obligations (1821 edn) vol 1, para 43 provides: 'Lorsque la
cause pour laquelle l'engagement a été contracté est une cause qui blesse la justice, la bonne foi ou les bonnes
mœurs, cet engagement est nul, ainsi que le contrat qui le renferme'. ['When the cause for which the commitment
was made is a cause that hurts justice, good faith or morals, this commitment and the contract that contains it is
nothing'].

Litigating in Jersey
The claim to which the agreement pertains is not to be automatically struck out unless
it amounts to an abuse of process.
As a result of the indemnity principle,393 a successful funded party will be unable to
recover costs from its opponent because it will be under no enforceable liability to its
funder.
The fact that litigation is funded under an unenforceable agreement does not amount
to a defence to the substantive claim for which funding was sought.394
The existence of an unenforceable funding agreement will not provide grounds for the
stay or strike out of the proceedings, unless the circumstances independently give rise
to grounds for saying that the proceedings are an abuse of process.395
The circumstances of the case may give rise to grounds justifying a third party costs
order under Article 2 of the Civil Proceedings (Jersey) Law 1956,396 against the third
party funder, although it appears the Royal Court has power to make such an order
irrespective of whether or not the agreement is unenforceable. The availability of this
power is referred to in Barclays Wealth Management397 so as to provide solace to a successful party who is unable to obtain an order for costs against a funded party because
that party cannot enforce the agreement that the funder pays its adverse costs. In the
leading English Court of Appeal case of Arkin v Borchard Lines Ltd and Ors,398 approved
in Valetta, the funder was held to be liable for costs up to the amount of its own contribution even though the arrangement was not held to be champertous but the Court
made it clear that, if the agreement had been champertous, the funder's liability for
costs could have been unlimited.

iv. After the Event Insurance
1-155

1-156

After the Event, or ATE insurance is an insurance policy taken out by a plaintiff after a dispute has arisen to protect against the risk of an order for adverse costs if the litigation is lost.
Owing to the risk that a professional litigation funder might be required to meet the funded
party's adverse costs, it is often used in combination with third party litigation funding to
protect the funder from the risk of an adverse third party costs order being made against it
in the event the proceedings are lost.399
The tactical advantage to a plaintiff of informing the defendant about his ATE cover (other
than being personally free of the risk of an adverse costs order) is limited to implicitly
indicating that the plaintiff has had the benefit of a commercially minded third party assess
the claim to be worth proceeding with. The cost risk to an opponent of an ATE premium
would be of considerable tactical advantage to a beneficiary in trust litigation. A trustee
is unlikely to obtain Beddoe relief in hostile litigation directed towards it,400 and (if the

litigation is defended) the trustee exposes itself to a costs order of even greater magnitude
if the litigation is lost and to which it is not entitled to be indemnified from the trust fund.
There is unchallenged Jersey authority to the effect that the ATE premium is not a 'costs of
the action' and is therefore not an item of recoverable cost which the Court may award to
against the losing party to litigation.401 Given the ATE premium can be a significant percentage of the overall quantum of an adverse cost award, its non-recoverability deprives a
plaintiff of a significant tactical advantage. Riley v Pickersgill is over a decade old, is only
the decision of a Master rather than the full Royal Court, and is in any event obiter. Given
ATE is one of a package of measures, including third party funding, that facilitates access
to justice, following the strong policy statement in Valleta, the rationale that underpins the
non-recoverability of the premium may be ripe for revision.

v. Non-Party Cost Orders
The jurisdiction of the Royal Court to order costs against a third party funder, as a nonparty, has not yet been fully refined. Article 2(1) of the Civil Proceedings (Jersey) Law 1956
provides:

1-157

Subject to the provisions of this Part and to rules of court made under the Royal Court (Jersey) Law
1948, the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the Royal Court shall be in the discretion of
the court and the Court shall have full power to determine by who and what extend the costs are
to be paid.

Section 51(1) and 51(3) Senior Courts Act 1981 which is in similar terms to Article 2(1),
provides that 'the costs incidental to all proceedings […] shall be in the discretion of the
court […and] the court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent the
costs are to be paid'. In terms, section 51 does not specifically provide for a power to order
costs against a non-party but in the House of Lords in Aiden Shipping v Interbulk Ltd (The
Vimeira) (No 2)402 held that the section did in fact provide for such a power. Aiden Shipping
was cited with approval in the Jersey decision of Drake v Gouveia and Anor:

1-158

In our judgment, the principles laid down in Aiden Shipping […] are equally applicable in Jersey.
The words 'by whom' in art. 2(1) of the Civil Procedure (Jersey) Law 1956 are wide enough to
embrace any non-party whom the court, in the exercise of its discretion, considers ought justly to
be ordered to pay the costs. No doubt this is a jurisdiction which ought to be exercised sparingly
and with caution. Nonetheless, particularly in these days, when the costs of litigation threaten to
make the courts inaccessible in practice to sections of the community, it is a power which the court
should use in appropriate circumstances in order to ensure that litigants are not unfairly treated
[…] the issue for determination was the question by whom the costs should, in accordance with
reason and justice, be paid.403

principles were followed in Arkin, which was approved by the Royal Court in Valetta. Neither of these authorities is strictly binding in Jersey but given the relative infancy of both
litigation funding and the ancillary issue of costs against funders in the event the funded
claim fails in Jersey, the Royal Court is likely to look to England for steer as to how it might
develop its law.
a. Principles
1-160

The risk to a funder in the award of a non-party costs order turns on the issue of to what
extent the funder has control over the litigation. Generally the jurisdiction to order costs
against a non-party will not be exercised against a pure funder.405 Where however the nonparty not only funds but also substantially controls or at any rate is to benefit (in the sense
of profit rather than recoupment of outlay) from the proceedings, he will usually be liable
to pay the costs if the action is unsuccessful.406 In Arkin, it was held that a professional, forprofit funder who financed part of the costs of the litigation should be liable for the other
side's costs but capped to the same extent. In Arkin, the funding arrangement was not held
to be champertous and the decision was expressly said to be confined to these cases. It follows that where the arrangement is champertous, the funder will be potentially liable for the
entire costs of the action. That a non-party acted without impropriety and on legal advice
does not prevent an order being made against him, although impropriety or the pursuit of
speculative litigation would of course support making an order.407 While the general rule
is that costs follow the event, the question of costs is a matter of discretion for the Court.
What may be sufficient to justify an exercise of the discretion in one case should not be
treated as a necessary factor for the exercise of the discretion in a different case.408 It is not
necessary for the non-party to be made exclusively liable for costs or liable for all the applicant's costs. An order may be limited to part of the costs only; this solution is particularly
appropriate where there is an issue as to the extent to which costs were incurred and caused
by the funder. Although the Court has jurisdiction to make a non-party order even where
the conduct complained of has not caused the applicant to incur the costs sought to be
recovered, the English cases where the Court has exercised its discretion to make the order
in the absence of causation have been rare and the consensus from the Court of Appeal in
a number of judgments appear to be that where there is no causation (going to the issue of
the funder's control of the litigation) a third party order is not usually appropriate.409

b. Procedure for Seeking an Order for Costs against a Non-party
The non-party must be (1) added as a party to the proceedings for the purpose of costs
only410 and (2) given a reasonable opportunity to attend a hearing at which the Court will
consider whether to make an order for costs against the non-party. It is not necessary that
the non-party be joined as a party to the proceedings from the outset; it is sufficient for the
receiving party to make an application by way of summons in the course of the usual costs
arguments at the end of proceedings. It appears, that the Court has jurisdiction to make a
non-party order, even when all arguments over costs between the parties have been dealt
with by the Court and an inter partes costs order has been made. A non-party costs order is
'in the strictest sense supplemental to the judgment already pronounced and sealed and in
no way varies it'.411 This raises the possibility of seeking a non-party costs order only when
enforcement of a costs order against a named party to the proceedings has failed. While
there is no procedural requirement to do so it is prudent to warn the proposed respondent
of an intention to issue a summons for an order for costs against the third party funder as
soon as possible.412 There are a number of competing English (but no Jersey) authorities
on the importance of giving notice. It has been suggested that a failure to warn as soon as
the possibility arises can be fatal to an application.413 However, in later and higher English
authority in Farrell and another v Direct Accident Management Services Ltd and Anor414 it
was held that it was insignificant that early notice was not given. In ordering a non-party
to pay costs, on the indemnity basis the English High Court has held415 that there was no
binding requirement to give notice of the application, on the basis of what the Court had
seen and the views it had formed of the non-party's character, it was satisfied that it was
'positively unlikely' that he would have done anything different from continuing to defend
the claim and pursuing the counterclaims, even if had been warned of the application.
Hitachi Capital (UK) Plc v V-12 Finance Ltd and Ors416 provides a reminder of the need to
notify third parties that costs orders are to be sought against them (referring to the discussion on this in Oriakhel v Vickers and Ors)417 and a warning that the Court can take account
of a failure to give notice, although in the case a non-party order was granted. Referring to
the competing authorities on notice, the Court drew the following distinction: first, where
the failure to give notice 'creates a trap for the unwary', there is a clear cause for concern but
where a non-party 'plays "hardball" with the assistance of experienced solicitors', there is no
reason why a failure to warn should provide a technical obstacle to doing justice.

410 Where the third party funder is overseas, an application to serve out of the jurisdiction needs to be made in
accordance with the principles discussed in Ch 2. In the absence of a specific gateway applicable to costs, cf CPR
PD 6B.3.1(18), r 7(c) ('necessary or proper party') is likely to be the most appropriate gateway.

Litigating in Jersey

c. Applications to Trial Judge
1-162

The application for a third party costs order is made by way of summons usually to be heard
before the trial judge.418 The fact that the judge may have already expressed views on the
conduct of the non-party constitutes neither bias nor the appearance of bias.419 It seems
that the summons should be served on all other parties as well as the non-party respondent
to the application.420
d. Summary Procedure

1-163

The liability of a non-party to pay the costs of an action can be dealt with summarily if the
non-party had close proximity to or direction of the proceedings, for example as a funder
to the litigation. Ordinarily, however, a non-party who has not funded an action and had
no personal interest in it would not be liable for the costs incurred by the unsuccessful party
without a full hearing on the merits.421 The judge's findings of fact in the main action may
be admissible, provided that the connection of the non-party with the original proceedings
was so close that he will suffer no injustice if the evidence is admitted.422 The fact that the
procedure is a summary procedure should not preclude the making of the order in a complex case.423 The costs of an action can easily outweigh the sums otherwise in dispute and,
if justice requires those costs to be borne by a non-party, the fact that a substantial hearing
is required should not get in the way. Were it otherwise, there would be the ludicrous result
that the more complex (and, therefore, expensive) a case is, the less likely it is that a nonparty order would be made.
e. Ancillary Orders

1-164

In some cases it may be appropriate to use the application for a non-party costs order as
a forum to obtain ancillary orders for discovery of documents for the purposes of determining the application for the non-party costs order. In the English case of Thomson
v Berkhamsted Collegiate School,424 Blake J granted requests for ancillary orders for disclosure, in the context of an application for costs against non-parties. The Court held that,
before considering whether the ancillary orders sought in the case were necessary, the starting point should be to consider the likelihood of a third-party costs order being made.
If the case for a non-party order was weak, it was inherently improbable that an order
would be made. Conversely if the case was 'overwhelming', it was unlikely that ancillary
orders (for example, for disclosure, inspection or cross-examination) would be necessary.

418 Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson (n 412) at [193] (with any necessary application for service of the summons
made for service out of the jurisdiction made to the Judicial Greffier). The Judicial Greffier also has jurisdiction
to make a third party costs order concurrent with the Bailiff; see Drake (née Neville) v Gouveia [2000 JLR 411].

Research International v ABG Exploration [1999] CPLR 756 but cf Holden v Oyston [2002] EWHC 819 (QB) at [8].
424 [2009] EWHC 2374 (QB).

Funding Solutions

73

The f­ ollowing issues are also likely to be of significance in deciding whether ancillary orders
are required:
1.
2.

3.
4.

The strength of the application for a non-costs order unassisted by the disclosure
sought.
The potential importance of the documents sought, including whether they were likely
to clarify issues relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion or, alternatively, if they
may lead to satellite litigation.
Whether, on a summary assessment, it was obvious that the documents would be subject to legal professional privilege.425
Whether the likely effect of any order the Court wanted to make would be proportionate and just in all the circumstances.

It remains a matter of controversy whether an application for ancillary orders for disclosure can be made to enable a party to bring an application for a non-party costs order. In
the English case of Systemcare (UK) Ltd v Services Design Technology Ltd and Anor, Lloyd
LJ criticised the claimant for putting the proverbial cart before the horse and said that
'If a section 51 application cannot be made on the documents already available it should
not normally be made at all'.426 However, in another English decision, Germany v Flatman,427 Eady J granted orders for the claimants' solicitors to give disclosure of information
on how the two joined claims had been funded. In each case, the defendants had successfully resisted a personal injury claim and obtained an order for costs, but had little prospect
of recovering anything from the claimants. The same firm of solicitors had represented the
claimants under a conditional fee arrangement, but without after the event insurance. The
defendants suspected that the solicitors had funded the claims to some extent by defraying
disbursements, but did not have the evidence to support an application for a non-party
costs order. In Relfo Ltd (In Liquidation) v Varsani & Ors,428 the English Court of Appeal
rejected appeals of non-party costs orders based upon grounds that the judge should not
have ordered freezing injunctions to aid enforcement of the non-party orders. The Court of
Appeal held he was entitled to exercise his discretion as he did regarding the freezing orders.
The judge was entitled, in the light of the egregious dishonesty which he found established
in the trial, to attempt to ring-fence whatever assets there might be to meet the orders he
made.

f. Points in Considering a Non-party Costs Order against a Third Party Litigation Funder
One of the greatest difficulties for a party seeking a non-party costs order against a litigation funder is discovering whether the litigation is being funded at all and by whom. The
arrangement is essentially a private one between the funder and the funded party. It is

425 See The Owners and/or Demise Charterers of the Dredger 'Kamal XXVI' and the Barge 'Kamal XXIV' v The
Owners of the Ship 'Ariela' [2010] EWHC 2531 (Comm) as an example of the extended application of the fraud
exception to communications between a solicitor and an 'innocent' client who is being used by a fraudster to perpetrate a crime in order to circumvent the issue of privileged in documents.

Litigating in Jersey

s­ensible to ask one's opponent how the litigation is being funded. If the opponent refuses
to tell you, an application can be made by summons for an order for disclosure by the
opponent and his solicitors, but not usually until the proceedings have concluded. The
application should be on notice, supported by an affidavit setting out the basis on which it
is believed that the matter is being funded by a third party (for example, evidence of the litigating party's lack of funds). When serving the other parties, it is prudent to inform them
that no liability is accepted for any costs incurred by them, as opposed to the respondent
to the application. This should encourage them not to participate in the application at all.
The respondent should be invited to consent to the application that he be joined to the proceedings. If he does, directions for the conduct of the substantive application (such as the
provision of affidavits) will probably be capable of agreement, the first-stage order having
been made by consent and the Court can be asked simply to list the substantive application
for an agreed date. If the respondent does not consent to be joined, the application should
be listed simply as one for joinder of the non-party and directions for the hearing of the
substantive application. The directions to be sought will include directions for:
1.
2.
3.
4.
1-167

The exchange of evidence.
Any disclosure sought (for which grounds should be stated in the supporting affidavit).
The preparation of bundles.
The listing of the substantive hearing.

In anything other than the simplest litigation, both the application for joinder of the nonparty and the substantive application for the order for costs against the non-party should
usually be made to the trial judge, who will have been immersed in the detail of the litigation, rather than the Master. At all times, the parties should be mindful of the proportionality of the costs in doing so as against what can be obtained. Parties and their legal advisors
should be well advised of the dangers in terms of costs of litigating about comparatively
small sums in a manner that was only commensurate with much larger issues. Litigation
ought to be proportionate to the need for reasonable remedies, not an exercise in attrition.429 If there are grounds to seek security for costs and if such an application is likely to
succeed it may be better to proceed down that path rather than seek costs against a third
party funder after the event. A party who fails to seek security where there were obvious
grounds to do so takes a risk which can be taken into account by the Court in its discretion
whether to order costs against a funder and may be of significant sway in what is a highly
discretionary exercise of the Court's jurisdiction. In a situation like that in Valetta, where
the trust and beneficiaries are otherwise impecunious save for the cause of action against
a previous trustee, the trustee should seek the Court's blessing of a funding agreement as
part of any Beddoe application. The litigation funder is likely to be out of the jurisdiction
and will usually have otherwise been joined to the proceedings. Where the respondent to
the application for a non-party costs order is out of the jurisdiction, an application will
need to be made to serve-out a summons applying for him to be joined as a party under
rule 6/36(b)(ii) RCR 2004. Jersey does not have an equivalent of CPR PD 6B.3.1(18)-the
jurisdictional gateway through which a claim may be made by a party to proceedings for an

429

Sims v Hawkins [2007] EWCA Civ 1175.

75

order that the court exercise its power to make a costs order in favour of or against a person
who is not a party to those proceedings. RCR 7(c) of the 1994 rules provides the appropriate gateway: the claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdiction and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party thereto.
g. The Effect of the Order for Costs against a Non-party
An order that a non-party should pay costs is enforceable like any other order. If the costs
have not been taxed between the parties when the order is made, the non-party will be a
party to the taxation in the conventional way. If the costs of the litigation have been taxed
between parties before the order is made, the non-party should not, in principle, be bound
by the amount of costs so assessed, as he has not had an opportunity to challenge that
amount. It is sensible to deal with this issue when the order against the non-party is made.
Ordinarily, the non-party should be served with a bill of costs and given an opportunity to
challenge it by points of dispute in the usual way. It has not yet been determined whether
Jersey's Royal Court has an equivalent power to that identified in Nelson v Greening & Sykes
(Builders) Ltd430 under section 51(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 to order a non-party
to pay a sum of costs which have already been taxed in its absence. The precise approach
will depend on the facts.431 In Nelson, it was held appropriate because the non-party had
been acting in tandem with Mr Nelson and there was 'a more than sufficient degree of
identification' between them in the conduct of these proceedings to make it just to order
the non-party to pay the costs. The Court had power to 'determine by whom and to what
extent the costs are to be paid' and Lawrence Collins LJ did not think that the phrase 'to
what extent' was limited to issues of proportion and he rejected the submission that it did
not extend to quantum.

Conflict of Law Issues in Jersey
Trust Litigation
I. Introduction
The conflict of laws is concerned with a situation in which a legal matter has connections
with the legal system of more than one jurisdiction. Owing to the island's status as a preeminent financial centre, some cross-border element is a very common feature in Jersey trust
litigation. It would not be unusual, for example, to have a settlor domiciled in Guernsey
establish a trust governed by Jersey law over the shares of companies registered in the
­British Virgin Islands, vested in trustees located in the Cayman Islands with beneficiaries in
Canada and Monaco.
There are essentially three key considerations for any practitioner engaged in a Jersey trust
dispute.
1.

2-1

2-2

In what circumstances will the Royal Court have jurisdiction to hear and decide crossborder trust litigation?
Which jurisdiction's law will the Royal Court apply to determine the dispute on the
merits?
When will the Jersey court recognise and give effect to a judgment made overseas?

2.
3.

This chapter is dedicated to (1) and (2) with the recognition and enforcement of foreign
judgments and orders discussed in Chapter 15.

II. Jurisdiction
A. Jurisdiction Based on Service within the Jurisdiction
The Royal Court will have jurisdiction over any defendant who is properly served with
an appropriate form of originating process.1 The Royal Court's jurisdiction will be automatic if service is properly affected within the Bailiwick of Jersey.2 Indeed as in England, the

See Ch 1 for discussion of service of legal process within the jurisdiction.

78

Conflict of Law Issues

j­urisdiction of the Royal Court, whether service is within or without the Bailiwick, is based
upon effective service of process. Proof of service is evidenced either by way of an affidavit
of service (in cases where ordinary service is permitted) and (within the jurisdiction) by the
Viscount's official record of service, where personal service is required.3 The Royal Court
will also have jurisdiction if a defendant, wherever located, submits to proceedings in Jersey,4
although a defendant will not be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the Royal
Court if his only participation in the proceedings is to contest the Royal Court's jurisdiction.5

i. Jurisdiction Conferred by other Means
2-5

The Royal Court will also have prima facie jurisdiction (subject to a successful challenge to
the jurisdiction of the Court) if the trust instrument confers jurisdiction on the courts of
Jersey.6 The Royal Court will also have prima facie jurisdiction over a trust in the following
circumstances:7
the trust is a Jersey trust,8 wherever the location of the trustee, the trust assets or the
beneficiaries;
the trustee of a foreign trust9 is resident in Jersey;
any property of a foreign trust is situated in Jersey;10 or
the administration of any trust property of a foreign trust is carried on in Jersey.11

ii. Consequences of Submission to the Jurisdiction of a Foreign Court
2-6

Trustees of a Jersey trust, who submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court in accordance
with its own conflicts of laws rules, expose themselves personally and the trust assets situated
within that jurisdiction to the process of the foreign court.12 Such assets may be exposed
anyway, if under the relevant foreign procedural rules the trustee can be brought within
the foreign court's jurisdiction regardless of whether or not the trustee submits voluntarily.
Submitting to the jurisdiction of a foreign court may13 lead, not only to recognition and

jurisdiction rules in Art 5 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law do not apply, recourse must be had to the ordinary rules for
jurisdiction. These are contained in the Royal Court Rules 2004, pt 5 (for service on the defendant within Jersey),
and the Service of Process Rules 1994 (for service on the defendant outside Jersey, excluding para 7(j)).

11 There are no reported decisions on the precise scope of this provision. In Heinrichs v Pantrust International
SA & Ors [2016] JRC 106A, Art 5(d) was sought to be relied upon on the basis that a Dutch registered company
had a Jersey director and a Dutch resident director but on the facts it was held that the appointment of the Jersey
director did not constitute administration of trust property in Jersey.
12 As to whether, in submitting to the process of a foreign court, the trustee has exposed itself and the trust
assets to enforcement of that foreign process in Jersey, see the discussion of the Art 9 'firewall' provisions in Ch 15.

Jurisdiction

79

enforcement in Jersey of foreign judgments on personal claims against the trustees, but also
to a recognition and enforcement against the trust assets, potentially to the detriment of the
beneficiaries. Jersey has a well-developed corpus of authority as to the consequences following the trustee's decision to submit (or not to submit) to the jurisdiction of the Family
Division of the English High Court and whether the outcome of those proceedings is as a
consequence capable of recognition and enforcement against them and the trust in Jersey.14
The Royal Court may be hesitant to recognise or enforce a foreign court order against a
trustee of a Jersey trust even if the trustee has submitted to the foreign jurisdiction, since
such an order is generally regarded as an exorbitant exercise of jurisdiction.15 Trustees of
a Jersey trust who receive service or notice of proceedings from a foreign court are well
advised to do nothing until they have (promptly) obtained appropriate legal advice; and it
may well be appropriate for them to apply to the Royal Court for directions as to how, if at
all, they should respond to the foreign proceedings.

B. Jurisdiction Based on Service out of the Jurisdiction
A large proportion of Jersey trust litigation, particularly claims concerning the recovery or
restoration of trust property, have an international element that requires that the proceedings be served out of the jurisdiction in order to bring all the proper parties before the Royal
Court. A defendant who cannot be served within the jurisdiction must be served (and such
service not subsequently set aside) outside Jersey in order for the Royal Court to be able
to exercise any jurisdiction over them. Jersey has long recognised the distinction between
service as of right and where the plaintiff requires leave to serve-out.16 A plaintiff who
seeks leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction must seek leave of the Court before
service-out can be effective to join the overseas defendant to the Jersey proceedings.17 For a
plaintiff, an application to serve out comprises a two-stage process:18
1.
2.

2-7

the proceedings to which it is sought to join the defendant must fall within at least one
of the jurisdictional gateways in rule 7 of the Service of Process Rules 1994; and
the Court is satisfied that Jersey, rather than any other jurisdiction, is, using the Latin
maxim, forum conveniens, ie Jersey is clearly the most appropriate place in which to
bring the claim to which it is sought to add the overseas defendant.

i. Jurisdictional Gateways
Permission to serve-out cannot be given save through one of the 'gateways' specified in rule 7
of the 1994 Rules. Each cause of action to which a defendant outside Jersey is sought to be

joined must fall within at least one of the gateways. It is not sufficient that only one or some
of the causes of action falls within a gateway: leave will not be given for those that do not
fall within the gateway identified.19 The gateways that are conceivably relevant to a Jersey
dispute either under or against a trust are as follows:
(a) relief is sought against a person domiciled within the jurisdiction;20
(b) an injunction is sought ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing anything within
the jurisdiction (whether or not damages are also claimed in respect of the doing of or failure
to do that thing);
(c) the claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdiction and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party thereto;
(d) the claim is brought to enforce, rescind, dissolve, annul or otherwise affect a contract, or to
recover damages or obtain other relief in respect of the breach of a contract, being (in either
case) a contract which -
(i)
was made within the jurisdiction,
(ii) was made by or through an agent trading or residing within the jurisdiction on
behalf of a principal trading or residing out of the jurisdiction,
(iii) is by its terms, or by implication, governed by Jersey law, or
(iv) contains a term to the effect that the Royal Court shall have jurisdiction to hear
and determine any action in respect of the contract;
(e) the claim is brought in respect of a breach committed within the jurisdiction of a contract
made within or out of the jurisdiction, and irrespective of the fact, if such be the case, that
the breach was preceded or accompanied by a breach committed out of the jurisdiction that
rendered impossible the performance of so much of the contract as ought to have been performed within the jurisdiction;
[…]
(h) the claim is brought to construe, rectify, set aside or enforce an act, deed, will, contract, obligation or liability affecting land situate within the jurisdiction;
(i) the claim is made for a debt secured on immovable property or is made to assert, declare or
determine proprietary or possessory rights, or rights of security, in or over movable property,
or to obtain authority to dispose of movable property, situate within the jurisdiction;
(j) the claim or application is brought within the terms of Article 5 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984;
(k) the claim is made for the administration of the movable estate of a person who died domiciled within the jurisdiction or for any relief which might be obtained in any such action;
(l) the claim is brought in a probate action;
(m) the claim is brought to enforce any judgment or arbitral award;
[…]
(o) the claim is made under the Proceeds of Crime (Cash Seizure) (Jersey) Law 2008;
[…]
(q) the claim is brought for money had and received or for an account or other relief against the
defendant as constructive trustee, and the defendant's alleged liability arises out of acts committed, whether by the defendant or otherwise, within the jurisdiction.
19 The Siskina [1979] AC at 255, per Lord Diplock, affirmed in Maywal Limited v Nautech Services Limited
[2014 (2) JLR 527]; Heinrichs v Pantrust International SA & Ors (n 11).
20 Jersey's recognition of the concept of domicile largely follows that prevailing at common law in England
and Wales; In The Matter Of The Representation Of Hawksford Executors Limited [2013 (2) JLR 357]. This gateway
means effectively that anyone born in Jersey with either a Jersey domicile of origin, a Jersey domicile of dependence or a Jersey domicile of choice, even if resident outside the island, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the
Royal Court.

Jurisdiction

81

ii. Rule 7(b): Injunctive Relief
The Royal Court had jurisdiction to grant free-standing21 interlocutory and post-judgment
injunctive relief, including Mareva/freezing relief, against a defendant who is out of the
jurisdiction in support of either Jersey or foreign proceedings with ancillary orders for
disclosure.22

2-9

iii. Rule 7(c): A Necessary or Proper Party
The rule contains two requirements. The first is that the claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdiction. The second is that the person to be
served out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party to the action. Any application requires careful consideration of the position of the defendant who has already been
served; and of the nature of the claim and the relevance of the party to be served overseas
to the claim.23 A claim by a defendant against a third party for a contribution falls within
the scope of the rule.24 A person will be a necessary or proper party if their rights are
affected by the lis between the existing parties to the proceedings.25 The Court will be alive
to the risk of rule 7(c) being abused by serving an anchor (but otherwise minor defendant)
in the jurisdiction in order to bring the real claims against those outside the Bailiwick.26
It will be persuasive if the claims sought to be brought against the person outside Jersey
arise from the same underlying factual matrix with common factual and legal issues so as
to raise the risk of an irreconcilable judgment if the person is not joined.27 If the Court is
satisfied that a third party should be joined under rr 6/10 or 6/36 RCR 2004 it is highly likely
for justice to require they be joined as a party to the proceedings.

2-10

iv. Rule 7(j): Trusts
Article 528 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law applies only to litigation under a trust and has no application to litigation which is external to the trust relationship, for example a legal dispute in
which the trustee becomes embroiled in the course of its administration of the trust, eg a
contractual dispute or a dispute between a third party and companies owned by the trust.
Article 7 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides that a trust may come into existence in
any manner and, in particular, may arise by conduct. The Royal Court has held that Article 5

of the Trusts (Jersey) Law applies to so-called 'constructive trusts'.29 Article 33(1) provides
that, where a person (referred to in the article as a 'constructive trustee') makes or receives
any profit, gain or advantage from a breach of trust, that person 'shall be deemed to be a
trustee of that profit, gain or advantage'.30 Article 33(3) provides that a constructive trustee
'shall deliver up the property of which the person is a constructive trustee to the person
properly entitled to it'. Since Article 2 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides that a trust
exists not only where a person actually holds or has vested in him property for the benefit
of any person but also where he is deemed to do so, it is clear that a constructive trust is a
trust within the meaning of Article 5.
2-13

The factual circumstances in which a constructive trust can arise are innumerable and the
terms of Article 33 itself make clear that it does not provide an exhaustive definition. It is
far from clear that all categories of constructive trusts come within the scope of Article 5.
Article 33 clearly encompasses a 'category 1' constructive trustee.31 Bender was concerned
with a so-called 'category 1' constructive trusteeship. The scope of 'constructive trustee' in
Article 33 suggests a knowing recipient would come within the definition of a constructive
trustee under the article as one who 'makes or receives any profit, gain or advantage from
a breach of trust'. Whether a dishonest assistant would likewise be treated as a constructive
trustee for the purposes of Article 5 is unclear. A dishonest assistant does not necessarily 'make
or receive any profit, gain or advantage from a breach of trust' although he is under a duty
to account as though he were, or deemed to be, a constructive trustee.32 While Article 33(4)
states in terms that it is not exhaustive of the circumstances under which a person may be
or become a constructive trustee, whether that article applies to a dishonest assistant must
be open to doubt. However, a claim in dishonest assistance (and knowing receipt where a
proprietary claim is no long viable) would certainly fall within rule 7(q) as claims for an
account or other relief against the defendant as constructive trustee.

v. Rule 7(q): Liability as a Constructive Trustee, Claims for Restitution
and 'other Relief '
a. A Claim for Money Had and Received
2-14

There is little reported authority in Jersey in which the action for money had and received,
has received judicial attention. The English analysis on money had and received draws
attention to it being an action at common law. As has already been discussed, Jersey is neither a common law jurisdiction nor is the strict divide between law and equity observed.
It has yet to be established whether the Court would accept an argument that the Jersey
equivalent of an action for money had and received is an action in restitution for unjust
enrichment, as outlined in the case of Flynn v Reid.33

be said to arise under Jersey law, see Ch 6.

b. A Claim for an Account or other Relief against the Defendant as Constructive Trustee
We have already discussed that Article 5 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law has been held to encompass constructive trusts. It is unclear whether rule 7(q) encompasses every category of constructive trustee. Bender confirms that claims based on accessory liability, which do not in
themselves give rise to proprietary remedy, fall within rule 7(q), thereby covering actions
for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt (which are properly to be characterised as
an action for an account as if a constructive trustee).34 An action for inconsistent dealing35
would also appear to come within the definition of constructive trust for the purposes of
the jurisdictional gateway.

2-15

What is the relationship between rule 7(j) and rule 7(q)? Given any claim or application in
which the Royal Court has jurisdiction under Article 5 of the Trusts Law is already a gateway through which the Court may serve-out under rule 7(j), it might be thought there are
should be no overlap between the categories of constructive trust covered by Article 536 and
the categories of constructive trustee in rule 7(q). However, Bender is clear that constructive
trust claims were not excluded from rule 7(j) merely because rule 7(q) applied to constructive trusts. The fact that rule 7(q) applies, in terms, to constructive trusts does not justify the
conclusion that rule 7(j) should be read as applying only to express trusts. The Court in that
case envisages circumstances in which a constructive trustee would fall within the terms of
rule 7(j) but outside the terms of rule 7(q). For example, a foreign constructive trust may
have been created by reason of acts taking place out of Jersey. The property of such a trust
may be in Jersey. In that case, rule 7(j) would apply, but not rule 7(q).37 The meaning of
constructive trust in rule 7(q) and Article 33 are aligned so the definition of constructive
trustee in rule 7(q) is not therefore wider than the meaning given to the term 'constructive
trustee' in Bender.38
Rule 7(q) includes claims for 'other relief ', and appears to envisage the possibility of a claim
against a constructive trustee which is neither a proprietary claim nor a claim for an account.
This is potentially wide enough to include, what has become known in England as a Diplock
claim (ie a claim against an innocent receiver of property imbued with a trust) and a claim
for equitable recoupment even though a defendant to such an action is not necessarily
termed a constructive trustee within the meaning of Article 33, which would throw the
decision in Bender, that the two definitions are aligned, into doubt.
The defendant's alleged liability must 'arise out of acts committed within the jurisdiction'
but rule 7(q) seems clear that the relevant acts need not be committed by the defendant;
all that is required is some link between acts committed within the jurisdiction and the
defendant.39 It was a matter of controversy in English law for some years as to whether all
the acts upon which liability is founded are needed to have been committed within the

jurisdiction.40 In Polly Peck International plc v Nadir,41 Knox J said that his own preference
was for the construction which did not require all the acts constituting the constructive
trust to have been committed within the jurisdiction. To construe the then prevailing
­English equivalent of Jersey's rule 7(q) so as to require all the acts constituting the constructive trust to have been committed within the jurisdiction would empty it of very nearly
all its practical utility when one has regard to the prevalence of foreign corporations whose
officers are very likely to be resident abroad and therefore only likely to acquire the necessary knowledge to establish the claimed constructive trust by events occurring abroad. The
Jersey Court of Appeal has rejected the proposition that in order to come within the scope
of the rule even a substantial part of the acts which give rise to the alleged liability took
place in Jersey.42 Practically, and in a jurisdiction like Jersey where litigation arises from acts
that have connections to multiple jurisdictions, it would be anomalous if jurisdiction over
an overseas entity used by a fraudulent fiduciary to receive the proceeds of fraud committed
within the jurisdiction depended upon whether or not the entity maintained a Jersey bank
account into which the proceeds were paid. Given the strong policy objective of Jersey's
authorities in safeguarding the island's financial industry against fraud, a broad construction of rule 7(q) would be facilitative of this purpose.

C. Standard and Burden of Proof
2-19

Where leave is sought to serve-out, the burden falls to the plaintiff to satisfy the Court of
two matters before the Court can proceed to consider whether Jersey is clearly the most
appropriate forum:43
1.

that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the proceedings come within the jurisdictional gateway; and
that there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits of each cause of action said to fall
within one or more of the jurisdictional gateways.

2.
2-20

While the vast majority of trust proceedings that require an application for leave to serve
the proceedings out of the jurisdiction will clearly fall within at least one of the gateways
set out above there remains the possibility (which has come to the fore in recent years as
­Jersey's trust law remedies have needed to adapted to ever more sophisticated factual and
legal situations) for a dispute to arise as to whether a particular claim, as pleaded, falls
squarely within a gateway.44

i. A Good Arguable Case
2-21

The plaintiff must show that he has a good arguable case that each claim pleaded against
a defendant falls within one of the jurisdictional gateways in rule 7. It is not sufficient that

only one of a number of causes of action falls within a particular gateway: leave will be
refused (or the Court will decline to accept jurisdiction if service is challenged) for those
that do not.45 The affidavit in support must state clearly which gateway is relied upon.46
At this stage in proceedings, the plaintiff does not have to prove a good arguable case on the
merits of the proposed action.47 Surmounting the 'good arguable case' threshold requires
establishing that it is more than merely arguable that the claim as pleaded comes within one
of the gateways relied upon by the plaintiff but the threshold is not so high as to require
proof on the balance of probabilities, ie the threshold somewhere between being merely
arguable and the civil standard of being more likely than not. Whether the plaintiff can
establish a good arguable case is normally decided on affidavits and without full disclosure
and/or cross-examination of witnesses. The Court must be concerned not to appear to
express some concluded view as to the merits, eg as to whether the contract existed or not.48
Jersey has on occasion applied the so-called 'Canadian Trust gloss'49 namely, whether the
plaintiff has shown that it has much the better (or at least the better) of the argument on the
underlying merits in an application to serve out of the jurisdiction.50 The effect of the gloss
is to require the plaintiff to satisfy a good arguable case 'plus' test. Where there is a stark
factual dispute that goes both to liability and whether the claim falls within a jurisdictional
gateway, a difficulty arises because there is a risk that an enquiry as to who has much the
better of the argument will lead to the Court forming a view, at the interlocutory stages,
on the merits of an issue properly to be resolved at trial, when more extensive evidence
will have become available.51 In the decisions in Crociani, Dick and Heinrichs the issue was
whether the case was within rule 7(j) gateway, in particular Article 5(a) of the Trusts (­ Jersey)
Law 1984 in circumstances where the proper law of the trust had purported to have been
changed from Jersey to the proper law of another jurisdiction where the purported exercise
of that power was, in the proceedings, subject to a challenge as being a fraud on the power
and therefore void.52 In those cases, it has been held that the Court is entitled to enquire
whether, on the basis of the written evidence relied upon by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has
the better of the argument on the issue of the proper law of the trusts to allow the Court to
take jurisdiction under Article 5(a).53

53 It is to be noted that in each case there was no opposing cogent evidence that the power to change the proper
law was properly exercised. While it has not been determined, the 'better of the argument' test suggests that where
the Court is presented with an apparently evenly balanced case as to whether, on the merits, the plaintiff has a
good arguable case that the claim falls within a gateway, the Court would err on the side of caution and decline
to allow service-out.

Conflict of Law Issues

If the applicability of the pleaded facts to a jurisdictional gateway depends on a question of
law or construction, there is usually no room for the application of the test of good arguable
case.54 Where no controversial or developing area of law is in play, the Court will usually
have to determine the question on the application.55

ii. A Serious Issue to be Tried
2-24

2-25

The plaintiff must also demonstrate that there is a serious issue of fact or law to be tried
on the merits in respect of each cause of action for which leave to serve-out is sought. It is
not the practice of the Royal Court at an interlocutory hearing that is often heard only on
affidavits and before disclosure of evidence to try and determine issues of fact in assessing
whether there is a serious issue to be tried.56 The onus is on the plaintiff and the defendant
is entitled to put the plaintiff to proof (to the standard of a serious issue to be tried and not
the balance of probabilities) of its case.57 It is of course open to the defendant to show that
the evidence of the plaintiff is incomplete or plainly wrong.
The arbitrage between the different standards of proof (as between whether there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits and whether there is a good arguable case that a jurisdictional gateway has been engaged) was considered in the English case of Cecil and Ors
v Bayat and Ors,58 which has not yet been considered in Jersey. In that case, Hamblen J
observed that it is necessary to consider whether an ingredient for a cause of action is also
part of what must be established for jurisdictional purposes. If so, the lower standard of
proof (ie serious question to be tried) is subsumed into the higher standard of a good arguable case, and the separate question of whether there is a serious issue to be tried on the
merits becomes irrelevant.59 The logic in this position is that respective thresholds of good
arguable case and serious question to be tried are directed at different issues. The former
is concerned with whether the cause of action pleaded comes within one of the gateways;
the latter is concerned with whether that cause of action as pleaded is sound. Where the
ingredients of a cause of action are established to the standard of a good arguable case, to
then go on to consider whether the same ingredients give rise to a serious question to be
tried is, at best, a waste of time.

Jurisdiction

87

the Court that Jersey, rather than any other jurisdiction, is clearly the most appropriate
forum or forum conveniens in which to bring the proceedings.

i. Relevant Principles
The Royal Court has approved and adopted the relevant principles in a forum application
as being those stated in The Spiliada.60 The overarching question for the Court is this: in
which forum can the case be tried more suitably for the interests of all parties and for the
ends of justice?61 That question applies as equally to applications to serve-out as it does to
applications for a stay of Jersey proceedings on grounds of forum non conveniens.62 A plaintiff must show not only that Jersey is the appropriate forum but that it is clearly the appropriate forum although the plaintiff does not have to show that justice cannot be achieved
in an alternative forum or cannot be achieved save at excessive cost, delay or inconvenience.
In deciding which jurisdiction is 'most suitable', the Court must consider to which jurisdiction the action (meaning the issues in the action) has the most real and substantial
connection63 by reference to the following connecting factors: convenience, expense, the
availability of witnesses, the availability of documents and other evidence, the location of
any assets in dispute, the governing law of any relevant transaction, whether trusts and or
companies involved in the dispute are administered within or without the jurisdiction64 and
the place where the parties reside or carry on their business.65 It has also been stated that the
Court is looking for connecting factors to the jurisdiction which can include the governing
law of the issues.66 The jurisdiction in which a company is incorporated is prima facie the
forum conveniens for an action against a director of that company for breach of fiduciary
duty, regardless of where the alleged breach was committed or loss was sustained.67 It was
asserted in Re A Trust, B v C68 (no argument having been taken) that the Royal Court has
jurisdiction under Article 5 to decide whether a transfer of property to trustees of a Jersey
law governed trust should be set aside as having been made under a mistake on the basis
that the transfer was governed by Jersey law. Where the purported exercise of a power to
change the proper law of a Jersey trust to the law of another jurisdiction is subject to a challenge the Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the exercise of that power should be
set aside on the basis of the formal and/or substantive defect in its purported exercise on
the basis that its exercise was governed by principles of Jersey trust law.69 Where the application is under Jersey's statutory codification of the principles by which a transaction can
be set aside under mistake or the Hastings Bass principle in Articles 47C-J, the Court must
have jurisdiction under Article 5. It should be noted that the jurisdiction that exists under

Article 47C-J may not be exercised in respect of trusts that do not have Jersey law as their
governing law.70
The determination of forum conveniens is an exercise of evaluation and not a general
­discretion.71 The Court of Appeal will only overturn the Royal Court on a forum application if it took account of irrelevant factors; failed to take account of relevant factors; or its
conclusion was otherwise unreasonable.72

ii. Relationship between the Jurisdictional Gateways and whether
Jersey is the forum conveniens
2-30

2-31

Seconsar Far East Ltd v Bank Markazi Iran73 considered the relationship between the standard of proof on the existence of the cause of action and the principle of forum conveniens;
the two elements are separate and distinct. A particularly strong case on the merits cannot
compensate for a weak case as to whether Jersey is clearly the most appropriate forum for
the dispute. Neither can a very strong connection with Jersey as a forum justifying serviceout if the claim is weak on the merits, if a stronger case on the merits would otherwise be
required. The need to establish Jersey as forum conveniens springs from an anxiety that
great care should be taken in dragging a foreigner before the Royal Court. Only if the Court
has power to serve-out within rule 7 and it is also established that Jersey is clearly the most
appropriate forum is there no good reason why any particular degree of cogency should be
required in relation to the merits of the plaintiff 's case.
Rule 7 is drafted to be read disjunctively but proceedings may fall at the same time within
more than one of the gateways. Thus a claim for a constructive trust falls within the definition of trust for the purpose of rule 7(j) as coming within Article 5 of the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984 as well as rule 7(q).74 But if proceedings fall within one or more of the gateways
it is not permissible to give leave to serve-out on another cause of action which does not
fall within the gateway relied upon. It has been held that where leave to serve out of the
jurisdiction is based on only one cause of action it cannot be treated as permission based on
some other cause of action; nor, if a claim has been put forward on one legal basis, can the
plaintiff subsequently justify permission on another legal basis. Thus having permission for
one claim cannot be used as an anchor for the plaintiff to then serve-out other proceedings
for which no jurisdictional gateway has been established or permission sought.75

E. Applications for Leave to Serve Proceedings out of the Jurisdiction

The procedure for seeking leave to serve proceedings before the Royal Court out of the
jurisdiction differs depending upon the type of originating process used. Where the proceedings are commenced by Representation, orders for service out of the jurisdiction

should be included in the prayer of the Representation itself. Rule 9 of the Service of Process
(Jersey) Rules 1994 requires an application for service-out to be supported by an affidavit.
The application cannot be made by summons as there are no extant proceedings in which
to issue a summons until the proceedings are properly constituted by leave being granted
and the proceedings served. The affidavit in support of the application is required to be
lodged with the Judicial Greffe at the same time as the Representation, which following the
procedure for tabling a billet in actions commenced by Order of Justice ie (no later than
midday) on the Thursday preceding the first Samedi Court hearing at which the Representation will first be called on.76 The application for service-out is made orally at the Samedi
Court hearing. As actions commenced by Representation are first presented to the Court
ex parte the representor is obliged to be full and frank in their application for service out of
the jurisdiction; bringing to the attention of the Court those matters which are, objectively,
relevant (whether in favour or against the application) to whether the discretion to serveout should be exercised.77 However, the fact that an affidavit in support of the application
may be in some way defective is not necessarily to invalidate the order made pursuant to it.
Whether to set aside service will depend upon the facts of each case and will include any
prejudice to the defendant served, the extent and effect of the non-disclosure and whether,
notwithstanding the defect there were clearly valid grounds for leave to serve-out.78
Where the proceedings are commenced by Order of Justice, save where the gateway relied
upon is rule 7(b),79 the application to serve the Order of Justice out of the jurisdiction is
made ex parte in writing to the Judicial Greffier (sitting as Master) who will usually make
a decision on the basis of the affidavit in support of the application without the need for a
hearing.

i. The Affidavit in Support of an Application to Serve out of the Jurisdiction
The affidavit in support is usually sworn by the advocate of the party making the ­application.
The affidavit must state that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of
action, and showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found,
and the grounds upon which the application is made.80 The contents of the affidavit in support are prescribed by PD RC15/01. The affidavit should:

state the belief of the deponent that there is a good cause of action-it should be sufficiently full to show that the plaintiff has a good arguable case for the relief claimed;

Conflict of Law Issues

The non-exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account by the Court in exercising its
discretion to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdiction are set out in the decision of the
Royal Court in James Capel (C.I.) Limited v Koppel And Fenchurch Trust Limited81 and the
House of Lords in Seaconsar.82 Doubt as to the application should be resolved in favour of
the party sought to be joined to the proceedings.83
If leave to serve-out is granted, the plaintiff is required to make arrangements to serve the
Act of Court granting leave, the proceedings, the summons (the form of which is prescribed
by the Service of Process Rules 1994)84 and the application for service out of the jurisdiction on the defendant.85 The Act of Court giving leave to effect service out of the jurisdiction must specify the date upon which such defendant is required (either in person or by
their advocate) to appear before the Royal Court. The return date is invariably a Friday
afternoon, coinciding with the usual weekly sitting of the Samedi division. In fixing a return
date the Court will allow sufficient time for service of the proceedings, for the defendant
to properly consider the proceedings, for the defendant to decide how it wishes to respond
and for the defendant to instruct Jersey counsel.86 Where the expiration of prescription is
imminent, a plaintiff seeking leave to serve out of the jurisdiction must give careful consideration to the timing necessary to make the application for leave, have it determined,
arrange to effect service of the proceedings abroad and table the proceedings for return
date on a Friday. While service of the proceedings will have the effect of pausing time from
running for the purposes of prescription87 if the proceedings are not tabled in time for the
return date given in the summons, time will begin to run again.88
In the case of a dispute under rather than against a trust, a jurisdiction clause in a trust
instrument that confers exclusive or non-exclusive jurisdiction on the Royal Court will normally but not invariably be decisive in favour of satisfaction of the requirement that Jersey is

84 A draft summons to be served outside Jersey can be found in app IV.
85 Personal service by a local process server or firm of lawyers is usually the Court's preferred method of service.
Where personal service is demonstrably not possible or impractical, the plaintiff may approach the Court for an
order for substituted service once personal service has been attempted and failed.
86 The Court is likely to be guided by, but is not bound to follow, the periods listed in CPR PD 6 (Service out
of the Jurisdiction).

the proper place in which to bring the claim, even though Jersey might not otherwise be the
natural forum. Conversely a plaintiff is likely to face an uphill battle to persuade the Royal
Court to give permission for service-out in a dispute under a trust if the trust instrument
contains a jurisdiction clause that confers jurisdiction (particularly exclusive jurisdiction)
on a foreign court, even if the foreign court might otherwise not be the natural forum. That
the trust is governed by Jersey law is but one factor (albeit one of some weight) towards the
Jersey court being the appropriate forum, and likewise a foreign governing law is a pointer
of some weight against, but this matter is not decisive on the issue of forum conveniens.
The loss of a limitation defence available in a foreign jurisdiction is a factor to be taken into
account in determining what are the ends of justice, but the Court may in a proper case
override the objections of the defendant to loss of such a defence, for instance where the
plaintiff has not been negligent in failing to commence proceedings in the foreign country
in time and the defendant has been astute not to mention the limitation issue to the plaintiff before time abroad expires.

A defendant who wishes to contest the jurisdiction of the Royal Court, either on the ground
that the case is not within one of the jurisdictional gateways, or that the case is not a proper
one for the exercise of the discretion, should, no later than 28 days after the proceedings
are placed on the pending list, issue a summons in the usual way seeking an order for a
declaration:89

declaring that the proceedings have not been duly served on that party;
discharging any earlier order giving leave to serve the proceedings on that party out of
the jurisdiction;
declaring that in the circumstances of the case the Court has no jurisdiction over that
party in respect of the subject matter of the claim or the relief or remedy sought in the
proceedings.

i. Applications for Stay on Grounds of forum non conveniens
2-41

A defendant served within or without the jurisdiction may apply for a stay of proceedings
on the ground that some foreign court, rather than the Royal Court, is the appropriate
forum for determination of the claim.93 An application to stay proceedings in Jersey on
grounds of forum non conveniens is not a dispute as to the Court's jurisdiction within the
scope of RCR 6/7(3) and therefore the time limits in that provision are i­napplicable.94
An application for a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens may be made at the same
time as an alternative to a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Royal Court. It should normally be made promptly after the close of pleadings but before the laying down of directions for trial and orders for discovery are made. It is not a bar to an application for a
stay on grounds of forum non conveniens for the applicant to have participated in the
­proceedings.95 There is no time limit to issue a summons for a stay although delay will be
an extremely significant factor in the Court refusing a stay.96 An application to stay proceedings in Jersey on grounds of forum non conveniens is essentially the reverse exercise of
that considered above in relation to service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction and
decisions on applications for a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens are relevant to a
plaintiff seeking leave to serve-out provided that it is remembered that both the question
and the burden of proof are reversed. The connecting factors above remain the same. On
an application to set aside an order granting leave to serve proceedings on a defendant out
of the jurisdiction, the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff to show (again but this time
on an inter partes basis) that Jersey was clearly the natural or appropriate forum in which
the case could be suitably tried in the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. On
an application for a stay of proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens, the burden
would fall on the defendant to show not only that Jersey is not the natural or appropriate
forum but also that there is another available forum which is distinctly more appropriate
than Jersey.97 The evidential burden will rest on the party who seeks to establish the existence of matters which will assist him in persuading the Court to exercise its discretion in
his favour. The burden of proof therefore depends entirely on the form of the application,
not on whether the defendant had been served as of right.98 It is open to a defendant to
issue a summons on two alternative grounds and, if he does so, the Court will consider
first the application to set aside, in respect of which the burden would fall on the plaintiff.
Although if the defendant's summons were to fail on that ground, he could hardly then
succeed on an application for a stay, whereas if he were to succeed, there would be no need
to consider a stay. In an application to stay proceedings, matters are to be considered as

93 Exceptionally, a defendant who has been served out of the jurisdiction may seek a stay on ground of forum
non conveniens, as where the defendant so served fails to pursue a challenge to the service-out, but is nonetheless
permitted by the Court to pursue an application for stay in conjunction with other defendants who have been
served within the jurisdiction; see Koonmen v Bender (n 64) at [23].

at the date of the hearing of the stay and may include relevant matters that have occurred
since the Court granted leave to serve-out.99
An important factor arising in relation to such an application is whether the forum contended for by the defendant forum is an available forum.100 In the trust context, it may, for
instance, be argued that the foreign court is not available, because the local judge in the foreign country concerned has heard a Beddoe application or is otherwise conflicted and cannot hear the substantive dispute. In reality, the availability of the foreign court only tends
to arise in the offshore world where the size of the alternative jurisdiction means it is only
able to draw upon a limited pool of judges. In situations where a dearth of non-conflicted
judges is a practical difficulty, it can easily be countered in the Beddoe context, if the procedural practice in the foreign court permits another judge to be brought in to determine the
substantive dispute.101 For many years Jersey has countered the apparent practical difficulty
of only having two permanent judges of the Royal Court by appointing Commissioners to
satisfy the need for extra capacity. A defendant seeking a stay is not obliged to agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the court contended for in the event a stay is granted, if he is not
otherwise amenable to that jurisdiction. Whether other defendants can be brought before
the foreign court, remains a relevant factor for the Court to consider in whether or not to
grant a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens.

2-42

a. Availability of the Foreign Jurisdiction
A foreign court will be considered to be available to a plaintiff if, by the time of the application for a stay, it would be open to him to institute proceedings against the defendant before
that court as of right.102 If this has only come about because the defendant has voluntarily
submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court then so be it. An alternative jurisdiction
will be considered to be available if a defendant undertakes to submit to that jurisdiction.103
However, no such undertaking is required in order for the defendant to argue that a distinctly more appropriate forum than Jersey exists.

2-43

b. Rebutting the prima facie Case for a Stay on Grounds of forum non conveniens
Where the Court concludes there is another available forum that prima facie is more appropriate than Jersey, the Court will normally grant a stay unless circumstances militate against
granting a stay, such as the plaintiff being unable to obtain justice in the foreign forum.104
If no available forum is more appropriate than Jersey then the Court will normally refuse
a stay.
A plaintiff who asserts they will be unable to obtain substantive or procedural justice in a
foreign forum must provide positive and cogent evidence that they are unlikely to receive

just treatment.105 This is properly to be regarded as part of the second limb of the Spiliada
test and not concerned with the availability of the foreign jurisdiction; once a prima facie
case for a stay has been made out, the burden is thrust back onto the party seeking to retain
Jersey as the forum conveniens. It is not appropriate for the Court to compare the quality of
justice obtainable in a foreign forum which adopts a different procedural system (such as
in civil law inquisitorial jurisdictions) with that obtainable in a similar case conducted in
the Royal Court.106 The mere existence of political difficulties in the foreign forum is usually insufficient in order for a stay to be refused. Something in the order of judiciary partiality, want of judicial independent or experience,107 the likelihood of excessive delay108
or the non-availability of an appropriate remedy is usually required.109 Where the foreign
jurisdiction's civil administration has utterly broken down, a stay in favour of the courts
of that place cannot practically be granted.110 In less extreme cases, where the plaintiff is
able to persuade the court that there is a risk111 that the foreign court will single out the
plaintiff or his claim for flagrantly unjust treatment, or that the foreign court is generally
and seriously unreliable, it now appears that the Court will not generally order a stay of
proceedings. The evidence required to support this contention need not be particular to
the plaintiff or his individual claim (though it may be more persuasive if it is), but may
be based on more general evidence of judicial failure or misconduct in relation to claims
of the type advanced by the plaintiff. A personal or juridical advantage to the plaintiff
in hearing a claim in Jersey is a relevant consideration for the Court if injustice would
be caused by depriving him of it by granting a stay although it is only one factor and may
be outweighed if keeping the claim in Jersey resulted in greater inconvenience and expense
and the Court is otherwise satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the available
appropriate foreign forum.112 Substantive differences between the recovery or other remedies available in Jersey and in the foreign court will not generally overcome the prima
facie case for a stay of proceedings.113 There is no presumption that a plaintiff is entitled to
win and therefore an argument that a stay should be refused and the plaintiff must be permitted to sue in Jersey because they will lose in a foreign court, has no weight. If practical
justice requires that a trial take place in Jersey because it is unrealistic to expect that it will
be possible to obtain a sensible hearing in the alternative forum, it is improbable that a stay
will be appropriate.114 Thus, if the plaintiff is able to obtain financial support for proceedings if they are brought in Jersey, but will be unable to obtain it, or a reasonable equivalent,
if the claim must be brought in the foreign court and will as a result be unable to sue at all,

it will rarely be just to grant a stay of the proceedings.115 Where a plaintiff would be forced
to bring proceedings in more than one jurisdiction because of a stay granted to one or
more of a number of defendants in Jersey, an argument resisting a stay could be sustained
on the basis that it would adversely affect the efficient conduct of litigation to run two or
more sets of proceedings with the attendant risk of inconsistent conclusions being reached
between the Jersey and foreign courts.116

ii. A Stay on the Basis of the Existence of Parallel Proceedings-lis alibi pendens
Where proceedings are already pending before a foreign court, and a second action is begun
in Jersey where the same issues are in dispute, the Court has a discretion to stay the Jersey
proceedings. Generally, the principles applicable are those considered above in connection
with forum conveniens. A foreign forum in which proceedings have already been initiated
is not necessarily the forum conveniens if a question of Jersey law is essential to resolution of dispute on the basis that a court applies its own law more reliably than does a foreign court.117 The existence of simultaneous proceedings elsewhere is but one factor to be
taken into account in the determination of the appropriate forum.118 As an alternative to
a stay, where the same plaintiff begins proceedings in more than one jurisdiction, he may
be required to elect which set of proceedings he wishes to pursue.119 The Court also retains
a general discretion to stay Jersey proceedings in order to await the outcome of a foreign
action. The Royal Court may also in certain circumstances120 grant an anti-suit injunction
restraining the bringing or continuance of foreign proceedings.121

G. Effect of a Jurisdiction Clauses in the Trust Instrument
While Jersey has historically looked to the law of England and Wales in matters of private
international law, the effect of a jurisdiction clause in a trust instrument is strictly a matter
of Jersey law and not the law of any other country or territory. Questions concerning the
effect of jurisdiction clauses most commonly arise either (1) in the context of a plaintiff 's
application for permission to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction, or an application
by the defendant to set aside such service;122 or (2) an application by a defendant to stay
proceedings served within the jurisdiction on grounds of forum non conveniens.

i. Jurisdiction Clauses
2-48

2-49

2-50

Before the Court is in a position to grapple with the effect of a jurisdiction clause in a
trust instrument, it must first determine whether the provision relied upon in the trust
instrument is in fact a jurisdiction clause. This is primarily a question of construction of
the specific formulation of words used.123 A trust governed by a law other than Jersey that
contains, or is alleged to contain, a jurisdiction clause, is to be construed in accordance with
the rules of construction of the governing law of the instrument.124 Having determined
whether the particular provision is a jurisdiction clause, the Court must then determine
whether it is exclusive or non-exclusive. Next the Court should consider the scope of the
jurisdiction clause and whether the particular matter in issue in the proceedings is within
its scope. Finally, the Court should ask, to the extent that the matter in question is within
its scope, which jurisdiction the clause in question provides for in relation to the matter
in question.
A very common formulation often found in professionally drafted trust instruments is that
a designated country, or its courts of that country, are to be 'the forum of administration'
(or the forum for the administration) of the trust.125 Where the formulation used is that
courts of 'X' country or territory are to be its forum of administration, the clause is likely
to be properly construed as jurisdiction clause.126 Where however the formulation is that
the country itself is said to be the forum of the administration of the trust,127 the clause
is more properly construed to point to the physical place where from which the trust is
administered.128
A provision alleged to be an exclusive jurisdiction clause that uses the formulation 'forum
of administration' may often be intertwined with a proper law provision that the law of 'X'
country should be the law 'to the exclusive jurisdiction of which' the rights of all parties
and the construction and effect of the provisions of the trust should be subject.129 Such
a formulation is, properly construed, a proper law clause and the reference to 'exclusive
­jurisdiction' a red herring.130

ii. Exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses versus Non-exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses
So far as construction is concerned, similar principles will apply to trust instruments as
in the case of contractual jurisdiction clause; the question is whether the clause obliges
the parties intended to be subject to it to resort to the relevant jurisdiction, irrespective of
whether the word 'exclusive' is used.131 It has been held that a jurisdiction clause that provides that the courts of X country 'shall' be 'the' forum of administration, is suggestive of
the clause being intended to confer exclusive jurisdiction. First, the use of imperative 'shall'
rather than more permissive language, and the use of the definite 'the' rather than indefinite
article 'a/an'. Accordingly, it has been held that such a clause is intended to confer exclusive
jurisdiction.132 However, both the Jersey Court of Appeal and the Privy Council in Crociani
did not follow Koonmen v Bender and the latter considered it was questionable whether the
use of the definite article 'the', in the forum stipulation was strong enough on its own to
confer exclusive jurisdiction on, in that case, the courts of Mauritius.133

2-51

iii. Matters Falling with the Scope of the Jurisdiction Clause
Again, what matters is what is within the scope of a particular jurisdiction clause as a matter
of construction. The formulation that 'the courts of 'X' country are the forum of administration of the trust' has given rise to ambiguity as to what falls within its scope. The expression 'forum of administration' is often used in a way where it is unclear whether the meaning is (1) courts with jurisdiction over administration; (2) law governing administration; or
(3) place where administration is carried on.134 In the view of the Jersey Court of Appeal the
concept of 'forum for the administration of the trust' refers to the locus of internal administration which can if necessary engage the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court rather than
of resolution of hostile litigation between beneficiaries and trustees, a fortiori between beneficiaries and ex-trustees.135 We do not consider that the phrase is co-extensive with those
matters that would fall within the scope of a court order for the administration of the trust
by the Court which is, even in England, an obsolete procedure and is unknown in Jersey.
'Forum for administration' refers to the locus of internal administration which can engage
the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court rather than the forum for the resolution of hostile
litigation between beneficiaries and trustees (including ex-trustees).136 'Forum for administration' is a different concept from an exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes.
The administration referred to does not include contentious breach of trust litigation but

aspects of the administration that would fall within the Court's supervisory jurisdiction
under which the Court may, on admittedly rare occasions, undertake the administration of
the trust itself.137 The suggestion, in Bender, that 'forum for administration' is ­necessarily
intended to confer an exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of contentious disputes
involving beneficiaries was incorrect.
While the term 'forum' may sometimes have a meaning associated with a court; it does not
always have that meaning. It may simply refer to the place where trusts are a­ dministered.138
Use of the term 'jurisdiction' in trust instruments should be approached with care.
­Jurisdiction may have two meanings: the jurisdiction or competence of the courts of a
particular country, ie the forum, as well as meaning 'scope or province of application' of the
governing law itself.

iv. Royal Court's Approach to Exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses
2-55

2-56

For many years, a debate has raged in a number of jurisdictions as to whether the court
should give effect to a jurisdiction clause in a trust instrument in the same way it would
approach such a clause in a contractual agreement.139 As the Privy Council in Crociani
observed, not all of these decisions are mutually consistent with one another in their construction of various clauses purporting to be jurisdiction clauses or their effect. In a contractual context, the Royal Court normally gives effect to a jurisdiction clause for the simple
reason that it has been agreed to by the parties, and the parties should be held to what they
have agreed.140 Analogous reasoning may apply in trust cases as between the original parties who executed the trust instrument containing the jurisdiction clause.141 However, the
contractual analogy cannot necessarily be applied where the trustee may not be the original
trustees to the trust instrument and in the case of beneficiaries, the basis upon which they
can be taken to have agreed to anything is unclear.
The debate as to whether the same approach that applied to a contractual exclusive jurisdiction clause as stated authoritatively by Donohue v Armco Ltd,142 applied equally to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a deed of trust, has been decided emphatically in the negative
by the Privy Council in Crociani & Ors v Crociani & Ors.143 In that case, a clause in a trust
instrument (which the trustee contended was an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of
Mauritius) gave the trustees the power to appoint new trustees in another jurisdiction and
to declare that the trust shall be read and take effect according to the laws of the country of
the residence or incorporation of the new trustees. If this power was exercised, the critical
part of the clause went on to provide that:
thereafter the rights of all persons and the construction and effect of each and every provision hereof shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of and construed only according to

the law of the said country which shall become the forum for the administration of the trusts
hereunder.144

The Jersey Court of Appeal held that the reference to 'exclusive jurisdiction' did not make
the courts of Mauritius the only locus in which disputes from the time of the appointment
of the fourth appellant, Appleby Mauritius, could be resolved. Rather it meant that the
governing law applied to all aspects of the trust. The reference to 'the forum for the administration of the trusts hereunder' did not make the courts of Mauritius from that time the
only locus in which such disputes could be resolved; it merely referred to the place where
the trust was to be administered. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of
the Royal Court below that in the alternative, there were exceptional circumstances which
justified it in overriding the so-called exclusive jurisdiction clause, if it had taken effect.
In Koonmen v Bender,145 the Jersey Court of Appeal had previously construed the term
'forum for administration' in a jurisdiction dispute (where the contest lay between Jersey
and Anguilla) as conferring jurisdiction on the courts of Anguilla for contentious trusts
disputes. The decision in Koonmen v Bender has attracted criticism, most notably from
Professor Paul Matthews.146 The Privy Council and Court of Appeal in Crociani have now
endorsed the validity of this criticism. The forum for administration of a trust and the
forum for the resolution of disputes relating to it need not be the same.147 Crociani makes
clear that it considers Koonmen to have been incorrectly decided on this point. The
draftsman's intention in Koonmen (objectively construed) in using the words 'forum for
­administration' was not to alter the forum for hostile trust litigation but simply the forum
for matters of administration.
The Board in Crociani was unanimously of the opinion that in the case of a trust deed, the
weight to be given to an exclusive jurisdiction clause was less than the weight to be given
to such a clause in a contract. Given that a balancing exercise is involved, this test could
be expressed by saying that the strength of the case that needs to be made out to avoid the
enforcement of such a clause is less great where the clause is in a trust deed. In the case of
a trust clause, the Court is not faced with the argument that it should hold a contracting
party to her contractual bargain. It is, of course, true that a beneficiary, who wishes to take
advantage of a trust can be expected to accept that she is bound by the terms of the trust,
but it is not a commitment of the same order as a contracting party being bound by the
terms of a commercial contract. Where it is a beneficiary who wishes to avoid the clause and
trustees who wish to rely on it, one would normally expect the trustees to come up with a
good reasons for adhering to the clause, albeit that their failure to do so would not prevent
them from invoking the presumption that the clause should be enforced.148 In the case of
a trust, unlike a contract, the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to supervise the administration of the trust.149 This is not to suggest that a court has some freewheeling unfettered

discretion to do whatever seems fair when it comes to trusts. However, what is clear is that
the Court does have a power to supervise the administration of trusts, primarily to protect
the interests of beneficiaries, which represents a clear and, for present purposes, significant
distinction between trusts and contracts. Accordingly, the Board considered that, while it
was right to confirm that a trustee is prima facie entitled to insist on and enforce an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a trust deed, the weight to be given to the existence of the clause
is less (or the strength of the arguments needed to outweigh the effect of the clause is less)
than where one contracting party is seeking to enforce a contractual exclusive jurisdiction
clause against another contracting party. The Privy Council considered it right to mention
that many cases (including the Jersey authorities EMM Capricorn Trustees Ltd v Compass
Trustees Ltd150 and Koonmen v Bender151) seem to have assumed that the weight to be given
was the same. However, the Board considered that the issue was not fully discussed or considered in any of those cases, which were in any event not binding on the Board and ought
now to be regarded as superseded as statements of the law in Jersey.

v. Relevance of a Jurisdiction Clause to Applications to Serve-out
2-60

In applications to serve out of the jurisdiction, the existence of a clause in a trust instrument
conferring jurisdiction on the courts of Jersey is not in and of itself one of the grounds for
service out of the jurisdiction,152 and so the plaintiff will be unable, even if the trust instrument contains such a clause, to effect service unless the claim falls within at least one of the
jurisdictional gateways, or the defendant submits to the jurisdiction, or it becomes possible
to effect service within the jurisdiction. Of course where service is possible through one of
these gateways, reliance on the jurisdiction clause is unnecessary. The potential relevance of
a jurisdiction clause, in an application to serve-out, is that it may be deployed in aid of an
application for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction, where the clause confers jurisdiction on the courts of Jersey. The decisions in Crociani are clear that a jurisdiction clause
in a trust instrument does not negative the Court's discretion in determining whether permission should be granted for service-out. A jurisdiction clause conferring non-exclusive
jurisdiction on the Royal Court will aid an application for permission to serve-out (or to
resist an application for a stay of proceedings served within the jurisdiction). A jurisdiction clause conferring non-exclusive jurisdiction on the court of another country has less
impact than one conferring exclusive jurisdiction, since, being non-exclusive, Jersey proceedings are not an affront to or inconsistent with the terms of the clause. Generally, the
matter is determined in accordance with principles of forum non conveniens, though even a
non-exclusive jurisdiction clause raises a rebuttable presumption that the designated forum
is forum conveniens.153 However, for the Court to give leave to serve proceedings out of the
jurisdiction in the face of a clause conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the court of another
country would require very special circumstances.154

Jurisdiction

101

Conversely, a jurisdiction clause may also be deployed in aid of an application challenging
the jurisdiction of the Court, even where the claim falls within one of the jurisdictional
gateways, where the clause confers jurisdiction on a foreign court. A jurisdiction clause may
be deployed in aid of an application to stay the proceedings, where the clause confers jurisdiction on a foreign court, or indeed to resist such an application where the clause confers
jurisdiction on the Jersey court.
Where there a multiple defendants, some of whom successfully apply to set aside service
out of the jurisdiction, or to stay proceedings served within the jurisdiction, in reliance
on an exclusive jurisdiction clause, but there remain some defendants upon whom service
has been effective with such service having not been successfully set aside the Court may
stay the proceedings as a whole so that they do not continue even against the inactive
defendants, unless they apply to lift the stay.155

vi. Relevance of Jurisdiction Clauses on Claims against the Trust
We have thus far considered the impact of a jurisdiction clause in a dispute under a trust.
Different considerations apply where the plaintiff is an outsider to the trust asserting a
claim against the trust assets. In those circumstances the analogy with jurisdiction clauses
in a contractual context completely breaks down as, being a stranger to the trust, there is no
reason why the plaintiff should be bound or affected by the terms of a trust against which
he claims. In such claims, a jurisdiction clause, whether exclusive or non-exclusive, has
no direct significance as a jurisdiction clause.156 Nonetheless, the clause may be indirectly
significant to the question of appropriate forum, in that any Beddoe application the trustee
brings as to what to do about the claim will, prima facie, need to be brought in the jurisdiction designated by the jurisdiction clause, and since one of the matters to be considered in
a Beddoe application, in a context in which the trustee's right to be indemnified from the
trust fund may be compromised, is whether beneficiaries should be added as parties to the
main action, it may be expedient for the main action also to be brought in the same jurisdiction as the Beddoe hearing.157

2-63

vii. Powers in the Trust Instrument Changing the Judicial Forum of the Trust
It is not uncommon for a Jersey law governed trust to contain a provision designating a
country (usually Jersey) to be the judicial forum of administration of the trust and to also
contain a power conferred upon the trustees to change the judicial forum, sometimes coupled with a change in the governing law. Such a power is plainly, in the absence of special
wording to the contrary, a fiduciary power to be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries as a whole.158 A self-serving change of judicial forum that is calculated to hinder a
personal claim by beneficiaries against the trustees would be liable to be challenged as void
as a fraud on a power.159 The exercise of such a power may also be subject to challenge as

being formally defective.160 In a case where a change in the judicial forum is contemplated
so as to protect the trust from external attack, trustees face the difficulty that the court in
the present jurisdiction (in which the power is exercised) is not likely to be the court that
the trustees would wish to approach for directions, but if they make the change it is then too
late for the trustees to seek directions in the new jurisdiction as the forum for the administration will have changed.

A. Hague Trust Convention
2-65

2-66

The Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition or simply
the Hague Trust Convention is a multilateral treaty developed by the Hague Conference on
Private International Law on the Law Applicable to Trusts. It concluded on 1 July 1985 and
entered into force as between the signatories to it on 1 January 1992. The purpose of the
Convention is to harmonise the conflict of laws rules applicable to trusts and to provide a
harmonised framework for the recognition of trusts falling within its scope. The United
Kingdom is a signatory to the Convention which was incorporated into UK law almost
wholesale as a schedule to the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987. The Act came into force in
the UK on 1 August 1987. Section 2(2) of the 1987 Act provides that the Queen in Council
may extend the provisions of the Act to any of the Crown Dependencies or colony, however
the Act was not expressly extended to Jersey.

The explanatory report of Professor Alfred E von Overbeck, that accompanies the text of
the Convention, is recognised as an authority as to the meaning of each article. This is a
particularly useful interpretive document in Jersey in the absence of any domestic legislation or reported cases stating what the provisions of the Convention mean.

2-67

i. Jersey and the Hague Trust Convention
An understanding of the Hague Trust Convention is important for any party involved in
cross-border trust litigation in Jersey. The Royal Court may assume jurisdiction over a trust
which is governed by Jersey law.177 Jersey law draws a statutory distinction between trusts
governed by the law of Jersey and trusts governed by foreign law. In a bid to limit outside
interference with Jersey law trusts, Jersey's Trusts Law178 prohibits the application of conflict of laws rules (including those in the Hague Convention) to a broad range of matters
relevant to a Jersey law trust, set out in Article 9(1). In other words, the Convention is only
relevant to the litigation of trust disputes in Jersey to the extent that the trust which is the
subject of the dispute has a foreign law. The Hague Trust Convention therefore comprehensively sets out the choice of law rules applicable to non-Jersey law trusts for the Bailiwick
but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no reported decisions of the Royal Court that apply
the Hague Trust Convention.179
There is no domestic legislation on Jersey's statute book that incorporates the Convention
into Jersey's domestic law in a similar fashion to the 1987 Act. Jersey, like the UK, operates a
dualist system whereby international treaties to which Jersey accedes are not automatically
adopted into the domestic law of the island unless expressly incorporated by local legislation. The domestic legislation that was said to harmonise Jersey's conflict of laws rules as
to trusts with the Convention was the Trusts (Amendment No 2) (Jersey) Law 1991. This
­legislation came into force on 1 March 1992. Strictly speaking, the Trusts (Amendment No 2)
(Jersey) Law 1991 does not actually import any part of the Convention into Jersey law.
What is now Article 4 of the 1984 Trust Law, that governs the determination of the proper
law of a trust, is an approximation of Articles 5 to 7 of the Convention, albeit one that
closely follows the wording therein.
That gives rise to a curious situation in which there is apparently no legal mechanism by
which the Royal Court may give effect to the rest of the Convention. The Preamble to the
Trusts (Amendment No 2) (Jersey) Law 1991 states that the Law is enacted in order to
173 Entering into force on 1 January 1992 in Bermuda, British Antarctic Territories, the BVI, the Falkland
Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey (extended by an Order in Council on 28 April 1993), the Isle of Man, Monserrat,
St Helena, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the Turks & Caicos Islands (as of 1 July 1993).

176 On 13 June 1988.
177 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 5.
178 ibid, Article 9(3A).
179 This may be reflective of the general disinclination of the Royal Court to assume jurisdiction over a trust
whose foreign law is elsewhere.

facilitate the extension of the Convention to the island. As the scheme of the Convention is
to provide a harmonised baseline for the rules for determining the law applicable to trusts,
the States of Jersey's failure to import the rest of the Convention into Jersey law when given
the opportunity must be taken as it being implicit that Jersey's conflict of laws rules pertaining to trusts were already largely compliant with the Convention and required no further
amendment (other than the 1991 Law) in order to make them so.
There is very little documented evidence as to what Jersey's conflicts of laws rules pertaining to trusts were prior to the commencement of the Convention. Brown180 suggests that
the common approach of the Royal Court was to apply the then prevailing English conflict
of laws rules to Jersey. These rules were supplanted by the 1987 Act but that legislation
was enacted only to give effect to the Convention and it is not necessarily indicative of a
wholesale revision of what was in place before. Laurence Collins J in Chelleram v Chelleram
(No 2)181 indicated his view that there was no significant difference between England and
Wales' conflict of laws rules before and after the enactment of the Convention.
It may be that Jersey's customary law provides an answer as to how the Royal Court is able
to give effect to the Convention even though it is has not been expressly incorporated into
Jersey's law. As the basis for legal authority in Jersey is long usage and practice, the collective assumption that the Hague Convention in its entirety applies as a matter of domestic
law in Jersey might be sufficient to elevate that assumption into a rule the Court would be
prepared to follow. If this hypothesis is correct it must therefore follow that Jersey's conflict
of laws rules applicable to trusts are co-extensive with the scope of the Convention. It also
follows that the extensions to the Convention made by the UK Parliament in the Recognition of Trust Acts 1987182 do not apply to Jersey because that legislation was never extended
to the island by an Order in Council.

ii. Recognition of Trusts
2-73

The Royal Court may assume jurisdiction over a trust whose proper law is not that of Jersey.
A trust which demonstrates the characteristics in Article 2 and meets the requirements in
Article 3 and is governed by the law of a state that recognises trusts is entitled to recognition
in Jersey qua trust under Article 11 even if as a matter of domestic Jersey trust law, it would
not be considered a trust. Article 11 is designed for the recognition of foreign law trusts in
states in which the trust is not a domestic legal institution. As Jersey is a well-developed
trust jurisdiction, Article 11 adds little if anything to Jersey's law that it would not already
understand.

iii. The Effect of the Convention in States that Do Not Recognise Trusts
2-74

The Convention does not have the effect of introducing the concept of the common law
trust (with its equitable proprietary trappings) into the domestic law of states which do not
180

182 eg s 1(2) provides that the provisions of the Convention shall, so far as applicable, have effect not only in
relation to the trusts described in Arts 2 and 3 of the Convention (which confine the Convention only to trusts
created voluntarily and evidenced in writing) but also in relation to any other trusts of property arising under the
law of any part of the UK or by virtue of a judicial decision whether in the UK or elsewhere.
181

Choice of Governing or Proper Law

105

recognise trusts. The Convention merely requires those non-trust states to recognise trusts
that fall within the scope of the Convention for the purposes of private international law
only. While this does not require a non-trust state to swallow the concept of a trust wholesale, it does require them to recognise a diluted or 'trust light' concept of a segregated fund
(or fiduciary patrimony) immune from the claims of the owner's creditors and heirs.183

iv. Temporal Application of the Convention
Article 22 provides that the Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which
they were created but permits a contracting state to reserve the right not to apply the Convention to trusts created before the date on which the Convention enters into force in relation to that State. In the UK, section 1(5) of the 1987 Act provides that Article 22 was not
to be construed as affecting the law to be applied in relation to anything done or omitted
before the coming into force of the Act. The effect of that provision is that breaches of
trust committed before the commencement of the UK legislation (1 August 1987) are to
be determined by the law applicable according to the common law conflict of laws rules
then applying to trusts. It is said that section 1(5) was enacted out of an abundance of
­caution but it is consistent with the recorded position of the United Kingdom at the Hague
­Conference184 that Article 22 having any retroactive effect would only be objectionable if it
altered the substantive law pertaining before the Convention entered into force, which in
the case of the United Kingdom, it is not thought to do.185 The 1987 Act does not apply to
Jersey, neither has Jersey made use of the reservation procedure and it must therefore be
assumed that the Royal Court will apply the Convention to trusts regardless of the date on
which they were created.

2-75

v. Types of Trust Falling within the Scope of the Convention
The Convention seeks to lay down the key characteristics of a trust but is not an exhaustive
statement, much less a definition of a trust. The diverse nature of the Convention required
a description that would encompass a range of legal institutions within its scope. The Convention is not limited to the trust as understood by the common law and covers analogous
institutions in civil law jurisdictions which exhibit certain core characteristics of a trust and
which are to be recognised as 'trusts' for the purposes of the Convention.
The trust is described as a legal relationship created inter vivos or on death by a person, the
settlor, when assets have been placed under the control of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary or for a specified purpose.186 The Convention can therefore apply to non-charitable
purpose trusts (which are recognised as a matter of Jersey law) even though such trusts are
invalid in certain other jurisdictions.187 It is to be noted that Article 2 does not include the

183 See Arts 2(2)(a) and 11 of the Convention. The adoption of the Convention by Luxembourg, Switzerland
and Italy was accompanied by reforming legislation to accommodate the concept of a separate patrimony.

Conflict of Law Issues

fiduciary nature of trusteeship as an essential characteristic of a trust because 'fiduciary' is
not a term that can be easily translated meaningfully into civilian legal language.
It is doubtful whether a unilateral declaration of trust, where a settlor declares himself to be
a trustee of assets that are appropriated to be held so and transferring assets from his silo
of private property to his fiduciary silo, can be said to amount to placing assets under the
control of a trustee.
Provided the trust is properly created188 there seems to be no principled reason why a unilateral declaration of trust by the settlor (in contrast with a transfer to a trustee) should not
be brought within the applicable law and recognition provision of the Convention. Article
2(2)(a) provides that a trust will not be a trust for the purposes of the Convention where
the legal ownership and beneficial ownership of property are part of the trustee's patrimony, so as to be available for the trustee's creditors.
Article 2(2)(b) provides that title to the trust assets need not been vested in the trustee for
the assets to be subject to a trust within the meaning of the Convention, provided that the
assets are held in the name of another person to hold on behalf of the trustee.189
Article 2(2)(c) provides that a trustee is subject to any obligations specified in the trust
instrument, and also to duties imposed on him by law. Omitted from this provision is
to whom the trustee owes his obligation. As a matter of Jersey orthodoxy, the trustee is
accountable to the beneficiaries (or the Attorney General in the case of charitable purpose
trusts) although were the Royal Court to consider a foreign law trust where the duty is owed
to the settlor or an enforcer, this would not prevent the trust from being a trust for the purposes of the Convention and capable of recognition in Jersey.190
The final paragraph of Article 2 recognises that a trustee may himself be a beneficiary of a
trust (although not the sole beneficiary of which he is the trustee as it is not possible to owe
duties to himself). Trusts that provide for wide reserve rights and powers to the settlor are
still 'trusts' within the meaning of the Convention although it is not specified what rights
and powers are permitted. One runs the risk that while the assets remain vested in the trustee but within the effective control of the settlor,191 the trust may be regarded as a sham in
some jurisdictions192 and held not for the beneficiaries at all but for the settlor.

vi. Evidenced in Writing
2-83

The Convention applies only to trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing.193
A trust that is declared orally will fall within the scope of the Convention if it is subsequently evidenced in writing. A trust will be sufficiently evidenced in writing even if such

188 Which is a matter falling outside the scope of the Convention under Art 4, see paras 2-90 below.

189 Underhill and Hayton, Law of Trusts and Trustees, 18th edn (London, Lexis Nexis, 2010) at para 100.57 are
of the view that Art 2(2)(b) is not wide enough to encompass the concept of an agency or mandate with control
over property within the Convention definition of 'trust'.
190 Although a trustee who owes a duty solely to the settlor risks being considered a sham unless some obligations are also owed to the beneficiaries as well.
191 Note the extensive menu of reserve powers under the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 9A.

Choice of Governing or Proper Law

107

writing is not signed by the settlor194 although 'evidenced in writing' must be taken to mean
­sufficiently evidenced to represent the will of the settlor to create the trust in those terms. By
section 1(2) of the 1987 Act, the UK has made the scope of Article 3 of the Convention academic in the UK.195 However, Jersey is not subject to section 1(2) and therefore some consideration of what trusts fall within and without Article 3 is appropriate and necessary. A trust
that satisfies the formality requirements will continue to come within the Convention even
if it is later affected by a court decision that replaces the original trustee or varies the trust196
or if the assets of the trust vary over time. It is unclear whether an addition to an existing
trust that already comes within Article 3 requires to be evidenced in writing as well. Erring
on the side of caution it is suggested that there should be some writing by a settlor indicating
his intention that the transferee should hold the additional assets as an accretion to the trust.

vi. Trusts Created Voluntarily
The concept of a trust created voluntarily is fairly open-textured and does not translate well
into the lexicon of trust lawyers because of the questions it leaves surrounding resulting and
constructive trusts (which share characteristics of being an imposed solution by the court
in the nature of a remedy197 as well as being capable of analysis on the basis of an implicit
intention).198 Both resulting and constructive trusts arise by operation of law or presumed
or implied intention rather than voluntary creation in the sense of an express trust. The
intention of the drafters of the Convention appears to have been to use a language that provided sufficient flexibility for extending the scope of the Convention while it was allowed
to bed-down but which prima facie excluded from its scope constructive trusts imposed by
the courts.199 Resulting trusts arising from the failure of an express trust should be covered
by the Convention.200 Where a constructive or resulting trust can be analysed as arising as a
response to the acts and free will of a settlor and the trustee, such trusts can legitimately be
brought within the scope of 'voluntary trusts' for the purposes of the Convention.

2-84

a. Resulting Trusts
A resulting trust that arises from the failure of an express trust which fails to exhaust the
beneficial interests in the trust fund, and is evidenced in writing must fall within the scope
of the Convention.201 It is logical that the governing law of an express trust should also govern its failure and determine the effect of such failure as giving rise to a resulting trust.202

Or in fact signed by any particular party; signing is not a requirement of Art 3.
Section 1(2) provides: 'Those provisions [of the Convention] shall, so far as applicable, have effect not only
in relation to the trusts described in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention but also in relation to any other trusts of
property arising under the law of any part of the United Kingdom or by virtue of a judicial decision whether in
the United Kingdom or elsewhere'.

Conflict of Law Issues

It is unclear whether the Convention can be read as encompassing a purchase-money
­resulting trust. It can be argued that such a trust is created voluntarily in the sense that is
can be presumed to reflect the settlor's (contributor's) intention by contributing to the purchase price. The difficulty comes in whether such a resulting trust is evidenced in writing. It
is an open question as to whether a court declaring the terms of a resulting trust can be said
to amount, in itself, to sufficient evidence in writing so as to bring an otherwise undocumented purchase-money resulting trust within the terms of Article 3. While it might seem
an acute point, one can imagine circumstance where the recognition of such a trust might
have to be sought from the courts of a non-trust or civilian jurisdiction. It must be remembered that the open-textured language of the Convention can be derided or deployed to
one's advantage and where a clear unjust enrichment would result from non-recognition
of an undocumented purchase-money resulting trust, a more flexible gloss may need to be
applied to the language in Article 3.
b. Constructive Trusts
2-86

2-87

2-88

2-89

A personal remedy to account as a constructive trustee imposed upon a third party involved
in a breach of an express trust is not a trust for the purposes of Article 3 since the Convention is drafted so as to be concerned only with trusts of specific property as a ring-fenced
fund.203
The constructive trust imposed upon an trustee of an express trust (voluntarily created and
evidenced in writing) who appropriates trust assets to himself in breach of trust204 is properly to be considered as being one and the same as (or incidental to) the original express
trust coming within the terms of the Convention. This is a logical and necessary extension
of the protection afforded by the ring-fence in Article 2. The notion of the ring-fence would
be wholly illusory if it were possible for the trustee to take assets outside the ring-fence and
appropriate them to himself. Indeed Article 11(d) requires it to be possible to recover trust
assets from the trustee if he has mingled trust assets with his own property or has alienated
trust assets.
Where the trustee in breach of trust transfers trust assets to a third party (the third party
not being a bona fides purchaser for value and so no providing anything in substitution for
the trust assets) the effect of such a transfer is determined according to the choice of law
rules of the forum205 which will normally designate the lex situs as the governing law. While
a common law or mixed common and customary law jurisdiction will find the third party
bound by the prior equitable proprietary interests of the beneficiaries and so a constructive trustee of the property, other jurisdictions that do not recognise the beneficiaries' prior
proprietary equitable rights will not find such a constructive trust and are not obliged to do
so under the Convention.
Article 3 does appear to exclude a constructive trust arising against a person who is
not a trustee but does hold a fiduciary position who misappropriates to himself assets

belonging to his principal, such as a company director vis-à-vis his company. On this basis,
a ­constructive trust imposed on a fiduciary arising from the no-profit rule would also seem
to fall outside the Convention. In both of these circumstances the trusts are not created
voluntarily206 nor evidenced in writing but are imposed by the Court as a mechanism to
preserve the fiduciary's duty of fidelity.

vii. Preliminary Matters Excluded from the Scope of the Convention
The Convention applies only to matters which concern the validity of the trust itself. For a
trust to be brought into existence it must be validly declared and constituted, any written
instrument must itself be valid both as to form and substance and the subject matter of the
trust must be validly transferred into the hands of the trustee. Valid creation also touches
upon the capacity of the settlor. These are all 'preliminary matters' falling within Article 4
which excludes them from the scope of the Convention. Professor David Hayton first introduced the instructive analogy of a rocket (the trust) and a rocket launcher (the constitutive
acts that create the trust)207 but it is sometimes difficult to delineate precisely between the
launcher and the rocket. The distinction is best made between those rules applicable to any
disposition of property (the launcher) and those which specifically affect the ability to create a trust (the rocket).208 Thus, the transfer of property by the settlor to a trustee, the validity of a will (as to both its form and substance) and the capacity of the settlor are outside
the scope of the Convention.

2-90

a. Capacity of the Settlor
There is very little cogent authority on the choice of law rules governing the settlor's capacity to create a trust. The capacity to create a trust is itself comprised to two elements: the
capacity of the settlor to alienate property at all and the capacity of the settlor to subject
property to a trust. Since the alienation of property affects the title to the property and that
any decision on capacity should be enforceable in the place where the property purportedly
alienated is located, the lex situs should apply to this first issue.209 How should the issue of
settlor capacity be approached in self-settlement cases where the settlor unilaterally declares
himself trustee of his property? There has been no alienation of the settlor's property, only
the capacity in which the settlor holds it has changed. The capacity of the settlor to create
a trust of any property of which he may, according to the lex situs in which the property
is located, dispose is governed by the proper law of the trust.210 Curiously, Article 9 of the

hold property on trust for their principal.

M Verwilghen (eds), E Pluribus Unum: Liber Amicorum Gorges Droz (The Hague/London/Boston, Kluwer Law
1996) at 217: 'the image employed was that of the launcher and the rocket; it will always be necessary to have a
"launcher", for example a will a gift or other action with legal effects, which then "launches" the "rocket", the trust.
The preliminary act with legal effects, the "launcher", does not fall under the Convention's coverage'.

disposition is inter vivos, in the case of a testamentary transfer the lex successionis should be applied so as to avoid
scope for the application of any foreign claw-back rules in favour of forced heirs.
210 As to determining the proper law, see below.

Conflict of Law Issues

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides that in respect of a Jersey law trust the capacity of the
settlor is governed exclusively by Jersey law. It is questionable how effective such a rule
would be in respect of trusts of property located outside Jersey; and in particular in relation
to the settlement of immovables which is typically governed by the lex situs.
b. Capacity of the Trustee
2-92

The capacity of the intended trustee to receive trust property inter vivos is governed by the
lex situs at the time of the purported transfer.211 The capacity of the trustee to act as trustee of any property which he is permitted, according the lex situs in which the property is
located, to receive is governed by the proper law of the trust.212
c. Capacity of the Beneficiary

2-93

The capacity of a person to receive property at all inter vivos is determined by the lex situs
in which the property is located, at the time of the purported transfer of property to the
trustee. The capacity of a person who may according to the lex situs in which the property
is located, receive property to assert a beneficial interest under a trust is governed by the
proper law of the trust.
d. Vesting Property in the Trustee

2-94

2-95

The question of whether the property has been successfully vested in trustees is excluded
from the scope of the Convention and is thus subject to the general conflicts of laws rules
applicable to transfers of property. We are here concerned with only whether the lex situs
recognises whether the legal title to property may be alienated. Because of the civilian angle
to the Convention, any consideration of whether a transfer encompasses both a legal and
equitable transfer is a blind alley because civil jurisdictions may not recognise the concept of equitable ownership. The metaphorical process of 'launching the rocket' cannot be
invalidated because the lex situs does not recognise the concept of beneficial ownership. The
particular interest that the beneficiary acquires is governed by the proper aw of the trust.
For the purposes of the conflict of laws a distinction is made between movable and immovable property. Within the former category are tangible and intangible movable property. It
is the lex situs of the property that determines whether the property in question is movable
or immovable213 although where the situs of an asset is regarded as being, must be a matter
of Jersey law. The question of whether any proprietary interest has been transferred inter
vivos214 from a would-be settlor to a would-be trustee is determined by the lex situs of the
particular asset at the time of the transfer215 Whether a disposition by the trustee is effective

to transfer the equitable title or other protected beneficial rights to a would-be beneficiary
is determined by the proper law of the trust.
e. Forced Heirship
The key question is whether forced heirship rules affects the trust structure itself or affect
the ability of the deceased settlor to transfer title to the trustee at all. If it affects only the
ability to create the trust structure, it falls within the Convention and the mandatory rules
of the law applicable to succession may be applied under Article 15(1)(c). Only where the
forced heirship rule impugns the ability of the settlor to transfer title to the trustee full stop
should it be regarded as falling outside the Convention under Article 4. Where a transfer is
affected by forced heirship rules, the law governing the deceased estate should determine
whether and to what extent a testamentary disposition should be restricted by the forced
heirship rules.
Where the testator/settlor is Jersey domiciled, Jersey's succession law provides, only in cases
of testate succession of movable property,216 that a testator/settlor only has power to freely
dispose of one-third of their movable estate.217 Where the testator purports to dispose of
any portion of the remaining two-thirds, whether or not by settling the assets into trust,
such a disposition is liable to be challenged by the settlor's surviving spouse and/or issue
to reduce the gift in excess of the free one-third ad legitimum modem. These légitime rights
do not operate automatically upon the testator's powers of disposal but must be specifically
claimed within one year and one day from the date of the testator's death.218 While forced
heirship rights under the law of jurisdictions other than Jersey will not be given effect to
by the Royal Court where any dispute arises as to the validity of a Jersey trust or the validity of any disposition of property into a Jersey trust,219 Article 9(3) carves out a specific
exemption for Jersey's légitime regime which will apply to such questions where a trust is
established by a Jersey domiciled settlor.220

2-96

2-97

B. Determining Proper or Governing Law of a Trust
The proper law of the trust will also determine what parts of the 1984 legislation are applicable to the trust or any dispute under it. Part 2 of the Law applies only to Jersey law trusts
while Part 3 applies only to foreign law trusts. Part 4 contains general provisions applicable
to either foreign or jersey law trusts. The governing law of a trust can be a significant ­factor

216 There is no restrictions on a testator's power, either inter vivos or by will, to effect a disposition of Jersey
immovable property but by virtue of Art 11(2)(a)(iii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 it is impossible to constitute
a trust of Jersey immovable property.

heirship regimes around the world.

as to whether the Court will assume jurisdiction over a trust. The proper law of trust is
determined in accordance with Article 4 of the Trusts Law221 which provides:
4 Proper law of a trust
(1)

(2)

(3)

2-99

2-100

2-101

Subject to Article 41, the proper law of a trust shall be the law of the jurisdiction -
(a) expressed by the terms of the trust as the proper law; or failing that
(b) to be implied from the terms of the trust; or failing either
(c) with which the trust at the time it was created had the closest connection.
The references in paragraph (1) to 'failing that' or 'failing either' include references to cases -
(a) where no law is expressed or implied under sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of that paragraph;
and
(b) where a law is so expressed or implied, but that law does not provide for trusts or the
category of trusts concerned.
In ascertaining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(c), the law with which a trust had the closest
connection, reference shall be made in particular to -
(a) the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor;
(b) the situs of the assets of the trust;
(c) the place of residence or business of the trustee;
(d) the objects of the trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled.

There are therefore three routes by which the proper law may be determined. However, the
routes in Article 4(1) are not alternatives but must be applied in descending order. Only if
the proper law cannot be determined or the resulting proper law results in a proper law that
does not recognise trusts or the category of trust with which the dispute is concerned can
recourse be made to the next sub-paragraph.
In the vast majority of modern express trusts the trust instrument will contain a proper
law clause which will usually (subject to any argument as to whether it is in fact a choice
of law clause) be determinative of the issue under Article 4(1)(a). A settlor may choose the
governing law of the trust, irrespective of whether the chosen law has any objective connection with the settlor, the trust assets or the beneficiaries. To be valid the choice must be
of an individual legal system; in the absence of a valid choice of law the governing law will
be determined in accordance with Article 7 of the Convention.222 Further, the choice must
be that of a state which recognises trusts. Where a choice is made and the law does not provide for trusts or the category of trust involved the choice shall not be effective and the law
applicable in the absence of choice shall apply.223 Where the law with the closest connection
to the trust is that of jurisdiction which does not recognise trusts the Convention's rules
become inapplicable.224 Jersey, having enacted its own legislation that almost identically
mirrors Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, would continue to apply the closest connection
test, irrespective of whether that leads to a jurisdiction in which the trust would be invalid.
Where there is a subsequent addition to the assets of a trust whose settlor has validly chosen
a governing law, the subsequent accretion does not have the effect of altering the governing

221 Which corresponds with Arts 5-7 of the Convention.

law of the original trust, although where the second settlor specifies a particular proper law
in their transfer that may be taken as an intention by that settlor to establish a separate trust
of the transferred assets.

i. Implied Choice of Law
If there is no express choice of law, there may be an implied one. This involves ascertaining
the settlor's subjective intentions. An implied choice may be made from the terms of the
instrument creating or the writing evidencing the trust, interpreted, if necessary, in the light
of the circumstances of the case.225 When considering the trust instrument, the terms or reference to matters that are resonant of a particular legal system will normally determine the
issue without recourse to extrinsic evidence. The trust instrument or writing evidencing the
trust is the first point of reference; an implied intention cannot be inferred only from
the circumstances of the case in the absence of assistance from the trust instrument or other
written evidence thereof.226
As the question of the proper law is always at large when recourse is being made to Article 4,
it is the authors' view that Jersey law must be applied in respect of the connecting factors
in Article 4(3). That is to say, the situs of the assets of the trust or the place of residence or
business of the trustee is determined in accordance with the meaning of those concepts
under Jersey law.
The Convention (if it applies at all) is only relevant where the proper law of the trust is
not that of Jersey. If the Royal Court accepts jurisdiction but finds that under Article 4, the
proper law of the trust is not Jersey law, it will apply the foreign proper law, not including
its conflict of laws rules. The concept of renvoi is therefore excluded from the scope of the
Convention. As an example, if the Court held the proper law of a trust to be English law
then the Court would apply English trust law but not English conflict of laws rules pertaining to trusts as modified by the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987.

2-102

2-103

2-104

ii. Applicable Law in the Absence of Choice of Law
Where a choice of law is not expressed and cannot be implied, or the choice that has been
made is invalid, the governing proper law must be determined in accordance with Article
4(1)(c).227 Without prejudice to the taking into account of other factors, the Convention
and Jersey legislation list 'in particular' four factors which are to be regarded as having a
magnetic or especial importance in ascertaining the law most closely connected to the trust:
(1) the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor; (2) the situs of the
assets of the trust; (3) the place of residence or business of the trustee; and (4) the objects
of the trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled.
Where the place of administration of the trust is designated by the settlor, this will be a very
strong indicator as to the implied choice of law under Article 4(1)(b).228 As to the situs of

trust assets, this is likely to have the greatest significance where a significant portion of the
assets are immovables on the basis that enforcing an order relating to property in a state
in which the property is located means that the Royal Court would be unlikely to decide
a dispute differently from the way that the judge in the court of the situs would decide it.
The place of residence or business of the trustees is likely to be of no significance where
the trustees are spread over a number of jurisdictions.229 Where the trustee(s) is in a single
jurisdiction or the trustee is a company specifically appointed as trustee in a particular
jurisdiction this may be of greater significance.230 As to the final factor-the objects of the
trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled-the objects or purposes of the trust are
unlikely (objectively speaking) to tell the Court much about the law of closest connection
unless it is possible to infer from this something objective about where the trust's assets
should be invested or where it should be administered.231 The domicile of the settlor and
residence of the beneficiaries are not expressly mentioned but the list is not closed.232 It is
a matter of controversy whether the Court should have regard to whether the validity of
the trust impacts on the determination of the proper law, eg if the proper law is of jurisdiction X the trust is valid, if the proper law is of jurisdiction Y it is invalid. While it might be
argued that in having established a trust the implied intention of the settlor must be that
he would have chosen a governing law in which the validity of the trust would be upheld,
the better view must be that by having recourse to the closest connection test in the first
place, no implication is possible. Objectively speaking, the law of closest connection must
remain the law of closest connection irrespective of whether it leads to the validity or invalidity of the settlement.233

iii. Renvoi
2-107

Once the governing law of the trust has been determined, that law is applied without
regard to the governing law's own conflict of laws rules; the doctrine of renvoi is therefore
excluded.234 As an example, if the Royal Court held the proper law of a trust to be English
law then the Court would apply English trust law but not English conflict of laws rules pertaining to trusts as modified by the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987.

C. Scope of the Governing Law

governs the validity and effect of the trust and also its construction and administration236
although under the dépeçage provision in Article 9 of the Convention it is possible for a
settlor to choose another law to govern the construction of the trust from the law governing
its administration. This provision sits awkwardly with Article 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984, which provides that Jersey law alone is to apply to the administration of a Jersey trust,
whether the administration be conducted in Jersey or elsewhere, including questions as to
the powers, obligations, liabilities and rights of trustees and their appointment or removal
even if the settlor has expressly chosen another law to govern this issue. The only way
Article 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 can be reconciled with the Convention is if Article 9
is treated as an overriding rule of the forum pursuant to Article 16 of that Convention.
Article 8(2)(a) provides that the proper law will govern 'the appointment, resignation and
removal of trustees'. This differs from the old English common law rules that an English
court would make orders to appoint or remove trustees according to English law against
trustees of a foreign law trust if those trustees were within the jurisdiction of the English
court.237
Article 8(2)(b) applies the governing law of the trust to the rights and duties of trustees
among themselves. Where a trustee makes a claim against a co-trustee for contribution
in a breach of trust action, in England the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 applies
irrespective of the applicable law of the trust and to the exclusion of the applicable law.238
Under Jersey law the jurisdiction conferred upon the Royal Court by statute to order a contribution is considerably narrower than currently exists in England239 although in English
common law there existed an inherent jurisdiction for the court to award a contribution
as between co-trustees in a breach of trust action (which has now been subsumed within
the wider statutory jurisdiction under the 1978 Act). It is considered that such an inherent
jurisdiction also exists at Jersey customary law.
Article 8(2)(c) provides that the trustee's power to delegate his powers is to be determined
in accordance with the proper law. This provision does not deal with the consequences
of delegation which will be determined in accordance with whatever law governs that
relationship.240
Article 8(2)(d) deals with the administration of the trust and the trustee's power to deal
with and acquire trust property. These powers may also be subject to dépeçage but in the
absence of dépeçage the law governing the administration of the trust will be the proper law
of the trust. The question arises whether Jersey statutory provisions concerning a trustee's
powers can be applied to trusts governed by foreign law.241 Article 8(2)(d) also concerns the
trustee's power to create a security interest in the trust property. While the proper law will
determine whether a security interest can be created, the nature of that interest in the hands
of the secured party is a matter of the lex situs of the asset to which the security attaches.

Conflict of Law Issues

Article 8(2)(e) concerns the investment powers of the trustee which are one of the key
­elements of the proper administration of the trust. While jurisdictions like Jersey and
­England and Wales have expanded the powers of trustee when it comes to the types of asset
they can invest in,242 these are not to be regarded as mandatory rules that can be used to
cut across the rules of the proper law of the trust. Article 8(2)(f) deals with the duration of
the trust and powers of accumulation of income. A Jersey trust may last indefinitely.243 The
Royal Court must respect any period of perpetuity or accumulation period that is imposed
on a trust governed by foreign law.
Article 8(2)(g) provides that the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries
including the personal liability of the trustees to the beneficiaries shall be subject to the
proper law of the trust. The proper law will govern the fiduciary and other duties owed
by the trustee and a protector to the beneficiaries. Evidently, this article does not cover the
liability of trustees to third parties, so liability that arises from a trustee misappropriating a
third party's property and mixing it with the trust's assets is not to be determined in accordance with the proper law of the trust.
Article 8(2)(h) deals with the variation and termination of trusts.244 On its face,
Article 8(2)(h) would suggest that when the English High Court exercises its jurisdiction
to vary a Jersey law trust under section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, then the
variation should be in accordance with Jersey, rather than English law. The same approach
would appear to govern the jurisdiction of the High Court to make an order under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958.245 However, Charalambous v Charalambous246 held that section 24
was a mandatory rule of English law within the meaning of Article 15 of the Convention,
thereby overriding the application of the proper law of the trust. Whether there really was
any pressing reason to treat section 24 as a mandatory rule of English law is questionable.247
The correct threshold being that the proper law should be applied to any variation of a
non-English law trust save in cases where to do so would be manifestly incompatible with
English public policy under Article 18.
Article 9(4) provides that no foreign judgment in respect of a Jersey trust shall be enforceable to the extent that it is inconsistent with Jersey law. In respect of a trust the proper law
of which is Jersey, the provision is wholly consistent with Article 8(2)(h).
One solution might be that in the case of a Jersey trust, were the English court to exercise
the jurisdiction contained in Article 47 of the Trusts Law (the equivalent of the English Variation of Trusts Act 1958 jurisdiction) to vary the Jersey trust and the trustee has submitted
to the English court's jurisdiction then Article 9(4) would have no application because the
judgment against the trustees would have been determined in accordance with Jersey law.
Such a solution would also be wholly consistent with Article 8(2)(h).
The practical issue is that despite the Convention, it has long been the practice of the
English High Court, where it thinks fit, to order a variation to a foreign law trust in divorce

proceedings using English law and will use Articles 15, 16 and even 18 to buttress the
­jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
This solution gets the trustees off the horns of a dilemma in taking the risk of not submitting to English proceedings for the purposes of providing documents and defending the
interests of the trust and any subsequent English court order being recognised in Jersey so
as to provide protection to the trustees from any breach of trust claim.

D. Limits on the Scope of the Governing Law
The effect of recognition under Article 11 is qualified by the saving provisions for mandatory rules in Articles 15 and 16 and for public policy under Article 18.

2-119

i. Distinguishing Mandatory Rules and Public Policy Considerations
Mandatory rules are positive rules of law which a state insists upon applying and are superimposed onto the governing law even in circumstances where a different governing law is
applicable. A settlor is not permitted to derogate from mandatory rules. Public policy on
the other hand involves the disapplication of the foreign governing law in whole or in part
and is invoked in in circumstances where the court would consider it unacceptable to give
effect to it.

2-120

ii. Mandatory Rules of the Law Applicable to Related Areas of Law
The first paragraph of Article 15 preserves the mandatory rules of the law designated by the
conflicts rules of the forum for matters other than trusts. The second paragraph permits
the judge to mitigate the effect of the first paragraph. It may well be that the provisions of
a trust or provisions of the applicable law that govern it might be incompatible with the
law applicable to another matter under the forum's own conflict of laws rules. Article 15 is
intended to preserve the substantive rules of a foreign law that is designated by the private
international law rules of the forum.

2-121

Where a conflict arises between the applicable law of the trust and the applicable law conflict of laws rules in relation to the matters listed in Article 15, the former must be read
as giving effect to the latter. Article 15 is concerned with the mandatory rules of the state
whose law is designated by the forum's choice of law rules as being applicable in the related
areas. Article 15 provides a non-exhaustive list or areas of law related to the trust.248 As to
how Article 15 applies in practice: The Jersey Royal Court might have jurisdiction over a
trust whose applicable law is that of Utopia but Utopian law might designate the lex situs
to determine the capacity of a person to act as a trustee of particular trust property which
is located in Oz.

2-122

248 Art 15(2) provides that where a mandatory rule is applied under Art 15(1) the Court shall try to give effect
to the objects of the trust by other means, which might allow a non-trust state which cannot recognise the trust
qua trust because of the application of the mandatory rule, to give effect to it by 'translating' it into the nearest
domestic law analogue.

Conflict of Law Issues

Article 15(1)(c) may appear to have the effect of preserving the rights of forced heirship
under the law applicable to the settlor's succession in respect of the deceased's inter vivos
gifts of property into trust that are situated in a jurisdiction recognising forced heirship
claims concerning such property. However, its practical application is likely to be more limited, in accordance with the English position. Article 4 will usually operate so as to prevent
any testamentary trust from arising to the extent that it purports to cover that part of the
estate reserved for heirs.249 It is unlikely that Jersey would permit a validly created Jersey
law inter vivos trust to be undermined by foreign forced heirship rules. A transfer by a living settlor inter vivos to trustees is a preliminary issue outside the Convention. The relevant
question is whether at the time when the settlor purported to create an inter vivos trust, he
could and did alienate his property to the trustees in accordance with the lex situs. If the
transfer is valid according to the lex situs, and the trust is valid according to the applicable
law (Jersey) the transfer cannot later be impugned under Article 15(1)(c). It would also
likely be contrary to Jersey public policy, under Article 18, to require trustees to wait and see
whether the settlor died domiciled in a forced heirship jurisdiction, for potentially a long
period after setting up the trust and not to exercise any dispositive powers except above the
value of the property received from the settlor.
Article 15(1)(d) preserves the application of mandatory rules of the applicable law concerning the transfer of title to property and security interests in property. This article is
not concerned with the transfer of property to the trustees as this is a preliminary issue
excluded by Article 4.
Article 15(1)(e) covers the protection of creditors in matters of insolvency. This must
be taken to mean the protection of an insolvent beneficiary's creditors rather than the
creditors of an insolvent trust; otherwise there would be no effective ring-fenced fund.250
A protective trust might be vulnerable to being subject to the mandatory rules of the designated governing law as being as a means of frustrating the claims of creditors.251 The
article should also cover trusts declared by a settlor that can be set aside as a transaction at
undervalue or a preference, if not regarded as a preliminary issue.

iii. International Mandatory Rules of the Forum
2-126

2-127

Article 16 preserves the application of the forum's international mandatory rules as distinct
from the domestic mandatory rules of the jurisdiction designated by the application of
the forum's choice of law rules. The forum's international mandatory rules are those rules
which the settlor is not permitted to derogate from and which are intended to be applied
irrespective of the governing law of the trust.252
Article 16 permits a state leeway to apply its own international mandatory rules in any
areas that might affect particular trusts so as to override the terms of the trust. The laws
that might fall within Article 16 are those intended to protect the cultural heritage of the

Transfers by will are a preliminary issue outside the scope of the Convention.

a protective trust governed by Jersey law.

c­ ountry, public health, certain vital economic interests, the protection of employees or of the
weaker party to a contract.253 Article 16(2) permits the application (but only in ­'exceptional
circumstances') of the international mandatory rules of a state of close connection with the
trust, whose law is neither the law of the forum nor the applicable law. It is to be noted that
the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 omits Article 16(2) but given that legislation does not
apply to Jersey it must be assumed that Article 16(2) can be applied as there has been no
Jersey derogation under Article 16(3).254

iv. Public Policy
Article 18 provides that the provisions of the Convention (encompassing both the choice of
law rules and the recognition of trusts) may be disregarded where their application would
be manifestly contrary to public policy. 'Manifestly' indicates a high threshold and Article 18
should be interpreted restrictively so as not to undermine the purpose of the Convention.
It has been suggested that Article 18 is a threshold that is rarely, if ever, surmounted255 and
will generally be confined to rules which are oppressive, infringe upon human rights or are
impossible to give effect to.256

­regulations in connection with Art 16; Von Overbeck para 149.
254 D Hayton in J Glasson, International Trust Laws, 2nd edn (Bristol, Jordan Publishing Ltd, 2006) ch C3 at 16:
'Since a court of equity will do nothing in vain and will not require a person to do an act that is illegal where it is
to be done, so that sufficient define protection exists, there seems no need for a common law country [of which
Jersey may be one] to adopt this paragraph [Article 16(2)] of worryingly indefinite ambit'.
255 M Koppenol-Laforce, Het Haagse Trustverdrag (Deventer, Kluwer, 2002) at 270, 'From experiences with
similar articles it follows that such articles [referring to 16 and 18] are hardly ever applied. I see no reason why
this should be different with trust cases. Article 16 is the real danger to the recognition of the trust'. However the
problems created by the recognition of the trust in non-trust states provides a real prospect that Art 18 will be used
more widely as a route of last resort to thwart the recognition of a trust.
256 See Dicey, Morris & Collins, The Conflict of Laws, 15th edn (London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2016) ch 5, on the
use of public policy in the conflict of laws. Typical cases where public policy is invoked include where the applicable law is fundamentally contrary to basic principles of human liberty, standards of justice, morality or where good
relations with a friendly state may be adversely affected.

the Variation of Trusts
I. Introduction
A trustee may find itself as a party to litigation in a variety of circumstances. Other chapters
of this text concern the law and court procedures available to a beneficiary, or trustee on
their behalf, where the trustee is in breach of their obligations and proceedings are issued to
remedy that position. This chapter is concerned primarily with a very different context in
which litigation before the Royal Court involving trusts arises, namely:
1.
2.

3-1

a dispute as to the terms upon which the trustees hold and/or administer the subject
matter of the trust ('a trust dispute'); and
a dispute with one or more of the beneficiaries as to the propriety of any action in
the trustee's administration of the trust which the trustees may or may not take in the
future ('a beneficiary dispute').1

These categorisations of trust dispute (which in some cases may not in fact be meaningfully
described as a dispute at all)2 may be contrasted with a third and fourth category of trust
dispute: where the beneficiaries attack the propriety of something done or not done by the
trustee (a species of beneficiary dispute but where the acts that give rise to the litigation
have already happened) and where a third party to the trust issues proceedings against the
trustee in the course of administration of the trust (a third party dispute). The purpose of
these categorisations is not to see how many angels one can make dance on the head of a
pin. The categorisation of a given dispute has important consequences for the way the costs
of the proceedings fall to be paid.
If the proceedings make allegation of breach of trust on the part of the trustee, an Order of
Justice is the more appropriate form of originating process for the action. Disputes between
the trust and third parties are also usually normally commenced by Order of Justice as they
are, as between the trustee and the third party, no different from any other piece of civil
litigation before the Royal Court. However, proceeding by way of Representation may be

appropriate in the context of a third party dispute where the third party is claiming beneficial ownership of the assets subject to the trust which necessarily involves the Court's
intervention into the internal administration of the trust by determining on whose behalf
the trustee holds the trust assets.
Hearings for actions commenced under Articles 51 and 47 transfer (Jersey) law 1984 are
generally heard by the Court sitting in private. While this is intended to provide a safe space
for the airing of all relevant matters before the Court, it does give rise to some important
practical and legal consequences that practitioners contemplating a private hearing must
bear in mind.
In this chapter, we consider applications to the Royal Court, typically by trustees but also in
some cases by beneficiaries, for a determination on questions arising in the administration
of the trust including proceedings for directions as to the exercise of powers. This chapter
also considers the jurisdiction conferred upon the Royal Court by Article 47 of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 to vary the terms of a trust. Article 47 contains two distinct jurisdictions: the jurisdiction for the Royal Court to approve an arrangement varying the beneficial
interests under trust on behalf of those deemed unable to do so themselves and jurisdiction
to vary the scope of the trustee's powers of management and administration of the trust
property. Applications under this provision are a classic example of a 'trust dispute'. This
chapter is also concerned with how the costs of trust disputes and beneficiary disputes fall
to be paid. This chapter also deals with the principles and civil procedure in applying for
Beddoe relief (a specialised form of application for directions, concerned with the question
whether trustees should litigate at the expense of the trust property and the incidence of
costs in that litigation). Outside the scope of this chapter, but considered elsewhere, are the
following kinds of trust dispute:
applications for the removal of trustees and power holders;3
proceedings for the rescission or rectification of trust instruments on grounds of
mistake;4
proceedings concerning unauthorised profits and self-dealing transactions made by or
entered into by trustees;5
proceedings concerning disclosure by trustees or others of information about the
trust;6 and
issues as to the trustee's indemnity for the costs of legal proceedings in the second
category of beneficiary dispute alluded to above and in respect of third party claims
against the trust and trustee.7

The Supervisory Jurisdiction

II. The Supervisory Jurisdiction of the Royal Court
and Applications for Directions
The Royal Court, as in the Chancery Division of the English High Court, has an inherent
supervisory jurisdiction in relation to trusts that permits it to intervene in their administration where it considers it appropriate.8 This inherent jurisdiction is given expression, in
part, by Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. Trustees are entitled to seek the assistance
of the Court in determining the manner in which the trustee may or should act in connection with any matter concerning the trust.9 Matters that may come before the Court for
determination under Article 51 are many and various, ranging from the construction of a
provision in the trust instrument, whether the trustee should defend or prosecute a claim
made against them in the course of their administration of the trust, whether the trustee
should exercise its powers in a way that is potentially of momentous importance to the
beneficiaries, to whether the trustee or beneficiary is permitted to use trust documents in
foreign proceedings, to name but a few. Upon the Court's direction, a trustee may act in
accordance with that without fear that in so doing they may be acting in a way for which
they might later be criticised by the beneficiaries or made liable to them. The matters upon
which the Court can give directions are extremely broad and for reference the full terms of
Article 51 are set out here:
51 Applications to and certain powers of the court
(1) A trustee may apply to the court for direction concerning the manner in which the trustee may
or should act in connection with any matter concerning the trust and the court may make such
order, if any, as it thinks fit.
(2) The court may, if it thinks fit -
(a)

make an order concerning -
(i)
the execution or the administration of any trust,
(ii) the trustee of any trust, including an order relating to the exercise of any power, discretion or duty of the trustee, the appointment or removal of a trustee, the remuneration of a trustee, the submission of accounts, the conduct of the trustee and payments,
whether payments into court or otherwise,
(iii) a beneficiary or any person having a connection with the trust, or
(iv) the appointment or removal of an enforcer in relation to any non-charitable purposes
of the trust;

(b) make a declaration as to the validity or the enforceability of a trust;
(c) rescind or vary any order or declaration made under this Law, or make any new or further
order or declaration.
(3) An application to the court for an order or declaration under paragraph (2) may be made by
the Attorney General or by the trustee, the enforcer or a beneficiary or, with leave of the court, by
any other person.

(4) Where the court makes an order for the appointment of a trustee it may impose such conditions

Article 51 is a mandatory provision of Jersey's trust law and cannot be derogated from or
excluded by the terms of the trust instrument. Article 51 is located in Part 4 of the 1984
Law, making the Court's jurisdiction available to both Jersey law and foreign law governed
trusts.10 Only the Royal Court sitting in the Inferior Number has jurisdiction to grant relief
under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.11
In many applications to court under Article 51 that involve some adjudication on some
course of action proposed to be taken by trustees, the underlying question may be one as
to the construction of the trust instrument or some other provision.12 The Court will grant
relief by making a declaration as to the construction to be given. There is no mechanism
in Jersey equivalent to the English courts' jurisdiction under section 48 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to obtain an order based on counsel's opinion as to the particular
construction of a trust provision without the need for a hearing. In other cases the question
may not be the scope or construction of the trustee's powers but one as to the good sense of
a proposed course of action, such as a Beddoe application. In that instance the Court is not
being asked to make a declaration as the meaning of a document or even to give directions
on the basis of a particular set of factual assumptions; but to exercise a judgment.
The classification of an application to court for directions under Article 51 of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 and the consequences following from that classification, and the precise
role of the Court turns on the precise question being asked and whether or not the trustee
has surrendered its discretion to the Court. Trustees may, in a suitable case, surrender their
discretion to the Court, which will then act in the trustee's stead and direct the exercise
of the power itself. Alternatively, the trustees may, without surrendering their discretion,
merely apply for the Court's approval of a proposed course of action, so as to protect them
against future criticism from the beneficiaries. Where there is no surrender of discretion,
the Court's function is circumscribed and it grants approval if satisfied that there is no
impropriety in the course proposed by the trustee.
Although it is commonplace to refer to every application under Article 51 as an application for directions the term is perhaps more properly confined to an application as to some
course of action proposed to be taken in exercise of the trustee's powers, and perhaps then
only if there is a surrender of the trustee's discretion. Where there is no surrender of discretion, the course the trustee wishes to take has already been set, subject to the Court's
blessing and no 'direction' as to what the trustee should do, in the true sense is sought. The
distinction between exercising a substantive judgment on and giving declaratory relief can

be of some significance, since a declaration as to, say, the width of a class of beneficiaries
will be determinative of one or more persons' rights, whereas directions given on a Beddoe
application will not. The nature of the jurisdiction the Court is exercising is also relevant to
the test for an appeal of any such decision.13 The application of Jersey's human rights legislation (and its impact on the practice of conducting directions hearings in private) turns
on the distinction14 and so does the necessity of ensuring that all beneficiaries who may be
affected are either made parties or are represented.15

A. Article 51(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984-Directions Concerning
the Manner in which the Trustee May or Should Act in Connection
with any Matter Concerning the Trust
Only a trustee16 has locus to make an application under Article 51(1) whereas the locus to
seek an order under Article 51(2) is considerably wider, although applications by trustees
are far more common than applications by beneficiaries. It may also be that the jurisdiction
extends to a person who is alleged to be a trustee, or who is concerned that he may incur
liability as a constructive trustee; either qua trustee or as 'any other person', with leave,
under Article 51(3). Because Article 51 merely gives expression to the Court's inherent
jurisdiction to give directions in the administration of a trust and is not the source of it, the
Court may, in theory, also make an order under Article 51(2) of its own motion but in reality will not to do so without hearing argument. Beddoe applications can be framed within
Article 51(1) although the jurisdiction itself also arises from the Court's inherent jurisdiction.

3-11

B. Article 51(2)(a)(i)-(ii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984-Orders
Concerning the Administration of any Trust and Orders Concerning
the Trustee
The scope of the jurisdiction of the court under Article 51(2) is potentially very wide but it
does not confer a freewheeling unfettered power on the Inferior Number to do as it pleases.
The Court's supervisory jurisdiction must be exercised on a principled basis.17 The Court
is mindful that the settlor has not chosen the Court to act as trustee. The appointed trustee
is likely to be a professional, regulated entity, charging for its services. The Court will be
reluctant to assume the trustee's role; that is not its function.18 The Court's role is supervisory and it is limited to ensuring that decisions taken by trustees are reasonable and lawful.19 In proceedings brought under Article 51(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law, the Court

does not simply substitute its own discretion for that of the trustee unless the trustee has
surrendered its discretion to the Court and the Court agrees to accept such surrender.20 The
Court cannot overturn a decision of a trustee which has not surrendered its discretion to
the Court, merely because the Court would have reached a different decision.21 The Court
may only intervene where the decision is one which no reasonable trustee could arrive at.22
This is consistent with the fundamental concept of trust law which is that the discretion of
a trustee is conferred upon that trustee and the beneficiaries have to live with the decision of
that trustee unless it is vitiated by one or more of the sort of circumstances set out below.23
There are clearly circumstances where an order will overlap Article 51(2)(a)(i) and Article
51(2)(a)(ii). An order directing the distribution of the trust fund to certain beneficiaries
will be an order concerning the execution or administration of the trust as well as relating
to the exercise of any power, discretion or duty of the trustee. A settlor, or someone claiming through a settlor such as a creditor, who claims entitlement to the trust assets by way of
a resulting trust to the settlor is, we consider, a person within Article 51(2)(a)(i) since the
wording is simply 'any trust'.24 Clearly, Article 51(2)(a)(ii) is the jurisdiction under which
the Court, on the beneficiary's application, can seek to exert some measure of control over
the incumbent trustee. If it is alleged that the trustee has not provided proper accounts, the
Court may stay the action for a specified period, ordering the trustee to file and serve proper
accounts within that period. A payment into court can practically only be ordered if the
trustee has money in his hands.25

C. Article 51(2)(a)(iii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984-Orders
Concerning a Beneficiary or any Person Having a Connection
with the Trust
3-14

The parameters of Article 51(2)(a)(iii) are, at first sight, extremely broad. The Court may
make any type of order so long as it concerns a beneficiary (qua beneficiary) or person connected with the trust. Regard must be had to the purpose for which the jurisdiction to grant
relief exists. The article is intended to give a general power to the Court to give directions in
administrative proceedings.26 The foundation of the jurisdiction lies in the nexus between
trustee and beneficiary arising out of the trust relationship. The fact that a person just happens to be a beneficiary is not of itself sufficient to justify the making of an order, the order
must be made for the purpose of vindicating, or at least promoting, some right or interest arising directly out of the trust relationship. Whether a person has a 'connection' with

The Supervisory Jurisdiction

127

the trust within the meaning of Article 51(2)(a)(iii) depends on the factual circumstances
relevant to the particular case. The connection must be a direct connection with the relationship between trustee and beneficiary constituted by the trust instrument.27 The Court
does not have any supervisory jurisdiction over the directors of a holding company whose
shares were held by a trustee, or any of the holding company's subsidiaries. The directors
of a company owe duties only to the company of which they are a director to act for the
benefit of members of the company as a whole.28 A settlor or protector or the potential
object of a discretionary power who is not a beneficiary at the relevant time, all have the
necessary direct and immediate connection with the trust relationship.29 A creditor of the
settlor convened at the outset of litigation to challenge the validity of dispositions into trust
will also have sufficient connection, since the issue is fundamental to the existence or otherwise of the trust relationship.30 A settlor with reserved fiduciary powers under a trust is
a 'person having connection' with trust, to the effect that the beneficiaries had the right to
seek from the settlor disclosure of information and access to documents held by the settlor
in connection with the exercise of its fiduciary powers under the trust.31 It has been held in
Jersey that Article 51(2)(a)(iii) cannot be used to order a director of a company owned by
the trust to disclose information about the company to the trustee on the grounds that the
directors owed no duty of disclosure to the trustee or beneficiaries of the trust that arose
directly out of the trust relationship. While as directors of the company, they had the ability
to procure the documents, their duties as directors were owed to the company and not to
the trustee or beneficiaries.32 The mere fact that there happened to be an identity between
persons who were the trustees of one trust and the trustees of a second trust could not
result per se in there being a connection between the first trust and the trustees of the second trust or vice versa.33 The order sought must affect the beneficiary in that capacity and
must be made for the purpose of vindicating or at least promoting some right or interest
arising directly out of the trust relationship.34 That test has been reviewed and refined by
the Guernsey Court of Appeal in In the Matter of R and RA Trusts35 as being too narrowly
cast. In R and RA Trusts, the trustee had sought an order for disclosure against some of the
trusts' beneficiaries for information concerning assets of the trust which was necessary to
enable the trustee to make an informed decision as to the division of the trust fund between
branches of a family. The trustee submitted that the equivalent Guernsey provision to
Article 51(2)(a)(iii)36 was in wide terms to the effect that the Court had jurisdiction to order
the disclosure because the holders of the information were beneficiaries. The beneficiaries,
in opposition to the trustee's application, sought to rely on the rationale for the decision in

Re B, C and D Settlements and an additional ground, namely that the Court had no jurisdiction to order disclosure against a beneficiary in the context of the trusts' administration.
In the Court's view, in order to justify an order against a beneficiary there must be sufficiently close connection between the position of the beneficiary, qua beneficiary, of the
trust whose affairs are being supervised and the relief being sought so as to justify the
exercise of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. The test for proximity is a flexible one; the
Court should look to the reality of the situation and not be overcome by technicalities.37
The power in Article 51(2)(a)(iii) is a statutory articulation of the Court's inherent jurisdiction to supervise and intervene in the administration of a trust. At its heart lies the protection of the interests of the beneficiaries as a whole.38 Being a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Guernsey the decision in R and RA Trusts is not binding on the Royal Court although the
presence of Sir Michael Birt, Bailiff of Jersey, on the panel is likely to make it, at least, highly
persuasive. A representor who is denied an order for disclosure at first instance in Jersey
may now be inclined to take the matter to the Court of Appeal. Although the received wisdom is that if the appellant is a trustee, in appealing he does so at his own risk as to adverse
costs, there are strong policy statements from the likes of Salmon LJ in Re Londonderry
Settlement,39 echoed in the RBC Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd v E40 decision itself that where
an appeal against an order for disclosure can be justified in relation to the welfare of the
beneficiaries as a whole, the trustee should take responsibility in either appealing the case
itself or by actively supporting a beneficiary who appeals. A trustee who appeals on the basis
that the information sought is necessary to protect the beneficiaries' interests is unlikely to
be held to have acted unreasonably so as to deprive itself of its indemnity from the fund for
any adverse costs.

B. General Administration Issues
The Royal Court may, theoretically make an administration order if it considers that the
issues between the parties cannot properly be resolved in any other way; however, there are
no reported decisions in which the Royal Court has assumed such a role (or directed the
Viscount to execute the trust)43 and it is likely to be extremely reluctant to do so given the
large number of professional trustees who may be appointed instead and the unwieldiness
of administration through the Court. A bare trustee or nominee is entitled to apply to
the Court for directions.44 The jurisdiction of the Royal Court to remove and/or replace a
trustee, protector or other power holder is a question arising in the course of the administration of the trust under Article 51.45 The wording of Article 51 is sufficiently wide to
encompass an action requiring a determination as to an issue of fact rather than a question
of construction such as the legitimacy of the birth of a person claiming to be a beneficiary
of a settlement under which only legitimate children are entitled.46 A settlor, or someone
claiming through a settlor such as a creditor, who claims entitlement to the trust assets by
way of a resulting trust to the settlor is, we consider, a person within Article 51(2)(a)(i)

IV. Applications for Directions Concerning the
Exercise of Powers
3-19

In re S Settlement,57 the Court identified four distinct but non-exhaustive, categories of
situation in which the trustee might seek to invoke the Court's jurisdiction on the exercise
of the trustee's powers:58
1.

'Category 1': The issue before the Court might be whether the proposed action is
within the trustees' powers.
'Category 2': The trustees may have already decided on a course of action which is
within their powers, but may wish to obtain the Court's blessing in view of the momentous nature of the decision. In such a case, the trustees do not surrender their discretion
to the Court.
'Category 3': The trustees do surrender their discretion to the Court. The Court will
only accept a surrender for good reason, such as where the trustees are honestly deadlocked or where they are unable to act because of a conflict of interest.
'Category 4': The fourth category concerns those situations where the trustees have
already taken action and that action is challenged as being beyond their powers or an
improper exercise of such powers.59

These categories provide a convenient working template or prism through which to analyse
both whether the proceedings are appropriate for the nature of the question being asked
of the Court by the trustee and also the approach the Court will take once proceedings are
commenced. However, it should be remembered that there may be degrees of variation
within each category and a particular application for directions may straddle one or more
categories. There may not always be a bright dividing line between category 2 cases (no surrender of discretion) and category 3 cases (surrender of discretion). The board of a trustee

may be unanimous that the circumstances exist that would (for example) justify a sale of a
special asset but be divided as to whether or not to sell.

A. 'Category 1': The Trustees Seek a Determination on their Powers
The extent of the trustees' powers is commonly but not invariably a matter of
construction, either of the trust instrument or of a statute. The Court will rule on such
questions on application by the trustees or a beneficiary so as to bind all interested parties.
If the issue is that the trustees' powers are inadequate, it is open to them to apply to the
Court for the conferral of a suitable power, either confined to a particular transaction or
generally under Article 47.

3-21

B. 'Category 2': The Trustees Seek the Court's Blessing of a Momentous
Decision
Whether a decision is 'momentous' is clearly context specific: the decision may be momentous for the future of the trust as a whole or momentous for the trustee in that the decision
may mean the trustee is put at risk of personal liability.60 Proof of the existence or likelihood of contention among the beneficiaries in relation to the particular decision will be
material to whether the decision is sufficiently momentous to require an application to
court. An application to bless a decision that is neither momentous nor otherwise difficult
will usually be dismissed and where an application is considered to have been inappropriate
and a waste of costs the trustees can be made to pay costs personally, and not from the fund
pursuant to their indemnity.61 A final distribution of the trust fund, in circumstances where
the trustee has a discretion as to the apportionment of the fund between the beneficiaries
and there is disagreement between the objects as to how that power should be exercised,
is likely to be a category 2 'momentous decision'.62 The trustees may sometimes seek the
Court's blessing concerning a particular transaction in relation to the trust assets.63 Generally, it is usually inappropriate, on the basis of the policy of non-intervention set out in S v L
& Bedell Cristin Trustees Limited,64 (and at the very least impractical) for the trustees to seek
the Court's blessing for everyday changes in the trust's assets. Very often the trustees' investment powers are delegated to professional asset managers who manage the fund's portfolio
day to day without the involvement of the trustees. An exception to this general approach
applies to decisions to sell so-called 'special assets' of the trust, such as a decision to sell a
family estate,65 or to dispose of a controlling interest in a family company.66

i. The Nature of the Application and the Surrender of Discretion
3-23

3-24

A trustee seeking directions on a momentous decision has a choice: (1) they may seek the
Court's approval of an exercise of a power which (subject to that approval) they have already
decided upon (category 2); or (2) they may seek to surrender the decision to the Court, so
that it is the Court which actually discharges the trustees' functions in that instance (category 3). Whether the trustees have surrendered their discretion to the Court and to what
degree will determine the parameters in which the Court can act and is of fundamental
importance to the nature of an application under Article 51.67 An application to court for
approval under Article 51 does not automatically entail a surrender of discretion.
In practice, it is not always apparent whether the trustee has in fact surrendered its discretion. A clear example of fence-sitting by the trustee is in the context of a Beddoe application
seeking the Court's leave to litigate, or not to litigate. The trustee may not indicate whether
they have decided upon a particular course for which they are seeking approval or leaving the decision to the Court. An application for approval of a course of action without a
surrender of the trustees' discretion will typically be made in a category 2 case, where the
decision that has been reached is particularly momentous for the trust. Where the Court is
asked to bless a course of action that the trustees have already decided upon the Court must
be addressed on at least the following three matters when it is asked to give directions:68
1.

whether the Court is satisfied that the trustee has formed the opinion in good faith
that the circumstances of the case render it desirable and proper for it to carry out the
proposed steps;
whether the Court is satisfied that the opinion which the trustees have formed is one
which is reasonable for the trustee, if properly instructed as to the exercise of their discretion, could have arrived at; and
whether the Court is satisfied that the opinion at which the trustee has arrived is not
vitiated by any actual or potential conflict of interest which has or might have affected
its decision.

3-26

The above matters are not exhaustive. It was made clear in Public Trustee v Cooper69 that the
duties of the Court in category 2 cases in particular depend upon the circumstances of each
case. There may be other matters beyond those three identified above.70
The Court's function where there is no surrender of discretion is more limited than if there
is a surrender. The Court is concerned to see that the proposed exercise of the trustees' powers is lawful, within the scope of the power and that it does not infringe the trustees' duty to
act as ordinary, reasonable and prudent trustees might act, ignoring irrelevant, improper or
irrational factors.71 The Court only needs to be satisfied that the trustees can properly form

the view that the proposed transaction is for the benefit of beneficiaries and that they have
in fact formed that view.72 Once it appears that the proposed exercise is within the terms
of the power proposed to be exercised, the Court is concerned only with limits of rationality and honesty and will not withhold its approval simply because it would not itself have
exercised the power in the way the trustee proposes.73 The Court will, however, act with
caution. It is to be remembered that in giving its blessing to the proposed course of action,
the beneficiaries will be barred thereafter from complaining that the exercise of the power
amounts to a breach of trust or can be set aside under Article 47I. Where the Court is left
in doubt as to the propriety of the trustees' proposal it will withhold its approval. This does
not amount to prohibition on the exercise proposed, only that the trustees undertake it at
their own risk. As with a surrender of discretion, the trustees are obliged to put all relevant
material and considerations before the Court. In our view, this will include disclosure of the
trustees' reasons since the reasons will necessarily be material to the Court's assessment of
whether the proposed exercise is made appropriately, even though in other circumstances
they would not otherwise be obliged to give such disclosure.74
The Court may also entertain an application under category 2 where the trustees have a
conflict of interest,75 without requiring them to surrender their discretion, if the power
might rationally be exercised in a number of different ways.76 That course may save the
expense of evidence and argument on the way in which the Court should exercise its discretion qua trustee.

3-27

C. 'Category 3': The Trustees do Surrender their Discretion to the Court
Where the trustee surrenders its discretion, the Court will act qua trustee in giving its directions. The Court acts as a reasonable trustee could be expected to act having regard to all
the material circumstances.77 The Court has no greater powers than the trustees would have
done, had they not surrendered their discretion. Trustees who surrender their discretion
must put before the Court all the material necessary to enable the discretion to be exercised,
including, for example, any requisite expert advice.78 This may include legal advice but it
has been held that disclosure of otherwise privileged material into Article 51 proceedings
will not amount to a waiver of privilege.79

Applications for Directions

The Court is not obliged to accept a surrender of the trustees' discretion. A surrender of discretion is generally regarded to be a course of last resort and will normally only be accepted
by the Court in relation to specific exercise of discretion where there is no sensible alternative.80 The trustees should be clear as to what aspect of their discretion they are surrendering to the Court. Where the Court does accept a surrender it will do so only for a limited,
discrete purpose and will be extremely reluctant to accept a general surrender of discretion
requiring it to act as trustee generally, or accept a surrender of a discretion that is to be
exercised from time to time in changing circumstances.81 The trustees have accepted office
under the terms of the particular trust instrument and are not entitled as a matter of course
to hand over the trusteeship to the court.82 There must be a good reason for the surrender.83 Good reasons have been held to include cases in which there is deadlock between the
trustees (or directors of a corporate trustee), of a kind which cannot be resolved by removing one trustee (or director) rather than another;84 cases in which the trustees are disabled
from acting by a conflict of interest;85 and cases in which the trustees are faced with a proposed compromise of litigation against a third party where the beneficiaries take strong and
opposed views as to the merits of accepting it86 and perhaps even where they do not.87 Even
without any contention by the beneficiaries as to the terms of a compromise, the trustees
may seek the court's approval for their decision to accept or reject it.88 Not every conflict of
interest will require the trustees to surrender their discretion. Where a transaction engages
the fair-dealing rule (ie a purchase by the trustee of a beneficial interest in the trust), the
trustee may seek the Court's approval without surrendering their discretion but will bear
the burden of establishing that the transaction was fair and reasonable.89 The trustee must
disclose the fact of the conflict of interest, even if it appears obvious.90 However, where a
transaction with the trust property engages the self-dealing rule so as to vitiate the transaction on the grounds of conflict of interest, the trustee must apply to court and surrender its
discretion if the transaction is challenged by the beneficiaries.

D. 'Category 4': Challenging the Purported Exercise of a Power after the
Event
It is open to beneficiaries to challenge an exercise (or purported exercise) of the trustees'
powers after the event. If a course taken by the trustees is within the four corners of the
power, the onus is on the challenger to show that their discretion has been improperly exercised. Where the action taken amounts to a breach of trust an action should be brought by
way of Order of Justice and recourse to Article 51 is usually inappropriate unless the transaction sought to be impugned can be set aside without any determination as to fault under
the Court's statutory jurisdiction.91 Cases within category 4 are usually hostile litigation to
be decided, without a privacy order, in open court. The grounds on which a challenge can
be mounted are broadly:

3-30

1. The trustees have failed to take into account only relevant matters or the exercise is
vitiated by mistake or misapprehension, sufficient to warrant setting the decision aside
under Article 47D-J of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.
2. A necessary consent to exercise a power has not been forthcoming.
3. The trustees' decision is predicated on a factual situation that is not accurate.
4. The trustees have not brought their minds to bear on their discretion but have acted
at the behest of others or have otherwise failed to give genuine consideration to the
exercise of the power.
5. There has been an excessive execution of the power.
6. The trustees have failed to remain impartial as between the beneficiaries.
7. The trustees have failed to comply with some formality imposed by the trust instrument or general law.
8. The trustees have failed adequately to indicate an intention to exercise a particular
power.
9. The power has purportedly been exercised by the wrong person. For example, where a
trustee has purported to appoint a new trustee but the power of appointment is in fact
vested in a protector.
10. The trustees have acted in breach of a duty of care in the exercise of investment or other
administrative powers.
11. The power has been exercised outside the time in which it was exercisable.
12. There has been a fraud on the power, ie the power has been exercised for a purpose for
which it was not conferred.
13. The trustee has a personal (and therefore a conflict of) interest in the exercise of the
power.
A beneficiary may commence proceedings challenging the acts of the trustee on any one
or more of the foregoing grounds and trustees can apply to the Court for a decision on
the validity of an exercise of one of their powers, once a doubt has arisen irrespective of
whether it was exercised by themselves or by their predecessors. Where a doubt has arisen,
the trustees need to know whether they should continue to administer the trust on the
footing that the exercise of the power was valid. A trustee who is at fault in failing to make

a timely and well-ordered application for the determination of whether a power was validly
exercised may be made to pay costs.92

V. Distributions and the Trustee's Right of Indemnity for
Liabilities and the Insolvency of a Jersey Trust
3-32

Liabilities incurred by the trustee with a third party, such as liabilities under a contract,
stand in a different category from the cases discussed thus far. In Jersey law,93 a trustee is
only liable to a third party with whom he expressly contracts qua trustee, up to the value of
the trust property in the trustee's hands.94 If the counterparty to the transaction does not
know that the trustee is acting as trustee, the trustee shall have recourse, first, to the trust
property by way of indemnity but will be personally liable to the full extent of his assets for
any shortfall.95 Article 32(1) would appear to provide a fool-proof means for the trustee
to avoid personal liability to a third party by making a distribution that reduces the trust
fund to below the value of the liability. However, the application of Article 32(1) is not a
straightforward matter. Where there is doubt as to the applicability of Article 32(1) or where
Article 32(2) is engaged, the trustee should seek directions under Article 51 before making a
distribution from the trust that would leave the fund unable to fully discharge the trustee's
liability to a third party. Where the liability is for a known sum, the trustee should satisfy it
from the trust fund before making any distribution. If the liability is for an unknown sum
the liability will have to be compromised or litigated. Where liabilities are prospective or
contingent an order of the Court cannot discharge a trustee from an obligation which he
himself has assumed. It therefore follows that before an order for distribution can be made,
the Court must permit the trustee (unless he is willing to rely on an indemnity from one
or more beneficiaries) to retain a sufficient portion of the trust property to meet any prospective or contingent liability which he has incurred in the performance of the trust. If the
amount of the retention cannot be agreed, the Court can fix it.

A. Distributions from the Trust Fund
3-33

Trustees often seek directions from the Court in order to distribute the fund on a particular
factual footing. A trustee cannot be expected to incur any risk of personal liability in the
distribution of the trust fund. Whether a proposed action is within the scope of the trustee's powers is ultimately a question of construction of the trust instrument.96 Where the
trustee's powers of distribution or the beneficiaries' entitlement to the trust fund are not
clear the trustee should either apply to the Court for directions under Article 51(2)(a)(ii)

137

or, in the few remaining cases in which it is proper to do so, pay the fund into court. The
trustee runs a personal risk if it distributes the trust fund in circumstances where there
are competing claims to the beneficial title (ie a tracing claim, or a disposition into trust
is being attacked as prejudicial to creditors or forced heirs or can otherwise be impugned
as the proceeds of crime etc). Where the trustee is aware of an adverse claim to the trust
property that is being pressed or is being held in abeyance, a distribution will usually have
to wait until the claim is determined. If the claim is not being pressed, or if the trustees are
aware of circumstances which may give rise to a claim that has not yet been brought but
may be, the case is more complicated. If the trustee is informed of an adverse claim against
the trust fund but no proceedings are brought for several years, the trustee may apply for
a direction as to whether and on what basis it may administer the trust disregarding the
claim. A trustee runs the risk of incurring personal liability if it distributes with notice of a
claim to the trust assets. Any application to court will have to either seek leave to distribute,
notwithstanding the claim or seek directions as to whether they should litigate the claim.97
The Court has power to permit a distribution notwithstanding the claim but will not ordinarily do so without giving notice of the application to the plaintiff.98 But the trustee could
not in our view be protected by court order against receipt-based personal claims unless the
third party was made a party or given notice of the proceedings. Even so, it appears that the
Court may order distribution if the possibility of a claim appears to be remote or speculative, not founded on firm evidence.99

B. Declaratory Relief
The Court had jurisdiction to make a declaratory judgment under Article 51(2)(b) on any
live issue before it with a sufficient degree of reality and immediacy to have a practical
bearing upon the resolution of an actual dispute or a dispute likely to arise in the future.
Preferring the law of Scotland to that of England,100 the Jersey courts have never adopted
the approach, prevailing in England, that a declaratory judgment could only be given on
rights which were certain to come into effect and not on those which were merely possible
or hypothetical:101
It has been observed that it is the function of the courts to decide only live, practical questions and
that they have no concern with hypothetical, premature or academic questions, nor do they exist to
advise litigants as to the policy which they should adopt in the ordering of their affairs. 'The Courts
are neither a debating club nor an advisory bureau.' Hypothetical questions will not be entertained.
The action 'cannot be used for the mere purpose of declaring legal propositions where no practical

question or dispute lies beneath.' It is a matter of the circumstances of each particular case whether
there is or is not a live practical question. There must be a sufficient degree of reality and immediacy before a declarator will be granted. If the declarator will have a practical bearing upon the
resolution of an actual dispute it will be competent. It is sufficient for the competency of a declarator that there be an actual consequence either pecuniary or in facto praestando. This need not be
an immediate practicality: a real possibility of the critical eventuality emerging may be sufficient.102

3-35

The Court will decide any question raised as to the rights of the beneficiaries in a way which
binds all the parties interested in the trust. If a question of construction of the settlement
is raised, the Court will pronounce upon the correct construction and all concerned will
be bound. Similarly, if a question of fact is raised, such as the paternity of one claiming as a
beneficiary, the Court will determine the issue as between all concerned. The same applies
to a question as to the rights of the trustees.

C. Distributions and Transactions from the Trust that Prejudice
Creditors and/or the Trustee's Indemnity
3-36

Where there is a better than speculative case that the trust was made for the purpose of
putting assets beyond the reach of the settlor's creditors by transferring assets to trustees
at undervalue,103 and within five years of the settlement the settlor is declared en désastre or the transfer caused him to become insolvent,104 then the position is more complex.
Article 17(1) of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990 authorises the Viscount to
make an application to the Court for an order restoring the position to what it would have
been if the debtor had not entered into the transaction. If the Court is satisfied that the
settlement was in good faith for the purpose of carrying on business and that there were
reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would be of benefit to the settlor at
the time the transaction was entered into, the Court will not make the order sought.105
The range of orders the Court can make are set out in Article 17(3) and include (at Article
17(3)(d)) a personal money order against the trustee even after distribution.106 An order
made under Article 17(1) may affect the property of or impose an obligation on any person,

person to pay in respect of a benefit received by him or her from the debtor such sum to the Viscount as the Court
directs. While a trustee does not 'benefit' in the sense that he receives only the legal title to the property subject to
the trust, the wording of Art 17(3) is wide and it is to be noted that the trustees receive the trust assets from the
settlor as principal, not merely in a ministerial capacity. The Court would be unlikely to make a personal money
order against the trustee if the trust assets or the beneficiaries who had received them from the trustee were available to make redress to the creditors, but if the trust assets and the beneficiaries had disappeared by the time the
creditors made their claim, then the only effective remedy would be one against the trustee, and that is precisely
what the trustee would be worried about.

trust that is the result of a settlement defrauding creditors would not come within the statutory exemption in Article 17(5). While they may acquire the distribution from the trustee
rather than the debtor and even if they receive it in good faith, they will not do so for value.
The purpose of seeking directions has nothing to do with any duty the trustee or beneficiaries may have to any external party to the trust and everything to do with the interaction of
a depletion of the trust fund with the trustee's entitlement to its indemnity. The principles
that govern the position where the trust fund is insufficient to satisfy the trustee's indemnity are discussed elsewhere.108
The authors' view is that the Court would likely be sympathetic to a trustee who made
an application to the Court in these circumstances, provided that he did not have reasonable grounds for suspicion that the trust was a device to defraud creditors at the time
when he first accepted office and was not aware that the settlement would cause the settlor
to become insolvent. Unless the Court is satisfied that no personal order could be made
against the trustee under Article 17(3)(d) of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990
following distribution, or that suitable arrangements had been made to protect the position of the trustee and possible future creditors following distribution, we would not expect
the Court to direct a distribution, even though that might mean that no distribution could
in the end take place (or at all) pending the outcome of the Viscount's application under
Article 17(1). Similar difficulties could arise in relation to a possible personal claim against
a trustee under Article 17A of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, though here
the problem is to degree less acute, owing to the shorter time limits which apply to such
claims.109

VI. Beddoe Proceedings
In the absence of an express provision in the terms of the trust authorising the trustee
to incur costs in the prosecution or defence of hostile proceedings with a third party (or
conceivably against co- or former trustee in default), without the blessing of the Court or
in the absence of the express consent of all the beneficiaries to that course, the trustee may
protect himself as regards the incidence of costs in those hostile proceedings by making an
application to court for directions under Article 51(1) as to whether or not it should litigate. A 'Beddoe Order' has been described as 'the only absolutely certain protection' that a
trustee or personal representative could obtain against the risk of having to pay, personally,
the costs of commencing or defending legal proceedings.110 The principle is as follows:111
But a trustee who, without the sanction of the Court, commences an action or defends an action
unsuccessfully, does so at his own risk as regards the costs, even if he acts on counsel's opinion;
and when the trustee seeks to obtain such costs out of his trust estate, he ought not to be allowed
to charge them against his cestui que trust unless under very exceptional circumstances. If, indeed,

the Judge comes to the conclusion that he would have authorized the action or defence had he been
applied to, he might, in the exercise of his discretion, allow the costs incurred by the trustee out of
the estate; but I cannot imagine any other circumstances under which the costs of an unauthorized
and unsuccessful action brought or defended by a trustee could be properly thrown on the estate …
I entirely agree that a trustee is entitled as of right to full indemnity out of his trust estate against
all his costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred: such an indemnity is the price paid by cestuis que trust for the gratuitous and onerous services of trustees; and in all cases of doubt, costs
incurred by a trustee ought to be borne by the trust estate and not by him personally …
But, considering the ease and comparatively small expense with which trustees can obtain the
opinion of a Judge of the Chancery Division on the question whether an action should be brought
or defended at the expense of the trust estate, I am of opinion that if a trustee brings or defends
an action unsuccessfully and without leave, it is for him to shew that the costs so incurred were
properly incurred. The fact that the trustee acted on counsel's opinion is in all cases a circumstance
which ought to weigh with the Court in favour of the trustee; but counsel's opinion is no indemnity
to him even on a question of costs.

3-40

Put plainly and in modern parlance, Beddoe relief predetermines, in advance, the question
of recovery of the costs of the conduct of the main proceedings (including the trustee's
liability in those proceedings for adverse costs) from the trust fund by way of indemnity to
the trustee as between the trustee and the beneficiaries.112 Beddoe relief does not predetermine the incidence of costs in the main proceedings for which the relief has been sought.
An application to the Royal Court for directions as to taking or defending legal proceedings involving the trust and third parties under the Court's Beddoe113 jurisdiction can
conceivably be made under Article 51(1) although the scope of the relief that the Royal
Court may give in a Beddoe application is more limited than that under Article 51(1). A
Beddoe application could conceivably fall into either the second or the third of the In Re
S Settlement categories, depending on whether (1) the trustees resolved to proceed with
the proceedings but seek the Court's blessing for the purposes of protecting themselves
from personal cost exposure in the event the claim fails; or (2) they have not made up
their mind and wish the Court to direct them what to do in the circumstances. Where it
is not realistic to expect the beneficiaries to fight the case (eg where the trust is entirely
discretionary and no one yet has any interest in possession) the trustees may be directed
to defend the trust itself.
Is Beddoe relief required where the litigation is being conducted by or against a
company owned by the trust, as distinct from litigation conducted by or against the trustee?
Ordinarily, whether a company should litigate is a question for the directors of the company rather than its shareholder (the trustee). Where the company does resolve to litigate,
the issue is not the trustee's indemnity in respect of the litigation because the trustee, qua
shareholder, incurs no personally liability in respect of the costs of the litigation. The only

circumstances where it may be appropriate for the trustee to apply for directions in relation
to proceedings brought by or against a company in which the trust has an interest are:
1.

where the company is impecunious and unable to afford the cost of the litigation and
the trustee is considering whether to fund or contribute to the cost of the litigation out
of the other trust assets; or
whether the trustee should exercise its rights qua shareholder to intervene in the management of the company in regard to the litigation in the interests of the beneficiaries
of the trust.

2.

It is inappropriate for a co- or former trustee, sued by beneficiaries or by a co- or successor
trustee for breach of trust, to apply for Beddoe relief. The position of the defendant trustee
is not analogous to that of a trustee sued by a third party to the trust because the defendant
trustee, if guilty of a breach of trust, is not entitled to an indemnity from the fund to defend
themselves.114

3-43

A. Procedure to Apply for Beddoe Relief
Beddoe proceedings are commenced by Representation as a free-standing set of proceedings set apart from the main hostile action to which they relate.115 The Representation,
when called on in Samedi Court, is usually requested bas de la liste so as to preserve confidentiality as to what the proceedings are about. The Representation needs to be supported
by a detailed affidavit sworn on behalf of the trustee. Exhibited to the affidavit should be:
1.

The pleadings in the main action (or the draft pleadings proposed to be served if the
trustee is to be the plaintiff in the main action).
An opinion from a suitably qualified lawyer116 setting out the merits of the claim(s)
proposed to be brought or defended in the main action (including the instructions to
counsel if the advice is given on formal instructions).117
Full and frank disclosure of all relevant matters that go to the strengths and weaknesses
of the action in the main proceedings.118
A costs budget or estimate the main action.
Any known facts concerning the means of the opposite party.
Evidence concerning the value, nature and liquidity of the trust fund.
The significance of the main action to the trust/estate and why the Court's directions
are needed.
Whether the trustees have proposed or undertaken, or intend to propose, mediation/
ADR, and if not, why not.

3-45

3-46

In convening parties to the Representation, all the trustees (if more than one) should be
convened as a party to the proceedings, either as representors or respondents. Any person
with an interest in the Beddoe proceedings or an interest in the trust, may also be convened
as a party by the trustee. Beneficiaries are usually necessary parties to the Beddoe application because they are entitled to be heard on whether trust money should be spent or placed
at risk in the main action. In simple cases, or in cases where the known beneficiaries are of
full age and capacity and have given informed consents to the course of action proposed by
the trustee and there are unborn or unascertained beneficiaries then the Court may be able
to assess what directions to give without convening any party other than the trustee. If there
are only two views of the appropriate course to take in the proposed litigation, and one is
advocated by one beneficiary who is opposed to the trustee's view, that beneficiary should
be joined. It may not be necessary for other beneficiaries to be joined, as the beneficiary who
is convened or the trustees may be able to present the other arguments.120 If the trustees
are unsure as to who should be joined, the trustee should seek a direction from the Court
as to whom it should convene as parties in the prayer for relief.121 In deciding who to join
as a party to a Beddoe application the trustees should remain neutral and should not come
across as partisan by seeking to avoid joining beneficiaries whose view does not accord with
the trustees' as to the appropriate course to be adopted in respect of the main action.
Any beneficiary who is an opposing party in the main action would usually be joined to
the Beddoe proceeding but excluded from a hearing in which the trustee discusses the
strengths and weaknesses of its case in the proposed litigation.122 Before the opposing party
withdraws, the trustee should give a précis of the facts, excluding the matters that will be
mentioned to the Court in private, and the opponent should be allowed to comment on
the facts. All the parties to the application should have an opportunity to file their own evidence. Material that would be privileged as against the beneficiary in the main proceedings
may be withheld in the course of the Beddoe proceedings. Privilege will not be lost in any
material placed before the Court in Beddoe proceedings.123

for directions. Where the trust is charitable, the trustee is expected to have canvassed the view of the AG.

Beddoe Proceedings

143

C. The Beddoe Court
The Master does not have jurisdiction to determine a Beddoe application which must be
listed and heard before the Inferior Number.124 The usual practice is that the Court will sit
in private to hear the application.125 This explains why, unfortunately, there is not a great
deal of reported Jersey cases on Beddoe applications. It is a contempt of court to disclose
without the leave of the Court any documents that a party receives in the course of proceedings for Beddoe relief such as affidavits, exhibits, skeleton arguments, notes of the content
of the hearing and the judgment of the Court) save to the extent that the party in possession of such documents has them independently of those proceedings.126 In the course of
a Beddoe application the trustee is expected to give full and frank disclosure of all relevant
matters that go to the strengths and weaknesses of the action in the main proceedings and
the Court will be privy to information that it would not normally be presented in the course
of hostile proceedings. For this reason neither the presiding judge nor the Jurats in a Beddoe application may sit to hear the main action. The Court that grants the trustee Beddoe
relief will remain permanently constituted until the main proceedings are concluded so as
to allow the trustee to return to it for directions as to what further steps it should take (while
protected by the indemnity) during the course of the main proceedings.

3-47

D. Costs of Beddoe Proceedings
Whether the Beddoe application authorises the trustee to proceed or is dismissed, the costs
of Beddoe proceeding itself is usually ordered to be met as an expense of the administration of the trust and allowed on a full indemnity basis and a direction to that effect should
normally be included as an item in the prayer to the Representation.127

3-48

E. Outcome of the Beddoe Proceedings
In granting Beddoe relief, the Court is taking a calculated risk, on the basis of the evidence before it of the outcome of the main action for which the relief is sought and the
likely cost consequences of those main proceedings. The Court will rarely grant a trustee
blanket approval for it to take such steps and spend what trust money as it pleases in the
main action. To do so would be to grant the trustee a blank cheque without effective oversight.128 A Beddoe order will contain a direction for the trustee to file a periodic written
report with the Court at particular milestones in the main action and in any event to issue
a summons for further directions on the occurrence of any event that might reasonably

impact upon the prospects of success in the main action. If the Beddoe application is
dismissed, the trustees cannot proceed to litigate at the expense of the trust. If the trustee
does proceed in the main action, this will be at their own risk as to costs and at their own
expense without recourse to the statutory entitlement to an indemnity (unless they subsequently receive an indemnity from any beneficiary). A trustee is not to be penalised or
disentitled to its costs in the main action for not having not sought Beddoe relief.129

VII. Procedure in Proceedings to Obtain Directions under
Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
A. Commencing Proceedings
3-50

3-51

Proceedings for directions are commenced by way of Representation.130 For those without
automatic131 locus, the Representation lodged with the Judicial Greffe must be accompanied by an affidavit in support of an application for leave to bring the proceedings, which
is made orally at the first Samedi Court hearing. In considering whether leave should be
granted, the Court will take into account (1) the justice of the case, including the interests
of both the applicant and the prospective respondents to the proceedings; (2) public policy,
which requires that a person with no legitimate interest in so doing should not be entitled
to bring proceedings concerning a trust; and (3) the need for the applicant to show a good
arguable case on the substantive issues to be raised, going beyond the existence of a mere
prima facie case.132
The proceedings should be headed 'IN THE MATTER OF [named] TRUST' and 'IN THE
MATTER OF ARTICLE 51 OF THE TRUSTS (JERSEY) LAW 1984'. The Representation
and any supporting application or material in support of the Representation should be
deposited with the Judicial Greffe by midday on the Thursday before the usual Friday sitting of the Samedi division in the usual way.133 The prayer setting out the relief sought in
the proceedings can be lengthy, setting out not only the substantive relief sought (ie a determination on the issue that has precipitated the Representation) but also directions as to the
convening of parties, the making of Representation orders,134 orders for the appointment
of a guardians ad litem, service135 of the Representation,136 the filing and service of evidence
and other material and directions as to how the Representation is to proceed to a final
hearing. When the matter is called on at the Samedi division hearing, the Court will give
directions for the disposal or future conduct of the proceeding as appear to it appropriate.

Procedure to Obtain Directions

145

B. Parties
If there is more than one trustee, all the trustees must be made parties to the Representation. Where the trustee is bringing the action (eg under Article 51(1), where only a trustee
can bring the action), and a co-trustee does not wish to be joined as a representor, he must
be joined as a respondent. A person who has more than one capacity should not appear
more than once on the face of the Representation. Beneficiaries are usually convened to
proceedings for directions for two reasons: (1) they are likely to have information that will
be material to the application such as an opinion on how the trustee should proceed; and
(2) it may be unfair to make a decision without allowing that opinion to be put to Court.137
Not all the beneficiaries need to be convened to the proceedings; the Court may order such
of them to be convened as may be appropriate having regard to the nature of the relief
sought. For example, where the animus for the application is that the trustee is faced with
a dilemma as to what it should do and there are only two views of the appropriate course,
one of which is advocated by a beneficiary who will be joined, it may be unnecessary to join
any other beneficiary since the trustees may be able to represent the other view138 (without,
presumably, compromising their position as to costs). This approach is not appropriate
when the Representation involves the determination of rights rather than a choice on a
particular course; in such a case it seems that all those interested must either be parties or
be represented by a party joined to the proceedings.139 Representations are conventionally
commenced ex parte. Where the trustee has any doubts as to which beneficiaries should be
convened (eg if there is a large class of discretionary beneficiaries) they may combine the
first Samedi division hearing of the Representation with an application for directions as to
joinder of parties or giving service of the proceedings to those interested under the trust to
allow them to seek to be joined if they so wish. The Court may theoretically dispense with
hearing from any other party than the trustee. This procedure may enable trustees to obtain
directions where the expense and delay associated with proceedings convening other parties may not be in the interests of beneficiaries. The procedure may be useful where the fund
is small, or where the principal beneficiaries are adults and agreeable to the course proposed
and the other beneficiaries are unborn, unascertained or cannot be found. It may also be
useful where the trustees are under such severe time constraint that the Court's decision is
required before beneficiaries can be joined and heard.140

3-52

C. Representation Orders
Under rule 4/4 RCR 2004 the Court may appoint one or more persons to represent any person (including an unborn person) or class of persons who is or may be interested (whether
presently or for any future, contingent or unascertained interest) in, or affected by proceedings concerning, property subject to a trust. The Court may exercise its jurisdiction under

rule 4/4 if it is expedient to do so and one of the conditions in rule 4/4(2) RCR 2004 is
satisfied. A judgment or court order under rule 4/4(1) RCR 2004 shall be binding on the
person or class represented by the person or persons so appointed. The conditions in rule
4/4(2) RCR 2004 are that the person, class or some member of the class sought to be represented, cannot be ascertained or, cannot readily be ascertained or even if ascertainable,
cannot be found. Alternatively, that person, class or some member of the class sought to
be represented are ascertainable and can be found, it is otherwise expedient, to make the
order for the purposes of saving expense. A beneficiary is to be ascertainable by reference to
either a class of persons (which itself must be ascertainable) or by reference to a relationship to some person, whether or not living, at the date of the trust's creation or at the time
which under the terms of the trust is the time by reference to which members of a class are
to be determined.141 Where the representation will determine legal rights, it is necessary to
ensure that all interested persons are represented if they are not made parties. A representation order142 is useful when there are large numbers of beneficiaries with the same interest,
as in the case of wide discretionary trusts. If it is difficult to find a member of the class willing or suitable to act as a representative defendant, it is possible to appoint another person
as representative defendant, for instance one of the solicitors involved.143 On an application
for directions in the narrow sense, ie one as to the exercise of trustees' powers not involving
any determination of legal rights, it seems that representation orders are not necessary but
can in any event be applied for.144 Factors which are likely to weigh in favour of the expediency of a representation order are: the absolute number of beneficiaries and whether the
beneficiaries can be divided into classes who have the same interest.

D. Evidence
3-54

A trustee will only be protected from liability for breach of trust by acting in accordance
with the Court's directions if he has made full and frank disclosure of all relevant circumstances; this is so even if the action is to proceed with the participation of beneficiaries as
defendants.145 Written evidence should be given by way of affidavit.146 A trustee may be
refused its costs from the fund if it fails to make disclosure of all relevant information to the
Court.147 A trustee who seeks the directions of the Court and convenes beneficiaries must
provide sufficient material in order for the beneficiaries to make informed submissions.148

the trust and why the Court's directions are needed. The affidavit should explain what
consultation, if any, there has been and its result. Where the beneficiaries principally concerned are not numerous and are all or mainly adult, identified and traceable, the trustees
are expected to have canvassed the proposed or possible course of action with all the adult
beneficiaries or, if there are numerous beneficiaries (including those not yet born or identified, or minors), then with the principal adult beneficiaries. Where the trust is charitable
the trustees must have consulted the Attorney General.149 If a minor beneficiary is a party to
the representation, the Court will expect to have put before it the instructions to and advice
of an appropriately qualified lawyer150 as to the benefits and disadvantages to the child of
the proposed course of action by the trustee and any other possible course. The duty of
giving instructions will ordinarily be performed by the child's guardian ad litem.151
It will rarely be in the interests of justice for trustees, in the course of obtaining directions
from the Court, to be required to disclose all of their communications with their advisors in
the context of those proceedings. Trustees are often faced with difficult situations in which
they were entitled to seek the guidance and protection of the Court, which involved obtaining legal advice. The Court has expressed it to be important that they should not be inhibited
in their communications with their advisors by the fear that they would be required to disclose those communications to beneficiaries convened to the directions hearing (although
disclosure of such communications could be required in certain circumstances, eg if the
conduct of the trustee in bringing the directions application were impugned).

VIII. Costs of Proceedings under Article 51
The costs of proceedings for directions where the parties do not include strangers to the
trust or trustees or beneficiaries claiming otherwise than in that capacity, is a matter of some
complexity. It is not the case that all parties can expect their costs to be met by the trust fund
and it is obviously incumbent upon lawyers advising parties as to the costs risks.152

A. Statutory Provisions as to the Incidence of Costs

expenses of and incidental to an application to the Court under the 1984 Law to be raised

149 Jersey does not yet have a regulatory body for charitable trusts, like the UK's Charity Commission part of
whose role is to supervise charities' activities. The Charities (Jersey) Law 2014 establishes, for the first time, an
office of Charity Commissioner who will maintain a register of Jersey charities but the Commissioner will have no
jurisdiction equivalent to that in s 115 of the Charities Act 2011 and no consent need be sought.

1956 which provides that the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the Royal Court
shall be in the discretion of the Court, and the Court shall have full power to determine by
whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.

B. The Trustee's Indemnity for Costs Reasonably Incurred
3-58

The trustee's usual right of indemnity for costs reasonably incurred154 applies to orders for
costs in proceedings for directions under Article 51. The general rule, not peculiar to the
right of indemnity concerning litigation costs, is that a trustee is entitled to a full indemnity
from the trust fund in respect of costs and expenses properly incurred by him in connection
with the performance of his duties and exercise of his powers and discretions as a trustee.
This general principle of trust law extends to costs incurred in litigation concerning the
trust.155 The trustee's right of indemnity in respect of litigation costs extents only to costs
properly incurred in the execution of the trust, ie costs that are honestly and reasonably
incurred.156 Doubt is to be resolved in favour of the trustee,157 ie the trustee is entitled
to costs not improperly incurred. It will come as little surprise that the costs of defending hostile proceedings for breach of trust are not to be borne by the trust fund by way of
an indemnity but by the trustee personally on the usual basis.158 The trustee's right to an
indemnity can be lost or curtailed or an order for costs made against him personally where
the trustee has conducted himself in a manner that is contrary to his duty. Misconduct in
this context includes caprice, obstinacy, negligence or carelessness and dishonesty is not
required.159 A trustee may also be deprived of costs or have an order for costs made against
them by reason of his unreasonable conduct in proceedings,160 for example taking a step
that needlessly increases costs,161 failing to give the Court the request disclosure of information,162 by acting in a partisan fashion by siding with some beneficiaries and not others,163

153 The discretion under Art 53 may only be overturned on appeal if (1) the judge misdirected himself as to
applicable principles; (2) irrelevant matters were taken into account or relevant matters not taken into account;
(3) the decision was plainly wrong; or (4) there has been a material change of circumstances; In re J.P. Morgan

by involving itself in claims that ought to be made by others164 or not at all.165 Where a
court order is silent as to costs or there is no order for costs, no party is entitled to their costs
in relation to that order but this does not affect the entitlement of a party to recover costs of
a fund held by him as trustee (which arises as a matter of general law).166 If a trustee is to be
deprived of his costs from the trust fund, this must be expressly provided for in any order.

C. Types of Proceedings Brought under Article 51 and their
Respective Costs Treatment
The classification of litigation involving trustees described by Lightman J at the start of this
chapter in the English case of Alsop Wilkinson v Neary167 is instructive and a sound basis for
analysis of the cost burden in a range of trust proceedings before the Royal Court. Without
wishing to oversimplify matters, and stating that the classification of proceedings is more
an art than a science, the main types of proceedings falling within the first two of Lightman
LJ's categories can be distilled further, into the following five categories which all engage the
Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 51:
1.

3-59

Category 1: Proceedings for the construction of the trust instrument or determination
of questions of law as to the validity or scope of trusts or powers.
Category 2: Proceedings for directions in the administration of the trust.
Category 3: Proceedings for the vindication of the beneficiaries rights against the trustee, such as the provision of accounts, the provision of information or distribution of
the fund.
Category 4: Proceedings commenced by the trustee for relief from the consequences of
the no-conflict and no-profit rules.
Category 5: Proceedings for the removal of trustees.

Proceedings for the construction of the trust instrument or determination of questions of
law as to the validity or scope of trusts or powers or for directions in the administration
of the trust (categories 1 and 2 above) are divisible, for costs purposes, into three further
categories named 'the Buckton categories' after the English decision from which they are
derived:168

guidance as to the construction of the trust instrument or some other question of law

property is held.169 In these cases, the costs of all parties are, whatever the outcome,
usually treated as necessarily incurred for the benefit of the trust fund and ordered to
be paid out of it. The trustee is at risk as to costs if he commences a construction claim
unnecessarily, though will be protected if it does so on advice.170
Buckton Category 2: Proceedings in which the application is made by someone other
than the trustee, but raises the same kind of issue as in Buckton category 1 and would
have justified an application by the trustee.171 While differing in form, such proceedings do not differ in substance from the category one and similar considerations therefore apply as to costs.
Buckton Category 3: Proceedings in which the application is made by someone other
than the trustee, and differs in substance and form from Buckton categories 1 and 2
in that they have the character of a hostile claim founded on a point of construction
or law raised by someone other than the trustee to a beneficial interest in or entitlement to the trust fund. While on paper apparently clearly distinguishable from either
Buckton category 1 or 2, in practice the line may not be easy to draw. The difference,
between this kind of litigation and litigation within the first two categories, is that the
claim is brought not in substance for the benefit of the trust fund, but for the benefit
of the plaintiff. A case which falls clearly within the third category is where the whole
of the trust fund has been distributed to a supposed beneficiary in reliance on some
construction of the trust instrument, or view of the law, and another person claiming
to be the true beneficiary brings proceedings against the recipient or the trustee in reliance on a rival construction, or rival view of the law. In Buckton category 3 cases the
general principles as to costs of hostile litigation apply between the plaintiff and the
party against whom the claim is directed; the unsuccessful party will usually be ordered
to pay the successful party's costs subject to the general qualifications which apply in
ordinary hostile litigation.172

The Buckton categories are not closed.173 We can also add a fourth category of proceedings
that are conceptually distinct from the categories already enumerated above but which also
engage the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. An example of this fourth category of would
be proceedings commenced by the trustee but having the quality of Buckton Category 3
proceedings, ie where the issue is not so much the construction of the trust instrument but
a dispute over the beneficial ownership of the trust fund.174 Where, for example, there is
a hostile dispute between two persons who claim to be the true owner of the trust property and the trustee intervenes by seeking the determination by the Court of the construction of the trust deed on the issue as for whom he holds the fund. Although in form the

to determine the proper construction of a mandatory dividend provision in articles of association of a company
wholly owned by the trustee were, despite the differences between the parties, held to be non-adversarial proceedings concerning the proper administration of the trust.

proceedings come within Buckton category 1, in substance the dispute comes within Buckton category 3, and the costs of the rival claimants to the fund should be governed by the
principles of cases falling within the third category (that costs follow the event and that the
losing party should pay the costs of the winning party and the trustee, the trustee being
entitled to indemnity in respect of his costs so far as not recovered from the losing party,
subject to the trustee behaving unreasonably.

i. Buckton Category 1: Beneficiaries' Costs in Proceedings for the Construction
of the Trust Instrument, Determination of Questions of Law and the Scope
of Powers
Beneficiaries' costs will normally be ordered to be paid out of the trust fund in cases falling within Buckton categories 1 and 2, whatever the outcome.175 That is on the basis that
such costs are incurred for the benefit of the trust as a whole. Such costs are often assessed
on a full indemnity basis under Article 53, rather like the trustee's indemnity rather than
the indemnity basis under rule 12/5 RCR 2004.176 In cases within Buckton category 3, the
unsuccessful beneficiary will normally be ordered to pay the costs of the successful beneficiary on the same basis as in any other kind of hostile proceedings. But it does not necessarily follow that just because the proceedings come within Buckton categories 1 or 2 an order
for costs out of the trust fund will be made in favour of unsuccessful beneficiaries. Since
beneficiaries are awarded costs by analogy to the trustees' right of indemnity, beneficiaries
are subject to the same requirement of reasonableness as applies to trustees.177 Beneficiaries
should not be joined unnecessarily,178 and respondent beneficiaries have been disallowed
their costs where they chose to be represented in court though their claims were hopeless.179

3-62

a. Trustee Neutrality and Costs
Where proceedings for directions have a hostile character as between different parties convened to the proceedings, the proper course of the trustee, if it wishes to preserve its entitlement to costs on the indemnity basis, is to remain neutral as between the competing
beneficiaries or persons who claim to be beneficiaries. Such proceedings might for example
arise where the trustee has distributed the whole or part of the trust fund on an alleged
misconstruction of the trust instrument or a misinterpretation of the law.180 Provided that
a trustee conducts himself in the proceedings in a neutral fashion, his right of indemnity
is secure.181 A trustee who takes the side of some beneficiaries against others is at risk of
being held to have acted unreasonably and so deprived itself of the indemnity, and may be
ordered to pay costs of the successful beneficiary.

b. Costs of Appeals from Proceedings for the Construction of the Trust Instrument,
Determination of Questions of Law and the Scope of Powers
3-64

3-65

3-66

The traditional orthodoxy was that a trustee should not appeal a decision of the Court
made under the supervisory jurisdiction. Having come to court with a question and
in seeking an order to protect and indemnify it, the trustee should be satisfied with the
Court's answer.182 A trustee who appeals an order made in proceedings concerning the
construction of the trust and similar proceedings does so at his own risk as to costs, and will
normally be ordered to pay costs if the appeal fails183 absent special circumstances.184
The costs of the other parties to the appeal, even if they were unsuccessful, might also be
regarded as incurred for the benefit of the estate, although it should not be assumed that
that would always be appropriate.185 It has been said by the Guernsey Court of Appeal, the
leading judgment being given by the then Bailiff of Jersey, that if the trustee considers that
the decision at first instance is not in the best interests of the beneficiaries (not merely that
it is incorrect), he may and should appeal and that if the appeal failed an adverse order for
costs would be made against him only if he had acted unreasonably.186
If a beneficiary successfully appeals in a case which falls within Buckton category 1 or 2,
the costs of all parties will normally be paid out of the trust fund.187 If the appeal fails, the
appellant beneficiary will normally be ordered to pay costs of the respondents on the standard basis, with the respondent trustee entitled to the difference between its costs on the
standard basis and indemnity basis out of the trust fund.188 But in special circumstances the
Court of Appeal may allow the appellant beneficiary's costs (as well as costs of other parties) out of the trust fund, and such circumstances will arise if large interests are at stake and
the Court of Appeal is satisfied that the point in the appeal admits of sufficient difficulty as
to make it proper for a second opinion to be taken.189 In Trilogy Management v YT & Ors,
the Court permitted the losing trustee respondent its costs on the indemnity from the fund
rather than the standard basis citing that the question before it was one arising in respect
of the proper administration of the trust, and that it was reasonable for Trilogy to seek to
uphold the decision of the Royal Court. Trilogy's position was not an ordinary adversarial
one of seeking to gain an advantage.
A beneficiary wishing to guard against the risk that, in the event his appeal fails, the costs
of the appeal will fall to him may wish to make arrangements with the other respondents, including the trustee, that he will ask the Court to make only one order for costs
against him where that the appeal can be determined without submissions from the
trustees and without the need for representation of respondent beneficiaries who share the
same interest as the appellant.

Costs of Proceedings under Article 51

153

The Royal Court has said that where there is an appeal by a party other than the trustee, from
a decision of the Royal Court following a surrender of the trustee's discretion on the basis
that the Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, it was in principle appropriate for the trustee,
from among the respondents, where the trustee's stance on the issues dividing the other
parties is neutral, to make such arguments as could properly be made in opposition to the
appeal. The Court was entitled to expect the fullest assistance from a trustee, who should
ensure that all relevant law was placed before the Court and that all arguments for and
against the various possible courses of action were rehearsed. The Court would usually be
assisted if a trustee recommended a particular course of action and explained the reasons
for its recommendation. It would not be in the public interest for trustees to be discouraged
from making recommendations for fear of being penalised in costs merely if the Court were
to decide against their recommendation.190

3-67

ii. Buckton Category 2: Proceedings in which Directions Are Sought for the
Guidance of the Trustee in the Administration or Execution of the Trust
Proceedings of this kind are similar in character to proceedings falling within Buckton categories 1 and 2. They typically involve a question as to how a trustee should proceed in the
light of facts presented to the Court rather than a question of law or construction. Beddoe
applications are a common proceeding of this kind. If brought by a trustee in his capacity as such (or beneficiaries) for the guidance or proper protection of the trustees in the
administration of the trust, such an application falls within Buckton category 1 (or 2), so
that normally the costs of all parties are paid out of the trust fund on a full indemnity basis.
If all the beneficiaries are of full age and capacity and have the same view on a question
of administration, a trustee who nonetheless proceeds for directions is likely to be acting
without due cause and may be penalised in costs for which it will not be permitted recourse
to the fund. A trustee will have proper cause to seek directions under this category where
minor or unascertained beneficiaries are interested. A trustee who makes an application for
directions having disregarded his duties as trustee and in circumstances where the application would or might not have been required had the trustee acted conscientiously as a trustee, may be deprived of costs.191 In a case where a trustee makes an application for directions as a result of the conduct of a disaffected beneficiary who appears intent on disrupting
the administration of the trust, the disaffected beneficiary is at risk of being deprived of
his costs and at worst of being ordered to pay all the costs of the application which was
made necessary by reason of his conduct.192 However, a beneficiary who makes a bona fides
claim against the trustees in third party proceedings should not be deprived of costs (nor
be ordered to pay costs) of the Beddoe application itself, by reason only that he has commenced the claim and therefore necessitated the Beddoe application.193 An application may
be made for a pre-emptive costs order in respect of the costs of trustees or beneficiaries of
an application to the Court for directions concerning the administration of the trust.194

iii. Buckton Category 3 Proceedings for the Accounts, the Provision of
Information to Beneficiaries or Distribution of the Fund
3-69

There is a very fine line between a claim for breach of trust and proceedings in which beneficiaries claim to enforce their rights against the trustee in the administration or execution
of the trust. This category of case is concerned with beneficiaries who complain of the acts
or (more usually) omissions of the trustee, without seeking to restrain commission of a
breach of trust, or compensation for breach of trust, or to recover trust property allegedly
wrongly misappropriated by the trustee. The general principle is that the trustee's right of
indemnity applies so as to entitle the trustee to its costs out of the trust fund even if he is
unsuccessful. However, if the trustee has been guilty of misconduct, that is if he acts unreasonably in the proceedings, or his unreasonable conduct occasions the proceedings, the
trustee will be deprived of costs or ordered to pay costs.195 The operative principle is somewhat different from that applicable to disputes founded on breach of trust.196 Where a trust
fund proves deficient to pay all the costs, a trustee may lose the priority over beneficiaries
to which he would otherwise be entitled having regard to his conduct.197 The cases within
category 3 may conveniently be sub-divided into three groups: (1) claims for production of
accounts or information by the trustee; (2) claims in respect of money due from the trustee;
and (3) claims for enforcement of beneficiaries' rights to distribution of capital or income

iv. Claims against the Trustee for the Production of Accounts or
Information about the Trust
3-70

A trustee must be prepared to account for its stewardship of the trust property at any given
point in time. A trustee who indefensibly fails to produce accounts may be ordered to pay
not only the costs of proceedings to obtain the accounts, but also the costs of taking the
account which is ordered.198 Where the trustee's neglect is only slight, the Court may be
content to deprive the trustee of costs without ordering him to pay costs.199 Where the
cause of a trustee's failure to account is a trustee's negligence, a claim for a contribution
between two or more trustees who are in default of their duty of care, may be possible.200
Before the seminal Privy Council decision of Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd,201 trustees
were ordered to pay costs where they unreasonably failed to provide information to which
the plaintiff beneficiary was entitled,202 though in a case where the plaintiff beneficiary

commenced proceedings with unreasonable haste, the Court made no order for costs.203
While it has been held that beneficiaries do not now have an absolute entitlement to disclosure of documents or information about the trust,204 our view is that the same principles as to costs apply as before Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd in cases where there is no
reasonable doubt that the discretion should be exercised by ordering the disclosure sought
by the plaintiff. Where there is a reasonable doubt whether a beneficiary should be given
the disclosure sought, the prudent course is for the trustee to take the initiative and seek
the Court's determination on the matter, under Article 51, in which case it is likely that the
proceedings will fall within Buckton category 1 so as to entitle the trustee to costs even if the
decision goes against them in favour of the requesting beneficiary.205 Requests for information by beneficiaries are often an early warning sign of a claim for breach of trust or actions
seeking the removal or replacement of the trustee(s). Trustees may be naturally concerned
that by providing beneficiaries with information, they may be providing the beneficiaries
with a rod to later beat them with, with the disclosed material subsequently used against the
trustee. While that might be a legitimate concern, a trustee must be cautious in responding
to requests for information in these circumstances. If the trustee is perceived as conducting
himself in an obstructive fashion, and not for the benefit of the trust, he increases his cost
risk in the proceedings for disclosure.

v. Proceedings Commenced by the Trustee for Relief from the Consequences
of the No-Conflict and No-Profit Rules
Proceedings seeking relief for self-dealing or other profits from the trust are likewise matters of administration and are subject to the same considerations. Proceedings commenced
by beneficiaries seeking to assert a personal or proprietary remedy in respect of any profit
or loss arising from a self-dealing transaction are properly to be regarded as hostile proceedings and subject to the usual rule that costs follow the event.206

3-71

vi. Proceedings for the Removal of Trustees
The Court's inherent and statutory jurisdiction in proceedings for or concerning the
removal of trustees is a question arising in the administration or execution of the trust.
Except in the exceptional cases where the basis of the application for the trustee's removal
is not contested (such as where the trustee has disappeared),207 contested proceedings
to remove the trustee, or proceedings necessitated by a trustee's unreasonable refusal to
resign208 are likely to follow the usual rule that costs follow the event.209

vii. Pre-emptive Costs Orders for Beneficiaries
3-73

3-74

3-75

Beneficiaries who are convened to Article 51 proceedings are often concerned that any costs
incurred by them in participating actively in the proceedings should come not from their
own pockets but be borne by the trust fund. In all probability the proceedings are likely to
be classified as coming within Buckton category 1 or 2 and that in accordance with settled
practice the Court can be expected to exercise its discretion to award them their costs out of
the trust fund on a full indemnity basis. Such reassurance may be insufficient to persuade
beneficiaries to participate actively in the proceedings, since ultimately costs are a matter of the Court's discretion and cannot be guaranteed.210 Further, even if persuaded, the
beneficiaries may not be able to obtain legal advice and representation without making a
substantial personal payment on account.211
A pre-emptive or prospective costs order is one whereby a party is granted an order in
advance of the trial to ensure that his costs will be paid from the trust fund on a full indemnity basis in any event. A prospective costs order is what a trustee is granted who seeks and
is granted Beddoe relief. In England, the courts have made clear that such orders in favour
of a beneficiaries are only made in narrow circumstances and the Court must be satisfied
that the beneficiary would in any event receive a costs order in his favour at the conclusion
of the proceedings.212 In effect, for a beneficiary to obtain a pre-emptive costs order the
beneficiaries need to be performing the same functions as the trustee in the proceedings
or at least assisting the trustee.213 Applying the orthodox English law analysis, a prospective costs order may be granted in favour of (1) a trustee or other fiduciary on a Beddoe
application; (2) trustees and representative beneficiaries in proceedings coming within
Buckton category 1 or 2; and (3) beneficiaries in hostile pension scheme litigation.214 However, where trustees have power to agree to indemnify a beneficiary who is a party to the
proceedings for their costs, and properly exercise such a power, there is usually no need for
the beneficiaries to make an application for a prospective costs order. The English courts
have resolutely refused to countenance the possibility of a pre-emptive costs order in respect
of Buckton category 3 proceedings other than in pensions litigation.215
It would appear that the position in Jersey is somewhat more flexible. In certain unusual
circumstances the Royal Court has granted a prospective costs order to beneficiaries bringing an action to challenge the propriety of an action taken by the trustees (even where
the Court cannot be satisfied that the trial judge would make such an order) and there
are obiter indications that the Royal Court will not rule out an extension of the circumstances in which a prospective costs order may be awarded in the future.216 In re X Trust, the

Costs of Proceedings under Article 51

beneficiaries brought a derivative action against the incumbent trustee alleging it had acted
in breach of trust. The derivative action was advanced on the basis that as the incumbent
trustee, the trustee was conflicted and could not pursue itself. By reference to the principles
governing the exercise of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction over trusts, the Court held
that there was no logical reason why the exercise of the jurisdiction should not extend
to the Court's discretion in an appropriate case to making an order that the costs of the
action against the trustee be met from the fund. In the exercise of the discretion the Court
would have regard to the interests of the different beneficiaries, or conceivably the interests
of beneficiaries and third parties to the fund. The existence of a contractual nexus (such
as in a pension scheme case) may add to the weight in favour of making an order but the
absence of such a nexus was not to imply that the beneficiaries have no right to the good
administration of the trust. The question is whether the order sought is in the best interest of the fund and the beneficiaries as a whole. In authorising a prospective costs order
in a derivative action claim, the Court is effectively awarding what would be equivalent
of Beddoe-type relief had the trustee applied instead. The full ramifications of the X Trust
decision have yet to be explored and there is recent authority that appears wedded to the
English, more restrictive orthodoxy.217 It is to be noted that in Crociani v Crociani,218 the
Royal Court observed that an application for a prospective costs order by beneficiaries (not
by way of a derivative action) against the trustee seeking reconstitution of the fund was not
bound to fail.

D. The Taxation of Costs in Proceedings Commenced under Article 51
The incidence of costs arising from proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction or Article
51 depends upon the role the trustee plays in the course of the proceedings. The Royal
Court Rules 2004 contain provisions as to the taxation of costs in Part 12. The trustee
indemnity for the costs and expenses of administering the trust (including any legal costs
incurred in the course of administration, are not to be confused with the indemnity basis
of taxation of litigation costs under Part 12 of the Royal Court Rules 2004.219 The procedure for the taxation of costs on the indemnity basis is specifically designed for taxation of
awards of costs on a party to party basis in hostile litigation, while the trustee's indemnity
for costs is a matter purely internal to the trust. The Judicial Greffier will not apply the
Factor 'A' and Factor 'B' rates.220 Most (if not all) of the detailed provisions of Part 12 of
the RCR do not therefore apply to the taxation of a trustee's costs in an application for
directions, as they apply between a paying and a receiving party rather than trustee in
administrative proceedings.

217 In Trilogy Management v YT & Ors (n 211), the Court refused to make a prospective costs order in favour
of a third party to the trust who had already been granted a pre-emptive costs order in respect of a construction
dispute involving the same trust on the basis that it was by no means clear that the third party would be ordered
her costs at trial (although acknowledging the breadth of the jurisdiction to be wide).

The guidance provided to the Greffier in the taxation of a trustee's costs in this context is
as follows:221
1.

the scales applicable on a normal taxation of costs were not relevant to a taxation of
a neutral trustee's entitlement to recover his costs and expenses from the trust fund;
a trustee's duty included an obligation to consider whether the charges of a particular
lawyer or firm of lawyers were appropriate both to the nature of the problem and the
size of the trust fund. It was also desirable, in appropriate cases of complex trust litigation, for specialist legal advice to be obtained from English solicitors and Chancery
counsel and a trustee could recover the reasonable costs so incurred;222
when considering legal costs, the Greffier should concentrate on whether a particular
matter was one upon which it was reasonable to spend time and whether the degree of
time spent was reasonable;
the test was not whether the Greffier considered that the costs were incurred at the correct level, but whether they were reasonably incurred; and
the taxation process should be exercised against the background of the general rule that
a trustee acting reasonably was entitled to a full indemnity out of the trust fund. Costs
or expenses could only be disallowed in respect of a particular item on the basis that
they were incurred unreasonably, which was a high hurdle to surmount. In addition,
the Greffier should resolve any doubts as to the reasonableness of costs in favour of the
trustee.

Where the trustee proposes a course for which it seeks the Court's sanction (an In re S Settlement category 2 case), rather than surrenders its discretion, the trustee is not to be treated
for the purposes of taxation of costs as not assuming a neutral role so as to come within
the above guidelines. A trustee who has taken a position but still seeks the Court's blessing
comes within (5) above.

i. Basis of the Taxation of Costs in Article 51 Applications

Having set out the circumstances in which a trustee, and in some instances the beneficiaries,
are likely to be able to obtain their costs from the trust fund, what follows is a discussion of
the basis upon which such recovery is permitted.
a. Trustees' Costs

3-80

A beneficiary has no right to seek the taxation of a neutral trustee's costs and expenses if
they are not agreed; they may, however, challenge the costs on the more limited grounds
that they were unreasonably incurred or unreasonable in amount.223 On a taxation of a
trustee's costs and expenses ordered under the Royal Court's inherent jurisdiction and RCR
12/3(1)(b) the Greffier will not apply the indemnity basis under RCR.12/5. That procedure
was specifically designed for taxation of awards of costs in hostile litigation. Nor will the

Greffier apply the Factor 'A' and Factor 'B'224 rates.225 Most (if not all) of the detailed provisions of Part 12 of the RCR are therefore inapplicable, as they applied between a paying and
a receiving party rather than to a neutral trustee although the Greffier could apply aspects
of Part 12 in appropriate cases. The guidance provided to the Greffier in the taxation of
trustee's costs is as follows:226
1.

the scales applicable on a normal taxation of costs were not relevant to a taxation of
a neutral trustee's entitlement to recover his costs and expenses from the trust fund;
a trustee's duty included an obligation to consider whether the charges of a particular

b. Beneficiaries' Costs
Where costs of beneficiaries are ordered to be paid out of the trust under a pre-emptive
costs order by analogy with the trustee's right of indemnity from the fund, the beneficiary
is usually afforded the same treatment for taxation purposes as the trustee and costs will
not be taxed on the usual standard or indemnity basis.227 There has been a trend towards
directing taxation of beneficiaries' costs payable out of the fund in non-hostile litigation
on the indemnity basis, especially in cases involving minor or representative beneficiaries.

is derived from Article 47 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. The Royal Court's jurisdiction to
vary a trust can only be exercised over a trust that has Jersey as its proper law.229
47 Variation of terms of a Jersey trust by the court and approval of particular transactions
(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the court may, if it thinks fit, by order approve on behalf of -
a minor or interdict230 having, directly or indirectly, an interest, whether vested or contingent,
under the trust;
(b) any person, whether ascertained or not, who may become entitled, directly or indirectly, to
an interest under the trust as being at a future date or on the happening of a future event a
person of any specified description or a member of any specified class of persons;
(c) any person unborn; or
(d) any person in respect of any interest of his or hers that may arise by reason of any discretionary power given to anyone on the failure or determination of any existing interest that has
not failed or determined,
(a)

any arrangement, by whomsoever proposed and whether or not there is any other person
beneficially interested who is capable of assenting thereto, varying or revoking all or any of
the terms of the trust or enlarging the powers of the trustee of managing or administering
any of the trust property.
(2) The court shall not approve an arrangement on behalf of any person coming within paragraph
(1)(a), (b) or (c) unless the carrying out thereof appears to be for the benefit of that person.
(3) Where in the management or administration of a trust, any sale, lease, pledge, charge, surrender, release or other disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure or other
transaction is in the opinion of the court expedient but the same cannot be effected by reason of
the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustee by the terms of the trust or by law
the court may confer upon the trustee either generally or in any particular circumstances a power
for that purpose on such terms and subject to such provisions and conditions, if any, as the court
thinks fit and may direct in what manner and from what property any money authorized to be
expended and the costs of any transaction are to be paid or borne.
(4) An application to the court under this Article may be made by any person referred to in Article
51(3).

3-83

Article 47(1)-(2) is in similar, although not identical, terms to section 1 of the Variation
of Trusts Act 1958. In construing the article, regard may be had to English authorities
although they must be considered in their relevant context to discern whether the differences between the Jersey and UK provisions are so significant as to make the English cases
inapplicable in Jersey.

229 Trust (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 6. As to the Royal Court's willingness to accept a variation or give effect to a
variation of a Jersey trust by a foreign court, see Ch 15.
230 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 1(1): a person, other than a minor, who under the law of Jersey or under the
law of their domicile, is legally incapable of managing and administering his or her own property and affairs by
reason of mental disorder or of addiction.

Variation of Trusts

161

A. An Arrangement
The statutory definition of arrangement that is capable of approval under Article 47 is
extremely wide. 'Arrangement' encompasses any proposal to vary or revoke any of the trusts
and need not necessarily be in the nature of a contract between the parties (and cannot be
so in the case of a single beneficiary or a proposal on behalf of beneficiaries incapable at law
of contracting with one another).231 In Mubarik v Mubarak,232 it was said that Article 47
empowers the Court to approve an arrangement that might be so extensive as to leave little
of the existing trust's provisions extant.

3-84

i. The Classes of Persons on whose Behalf the Court May Approve an Arrangement
Article 47 does not confer power on the Royal Court to approve an arrangement varying the terms of a trust at its own discretion. The arrangement may only be approved by
the Court on behalf of the persons listed in Article 47(1)(a)-(d). The Court may not, for
example, approve an arrangement to vary a trust on behalf of a capable, ascertained, adult
beneficiary.233

3-85

a. Article 47(1)(a): Minors and Interdicts
A minor234 or an interdict (an adult who lacks capacity),235 whether their interest in the
trust is vested or contingent, will fall within Article 47(1)(a). The paragraph also applies
where trust capital is held on bare trust absolutely for a minor and would be capable of
being called for, but for the fact that the beneficiary is a minor. A minor or interdict beneficiary who is a discretionary beneficiary has a sufficient interest within Article 47(1)(a) to
permit the Court to consent to any variation to the terms of the trust on his or her behalf.
A court-appointed curator has the power to do or arrange for all such things to be done in
relation to the property and affairs of the interdict as appear to the curator to be necessary
or expedient for the maintenance of the interdict.236 However, a curator must apply to the
Court for leave before he may conduct or participate in legal proceedings in the name of the
interdict which includes proceedings to vary a trust of which an interdict is a beneficiary.237
The appointment of a curator and any decision on whether it is appropriate for the curator,
on behalf of the interdict, to propose or participate in an application to vary a trust are dealt
with in a discrete hearing from the hearing to vary the trust. Unlike England and Wales,

[2008 JLR 403].
233 Although where all the beneficiaries are sui juris they may collectively put an end to or vary the trust under
the principle in Saunders v Vautier (1841) EWHC Ch J8; see Re Osias Trusts (n 232) at 402. The States of Jersey
has consulted on a seventh amendment to the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 which would extend Art 47 to empower
the Court to vary a trust regardless of whether that variation is supported or opposed by any one or more of the
adult beneficiaries.
234 A person who attains majority in their country of domicile but who would still be a minor in Jersey is still a
minor for the purposes of Art 47(1)(a); see In Re N [1999 JLR 86].

232

Applications for Directions

Jersey does not have a separate Court of Protection to determine whether the proposed
variation is for the beneficiary lacking capacity's benefit. The costs of the application to the
Royal Court to sanction the curator's participation in the hearing can be ordered to be paid
out of the trust fund at the subsequent hearing. Where the trust might otherwise be varied
out of court under the rule in Saunders v Vautier,238 but for a single adult beneficiary without capacity, the interdict's curator may apply to the Royal Court under Article 43(17)(d)
of the Mental Health (Jersey) Law 1969 for authorisation to exercise a power to consent to
the proposed variation vested in the interdict. This procedure is likely to be cheaper than
proceedings to vary the trust under Article 47 because it does not require the convening of
all the other parties in order for the Court to make a decision on the arrangement.239

Foreign Powers of Attorney
3-87

Jersey law does not have an equivalent of a lasting power of attorney that could in England and Wales be granted under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and so any Jersey power of
attorney (that is not an irrevocable security power of attorney)240 will lapse automatically
upon the supervening incapacity of the donor. Nevertheless, where a person not resident
in Jersey has given a lasting power of attorney in compliance with the United Kingdom legislation and that power has been registered by the Office of the Public Guardian or Court
of Protection in England, it is the practice of the Royal Court to order the registration of
such power with the Judicial Greffe in Jersey, notwithstanding the supervening incapacity
of the donor. This practice is founded on the principle of comity and enables an attorney
to act in relation to assets of the donor situate in the island. The authority conferred by a
foreign lasting power of attorney is likely to be wide enough to cover an assent to the variation of a trust entirely out of court in accordance with the principle in Saunders v Vautier.
However, an out of court variation may not be desirable where the consent of the attorney
to the proposed arrangement is vitiated by a conflict of interest,241 such as the attorney
also being a beneficiary of the same trust. In complex cases, reliance solely on the power of
attorney may be unsafe and the attorney may wish the protection of a court order even if
the assent to the proposed variation appears to fall within the scope of the powers vested in
the attorney. In such circumstances the appropriate way to proceed is by way of an application under the Mental Health (Jersey) Law 1969, notwithstanding that the attorney is not a
court-appointed Jersey curator of the interdict's affairs.

Indirect Interests of Minors and Interdicts
3-88

An indirect interest includes an interest derived under a sub-trust, the trustee of which is
one of the beneficiaries of the head-settlement. Where the head-settlement is proposed to
be varied, the trustee of the sub-settlement will have to consult the terms of the sub-trust
238

(1841) EWHC Ch J82, approved in In re Turino Consolidated Ltd Retirement Trust (n 217).
See Ch 1 and below for the procedural requirements for convening parties to a Representation.
240 A specialised form of power of attorney under Powers of Attorney (Jersey) Law 1995 expressed to be irrevocable and is given either (1) for the purpose of facilitating the exercise of powers of a secured party under the
Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 or of powers given pursuant to a security agreement, or (2) pursuant to or in
connection with or for the purpose of or ancillary to security governed by foreign law.

Variation of Trusts

as to whether it has adequate powers to approve the variation on behalf of its beneficiaries.
Where it has adequate powers but the variation is so momentous as to put the trustee at
risk of personal liability, were it to approve it, an application under Article 51 of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 for directions may be necessary. Where the sub-trustee has insufficient
powers to approve the variation, recourse may be made to Article 47(3) of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984. Alternatively, the Court may approve the variation to the head-trust on
behalf of the sub-trust's beneficiaries, if it is for their benefit under Article 47(1)-(2) and
they fall within the categories of persons on whose behalf the Court can consent.
b. Article 47(1)(b): Unascertained Persons and Persons who May Become Entitled to an
Interest
An identifiable person who already has a vested interest or a contingent interest under the
trust is outside the scope of Article 47(1)(b). Article 47(1)(b) is directed primarily at prospective beneficiaries, that is to say trusts in favour of persons who will at a future date or
on the happening of a future event satisfy a particular description or come to fall within
a particular class so as to acquire an interest under the trust. A prospective beneficiary
under such a trust has a hope of an interest but not an interest in a technical sense. Unlike
the equivalent provision in the 1958 Act,242 Article 47(1)(b) does not contain a proviso
that excludes the Court from giving consent on behalf of any person who would satisfy a
description or fall within a class if it were assumed that the date or event had happened on
the date of the application to court. The effect of the omission of the proviso in the Jersey
legislation is to widen considerably the scope of persons on whose behalf the Court can
consent to a variation. The interests of unascertained beneficiaries are to be considered as a
single class rather than a collection of unascertained individuals.243

3-89

c. Article 47(1)(c): Unborn Persons
Article 47(1)(c) speaks for itself, and since it is silent as to the nature of the interest that
an unborn person is required to have in order to come within the Court's jurisdiction, it
must be taken as including those en ventre sa mere and all those future unborn persons, not
yet conceived and therefore unascertained. Unborn children cannot simply be treated as a
single class, united by the single factor that they are all, as yet, unborn. Regard must be had
to the proposed arrangement as it may be that its terms impact different unborn persons
in different ways, eg a variation to the effect that a child born before a certain future date
will obtain a benefit but children born afterwards will not. In those circumstances the two
classes of unborn children require separate consideration by the Court and an arrangement
that does not benefit them both cannot be approved, notwithstanding that it may conceivably benefit other unborn persons.

3-90

d. Article 47(1)(d): Persons whose Interest Arises by Reason of any Discretionary Power
The fourth and final class of persons on whose behalf the Court may assent to a variation
of the terms of a trust are any person or persons in respect of any interest of his or hers

243

that may arise by reason of any discretionary power given to anyone on the failure or determination of any existing interest that has not failed or determined. Jersey does not have a
statutory basis for protective trusts akin to that in section 33(1)(i) and (ii) of the Trustee Act
1925, which perhaps accounts for this rather inelegantly worded paragraph. In the authors'
view, the provision covers the same ground as the parallel provision in section 1(1)(d) of
the Variation of Trusts Act 1958. This category of beneficiary is anomalous in that the proviso in Article 47(2) does not apply so that the Court can approve a variation that is not for
the benefit of a person falling within Article 47(1)(d).

B. Scope of the Court's Powers to Vary
3-92

3-93

Article 47 empowers the Court to vary or revoke all or any of the terms of a trust, including terms that had arisen from an irrevocable exercise of power by the trustee.244 However,
a trustee who applied for the revocation of a trust provision that had arisen as a result of
an irrevocable exercise of power by him should expect to have the motivation for such a
request very closely examined by the Court.245 The Court cannot approve a variation that is
objected to by a beneficiary with an interest in the arrangement on whose behalf the Court
cannot give its consent. It has been held that an object of a fiduciary power may also block a
proposed arrangement but only if (1) they are a single, adult beneficiary or (2) a restricted
class of beneficiaries who all object to the arrangement.246 While the jurisdiction of the
Court under Article 47 is confined to trusts that have Jersey as their proper law, the Court
is able to approve an arrangement to the effect of a complete revocation of a Jersey law
trust and the transfer of the trust assets to trustees of a trust governed by a foreign law.247
Technically speaking, the power conferred by Article 47(1) is that the trust may be varied
or revoked wholly or partly. There is no power to approve a complete resettlement of the
trust property and the terms of the relief sought should not use the word 'resettle'. That said,
there is very little practical difference between a re-settlement and a revocation of the existing trusts and substitution with new trusts; the test is whether in substance the substitution
is a variation rather than a resettlement.248 If a substantial foreign connection is established,
and the Court is satisfied that the trusts will be enforceable under the law of the place to
which the transfer is made and that the new trustees have suitable experience of administering trusts, the Court is normally prepared to sanction a transfer which is beneficial to the
beneficiaries for whom it is made, whether the transfer is made for fiscal or other reasons.
It seems that Jersey does not adhere to the principle that continues to prevail in English
law, which provides that if the substratum of the trust is sought to be varied, which is to
say that if the purpose of that trust changes by reason of the proposed variation, the Court
has no power to effect the variation under the statutory jurisdiction. In Osias Trusts,249 the

Court identified both the practical difficulty of being able to identify when the substratum
had been altered but also a difficulty of principle in that the Court's jurisdiction to approve
a variation on behalf of those in Article 47(1)(a)-(d) is co-extensive with the doctrine in
Saunders v Vautier; there was no reason why the Court could not approve a variation that
changed the substratum, if that could otherwise be achieved if all the beneficiaries were sui
juris. However in Mubarik v Mubarak,250 the Court of Appeal expressed its reservation as to
whether, if the trust is not to come to an end, the assets must remain dedicated to at least
some, if not all of the trust purposes so as the beneficiaries could still call on the Court for
protection.
The Court will not approve a proposed variation that is contrary to public policy.251 It is no
objection to an arrangement on grounds of public policy that its purpose is to mitigate or
avoid tax provided that the tax avoidance is of benefit.252 The Court will likewise withhold
its approval of an arrangement if one of its terms is or may amount to a fraud on a power.253
There was a fraud where part of the appointor's motive was to enable the approval of a settlement which was more favourable to him than it would otherwise have been.254

3-94

C. Varying Trustees' Powers
Article 47(1) expressly provides the Court with jurisdiction to enlarge the trustee's powers255 but is silent as to whether the Court has power to restrict them, if to do so would be
of benefit to a person in one or more of the classes set out above. Without express provision
in the trust instrument itself or the assent of all beneficiaries of full age and capacity, the
trustee has no power to release or restrict their own powers. Where there is such a power
in the trust instrument and the exercise of that power would not be an improper exercise,
an application to vary under Article 47 is not required. Where there is no existing power
to restrict or release the trustee's powers but a restriction would be for the benefit of the
beneficiaries the better course is to seek an enlargement of the trustee's powers to release or
restrict under Article 47(3) than under Article 47(1)-(2).

D. Benefit

persons falling within Article 47(1)(a)-(c), on whose behalf the Court gives its consent.256
The Court has no power to approve an arrangement that benefits any other person.257 The
Court is not concerned with the wisdom or fairness of the proposed arrangement from the
perspective of the party proposing it258 or from the perspective of any person who is of full
age and capacity and is therefore capable of assenting for themselves.259 The Court will consider the total amount of benefit or advantage that the proposal has for each of the parties
affected by the application. Article 47 does not require that in every possible circumstance,
there will be a benefit to each person or category of persons on whose behalf the Court is
able to consent to the arrangement. The Court is prepared to take a risk in approving an
arrangement if a prudent adult motivated by self-interest and considering the potential risk
would take the same risk.260 An arrangement can therefore still be approved even if eventually no benefit or even a loss befalls those persons as a result of the arrangement.261 What is
and what is not an arrangement of sufficient benefit to the beneficiaries unable to consent is
highly case specific but the following guidance can be gleaned from the reported cases. Benefit is to be widely construed and is not confined to financial advantage to the beneficiaries
for whom the Court is consenting, although in most cases a financial or fiscal advantage will
be the relevant benefit, however a financial benefit will not automatically be sufficient.262
Benefit may include a wider interest in maintaining assets for a whole family, the avoidance
of conflict within a family or the reduction, avoidance, minimisation or deferral of the
trust's tax liabilities as a whole.263 Benefit and drawbacks of a non-financial character as a
result of the arrangement will be relevant for the Court's consideration. Benefit may include
the discharge of a moral obligation, for example towards dependants.264 A moral obligation may be inferred to extend to minors and unborn beneficiaries if it is unanimously
accepted by the adult beneficiaries.265 There is no moral obligation to vary a trust to revoke
an exclusion of the settlor from benefit where the settlor was not in need.266 It has been
held to be of benefit to children that they should be settled in life before they begin receiving an income sufficient to make them independent of the need to work.267 That kind of
consideration may justify an arrangement that postpones vesting; where there would also
be a serious tax disadvantage to a beneficiary in vesting at all, the Court may be persuaded
to go further so as to replace an absolute interest with a discretionary trust.268 Educational
and social considerations can outweigh financial considerations, especially where the latter
are slight, and may be decisive in whether the arrangement is approved or not.269 Provided

the arrangement is of some benefit, however slight, the Court has jurisdiction to approve
it. However, it has a discretion and is not bound to do so.270 The Court will look at the
proposed arrangement as a whole in light of the apparent purpose of the trust.271 For the
arrangement to come within the Court's jurisdiction for approval, there must be a benefit
capable of accruing to each actual or potential beneficiary on whose behalf the Court can
give consent. That principle is not in conflict with the Court's willingness in some cases
to take a risk in approving the arrangement on that person's behalf. The distinction is
said to be between the differing personal characteristics of a possible beneficiary and the
surrounding circumstances which may or may not affect him.272

E. Variation in the Context of Matrimonial Proceedings
The power of the English courts to order a variation to a Jersey trust is well known.273
Section 24(1)(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 has been interpreted very widely and
the English court may vary the interests of the spouses and others under the trust including extinguishing an interest of either spouse. The Court may also order the removal of the
trustees.274 Article 9(4) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 shields a trust (whose governing law
is that of Jersey) from enforcement in Jersey of an order under section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 the effect of which is to vary the terms of a trust, if such enforcement
would be inconsistent with Jersey law.275 Notwithstanding Article 9(4), if the trustee is personally subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts or the interests of the beneficiaries
are otherwise at risk, it had been the practice that trustees were practically compelled
to apply to the Royal Court to seek directions as to whether they could give effect to an
order made against the trust.276 Such applications were made under Article 51(1) and not
Article 47(1), notwithstanding that in effect the trustee was seeking the Court's approval of
a variation in the manner in which the trust was administered without resorting to a formal
express amendment to the terms of the trust that would otherwise fall within Article 47(1).
Since the enactment of the current version of Article 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
there is an unsatisfactory lacuna as to what should happen in circumstances where there
is a foreign court order varying a Jersey trust to which the beneficiaries of the trust do not
consent (the solution in Mubarik). Subject to any amendment to the 1984 Law to allow the
Royal Court to effect a variation over the heads of the adult beneficiaries, the Royal Court
currently has no power either to make the variation itself or to direct the trustee to act in
accordance with the foreign order.

F. The Trustee's Role in an Application for Variation of a Trust
3-98

The Court will have regard to the views of the trustee in relation to matters relevant to
the exercise of the Court's discretion.277 The trustee is expected to act as a watchdog for
those who are not parties to the proceedings such as unascertained beneficiaries within
Article 47(1)(b), unborn persons within Article 47(1)(c) and discretionary beneficiaries
under Article 47(1)(d). Where the proposed arrangement confers discretion on the trustees
the Court may have regard to how the trustees may purport to exercise it.278 The Court may
also seek an indication from the trustee as to how it would exercise an existing discretion
if there were no variation in order to determine the prospective benefit of the proposed
arrangement. A guardian ad litem and curator (or attorney) has a similar function and is
under a duty to inform himself of the minor's or interdict's existing interest, the nature of
the application for approval of the arrangement and to instruct his legal team as he thinks
best.279 The trustee's role is not to represent the interests of adult beneficiaries, who are
capable of taking their own view as to the proposed arrangement, nor is it to represent the
wishes or purported wishes of the settlor or testator (unless that is a matter relevant to the
Court's discretion).280 The trustees should not usually issue the proceedings for approval of
a variation. If, and only if, they are satisfied that the proposals are beneficial to the persons
interested and have a good prospect of being approved by the Court and, crucially, that if
they do not make the application, no one else will, then it may be proper for the trustees
to commence the proceedings.281 Where there is a doubt (and there will often be a doubt)
the trustee should combine the Article 51 and Article 47 proceedings together, first seeking
directions whether to propose the variation (which is likely to be a momentous decision
or a surrender of discretion case) before then proceeding to an application to vary if so
directed.282

G. The Effect of an Order Varying the Trust
3-99

Article 47 merely authorises the Court to approve an arrangement on behalf of those who
cannot themselves consent. If the other beneficiaries (of full age and capacity) have assented
to the arrangement as well then the approval of all interested parties has been obtained, the
trust will be varied or revoked in much the same way as it might have been under the rule in
Saunders v Vautier, had all the beneficiaries been able to consent to the variation. The view
that the court order does not in fact vary the trusts when making its order but only makes
good a want of capacity to consent on the part of some of the beneficiaries has the support
of House of Lords authority.283 The significance of the Court's role in varying the trust is
that in some jurisdictions (notably England and Wales)284 certain written formalities must

be adhered to in order to effect a disposition of an equitable interest (which may in some
cases, particularly in a matrimonial context, be what the variation amounts to).

H. Article 47(3): Power of Court to Vary Administrative Powers
Article 47(3) is the Jersey equivalent of section 57(1) of the Trustee Act 1925 and is a very
different type of application to vary the terms of a trust than the jurisdiction under Article
47(1). Before considering an application under Article 47(3) regard should first be had to
the terms of the trust instrument. Article 24(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides, in
similar terms to the Trustee Act 2000, that subject to the terms of the trust and the trustee's
duties in law (eg the prohibition on a trustee from self-dealing in the trust property), a
trustee shall have all the same powers as a natural person acting as the beneficial owner in
relation to the trust property. While the default position at law will render any question of
expanding the trustee's powers when the trust instrument is silent on that matter moot, the
jurisdiction under Article 47(3) will still be relevant for those trusts that maintain restrictions on the powers of the trustee to administer and invest the trust property. The object
at which Article 47(3) is directed is to secure that the trust property is administered and
managed as advantageously as possible in the interests of the beneficiaries. Note that the
Court has no power to order the termination or winding up of a trust under this provision. Neither does the Court have power to approve an extension of the trustee's powers of
management or administration that could be effected without the Court's intervention.285
There are three issues:
1.

3-100

The scope of the jurisdiction to authorise an enlargement or conferral of investment
and other administrative powers on the trustee.
The circumstances in it which it will be proper for the Court to accede to applications
of this character.
Whether the application should be made under Article 47(3) or Article 47(1).

2.
3.

As regards the first issue, Article 47(3) largely speaks for itself, the Court has jurisdiction
to extend or confer a power of investment or other similar administrative power, including an administrative power of delegation where such a power is expressly excluded from
the terms of the trust.286 In considering what extended powers of investment should be
conferred the Court must consider any discernible underlying purpose to the trust, the
size of the fund, the scope and efficacy of provisions for seeking professional advice and
the ability of the trustees to control the delegation of investment decisions. As regards the
second issue, the Court will exercise the jurisdiction if, having regard to contemporary evidence of investment practice, it is satisfied that the powers available to the trustee under
the trust instrument are insufficient. It is reasonable to expect that, in view of the general

285

eg by an existing power of amendment to the trust instrument.
Anker-Petersen v Anker-Petersen (1998) 12 TruLI 166 (6 December, 1990); for earlier (conflicting) authority
and dicta, see Re Brassey's Settlement [1955] 1 WLR 192 at 196 (jurisdiction exercised but no report on availability
of jurisdiction). Note that Art 25 of the Trusts (Jersey Law) 1984 is in similar terms to Art 24 and provides that
subject to the terms of the trust, a trustee may delegate the execution or exercise of any of his or her trusts or
powers (both administrative and dispositive).
286

Applications for Directions

extension of investment powers effected by the Article 24(1), the Court will only be prepared to authorise the extension of trustee investment powers as 'expedient', where those
powers are excluded or unduly restricted by the trust instrument. Needless to say, the Court
should dismiss an application to extend the trustee's powers under Article 47(3) where
there is no pressing need, so as to make it expedient, to do so. As regards the third issue, it
is the better practice for the application to be made under Article 47(3) rather than Article
47(1), if no variation of beneficial interests is being sought, although where an application
is to be made under Article 47(1) in any event it is likely to be desirable to roll the two applications into a single set of proceedings. Where only an extension of the trustee's powers is
sought, in contrast to applications to vary the terms of a trust, which the trustee should not
generally make without directions, the trustee is the natural person to make the application under Article 47(3). Further, an Article 47(3) application does not require the trustee
to obtain the consent of every adult beneficiary; and the application does not require the
Court to give consent on behalf of every category of beneficiary separately. Under Article
47(3) the proposed extension or transaction must be for the benefit of the trust as a whole
and not for the benefit or one beneficiary (or indeed the trustee).287 An application under
Article 47(3) is therefore a far less costly application because it does not put the legitimate
interests of the beneficiaries in peril.

I. Procedure for Applications to Vary
3-102

Proceedings to vary the terms of a trust either under Article 47(1) or 47(3) should be commenced by Representation.288 The wording in Article 47(1) 'by whom so ever proposed'
indicates that any person may be the representor, even a person who has no interest under
the terms of the trust.289 Prima facie then, Article 47(3), providing that any of the persons
in Article 51(3) may apply for an order to approve a variation, would appear somewhat
unnecessary. The provisions, when read together, must be taken to mean that Article 47(3)
is intended to be read as non-exhaustive and indicative only of the persons who can make
the proposal. A representor who is not the Attorney General, a trustee, an enforcer or a beneficiary can only make an application to vary the trust with the Court's leave.

i. Parties to Be Joined and Who Need Not Be Joined
3-103

All the trustees must be convened as parties. The trustees' role is acutely important where
approval is sought on behalf of persons falling within Article 47(1)(b)-(d) as the trustees are normally expected to represent the interests of those persons. While strictly
speaking adult beneficiaries for whom the Court cannot give its consent do not need to
be made parties (as they can consent out of court), in practice all ascertained living persons, whether or not the Court is assenting to the arrangement on their behalf, who are
directly or potentially interested in the variation, should be convened.290 This practice has

developed as a matter of convenience so that if there is an alteration to the terms of the
proposed arrangement while the arrangement is before the Court and to which they have
already consented, their interests in that alteration can be represented.291
The following may, but need not be convened as parties:292
1.

3-104

beneficiaries whose interests are not in any way affected by the proposed variation, for
instance a life tenant in a case where only the reversionary interests are to be varied;
persons who could take only under a power of appointment whether or not released293
but who have no interest in default of the power of appointment being exercised;294
persons with discretionary interests under a so-called 'protective trust';295 and
persons who may become entitled to an interest in the future under Article 47(1)(b).296

2.
3.
4.

ii. Representation Orders
Unlike in proceedings for directions under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, representation orders are usually inappropriate in the context of an application to vary the
terms of a trust. All minor and interdict beneficiaries on whose behalf the Court's approval
is sought under Article 47(1)(a) should be joined as parties, by their respective guardians
ad litem and curators. The Court does have jurisdiction to approve a variation on behalf of
absent minor beneficiaries297 and in exceptional circumstances will exercise that jurisdiction, for example, where there is a large class of minor beneficiaries with remote interests,
at least one of whom is a party and represented.298 Unborn persons do not yet exist and
therefore cannot be parties and those coming within Article 47(1)(b) and (d) are not normally parties either and are usually represented by the trustee. Where there are two or more
groups of unborn beneficiaries with opposing interest (eg where the variation affects them
in different ways) the trustee cannot represent them both effectively. The correct procedure
in such a case is for the interests of separate classes of unborn beneficiaries to be looked
after by a suitable adult beneficiary or a guardian ad litem of a minor beneficiary in a quasirepresentative role.

3-105

iii. Separate Representation
The trustee and every beneficiary or class of beneficiaries made a party must be separately
and exclusively represented. Persons of full age and capacity (if they wish to be represented
in their own right) should be represented by their own counsel and not by the same counsel

The costs of adult beneficiaries of full capacity are usually allowed out of the trust fund.

as those on whose behalf the Court's approval is being sought.299 Unlike in the UK,300 where
the usual practice is for parties sui juris to be separately represented by their own counsel
from those who are not sui juris even where the same firm of solicitors can act for all with
appropriate safeguards, owing to the fused nature of Jersey's legal profession, it is not usually appropriate for the same firm of advocates to act on behalf of all the parties.

iv. Representor's Evidence
3-107

The prayer for relief should normally seek an order under Article 47(1) of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 approving on behalf of the beneficiaries, for whom the Court's approval
is sought, an arrangement varying (or revoking as appropriate) the trusts in the terms of
the draft instrument arrangement (which should appear as a schedule to the affidavit filed
in support of the action), subject to such modifications as the Court may approve. The
Representation should state the legal basis for the order sought, that the relief sought comes
within the jurisdiction conferred by Article 47, that the relief sought is for the benefit of
the beneficiaries concerned (referring to the affidavit as to which beneficiaries and how the
arrangement benefits them) and is otherwise fit for approval on their behalf. The supporting affidavit should contain the bulk of the case in support of the claim and the terms of
the proposed order approving the arrangement. It is suggested the affidavit should cover
the following matters:
1.
2.

The present constitution of the trust, exhibiting copies of the relevant trust documents.
Material information in relation to the assets subject to the trust and their value and
income yield. Where a material issue turns on the precise value of the trust assets,
this evidence should be supported by an up-to-date professional valuation although as
with medical evidence, it is usually unnecessary for this evidence to be supported by an
affidavit from the valuers. Where the trust fund comprises of shares in private companies, it may be useful to exhibit recent company accounts, together with other material
information relating to the companies concerned. It is not normally necessary for the
trust accounts to be included in the evidence.
Material information in relation to the beneficiaries, normally stating the date of birth
of minor beneficiaries and, where material, the age of adult beneficiaries. If anything
turns on the health of particular beneficiaries (to include mental health where a curator may need to be appointed) or their ability to have children,301 the evidence should
cover such matters, and a medical certificate should be exhibited,302 although it is normally unnecessary for any such medical evidence to be supported by an affidavit from
the doctor from whom it is obtained.
Where the benefit of the proposed variation is a mitigation or saving of tax, the
evidence must include the computation showing how the tax saving is to be achieved
and the quantum of the saving to be expected. This may involve evidence as to the
assets comprised in the patrimony of the beneficiaries where that affects tax rates

Variation of Trusts

applicable to trust assets or their income. Where the benefit, or a benefit, of the proposed variation involves provision from sources other than the trust fund itself, the evidence should cover the availability of such provision and its value. Actuarial evidence
consisting of instructions to the actuary, and his opinion, should be exhibited where,
in order to assess the benefit of an arrangement, it is necessary to value the interests
of the beneficiaries. It will not normally be necessary for this actuarial evidence to be
supported by an affidavit from the actuary.
Unless the reasons are self-evident, the affidavit should state the reasons why the
representor(s) desire the proposed variation.
Where a personal covenant is to be given, there should be evidence of the financial
position of the covenantor.303

The Representation and affidavit should be deposited with the Judicial Greffe in accordance

should seek the Court's directions as to the convening of parties, service of the proceedings
(whether within or without the jurisdiction) and supporting material upon them, the filing
of responses and such other case management directions as the Court considers appropriate. A guardian ad litem and curator must be appointed for parties who are minors or
interdicts; where this has not already been done the directions sought at the first hearing
may include orders for the appointment of such officers.

3-108

v. Responses and Evidence
Applications under Article 47 are rarely opposed as a considerable amount of front-loading
is required in preparation before the proceedings are issued. The adult beneficiaries convened as respondents will not normally file evidence. If the adult beneficiaries have anything to say in the proceedings that is not a consent to the proposed arrangement then the
Court has no jurisdiction to make the variation.
Any guardians ad litem and curators should file evidence to the effect that they support
the proposed variation as being in the interests of the children and unborn beneficiaries. Unless the Court orders otherwise their evidence must be accompanied by a written
opinion to this effect by the advocate who will appear on the hearing of the application.304
In line with the English practice, it is not thought that there is a requirement for a written
opinion in respect of interests under Article 47(1)(d).305 It is, however, for the Royal Court,
not the guardian ad litem, curator or the trustees, to determine whether a proposed variation is beneficial to the minor or unborn beneficiaries concerned, and an objection from a
litigation friend or the trustees on behalf of a minor or unborn beneficiary cannot preclude
the jurisdiction. Where the interests of two or more minor beneficiaries, or two or more of
the minor beneficiaries and unborn beneficiaries, are similar, only a single written opinion
needs to be filed, notwithstanding the usual practice is that the trustees concerned on behalf

of unborn beneficiaries will normally be represented in court by a different advocate from
the advocate or advocates representing the minors.

vi. Hearing
The substantive hearing is before the Inferior Number. The substantive hearing before
the Court will normally be in private or at the very least the identities of the parties
anonymised.306As proceedings under Article 47 only arise for want of an inability of minors,
unborns and unascertained beneficiaries to consent to an arrangement, the proceedings are
not to be regarded as hostile or adversarial for the purposes of the usual rule that proceedings before the Royal Court should ordinarily be in public.

vii. The Act of Court
3-111

We consider it unlikely that the Court has jurisdiction under Article 47(1) to order that
the proposed arrangement or transaction, once approved, should be carried into effect.307
The usual order is that the Court approves the arrangement.308 If an extension to the trustee's administrative or investment powers is approved, such approval will have the effect of
amending the terms of the trust from the date of the order. The Court can rescind or vary
an order under Article 47(1) or (3) or make any new or further orders.309

viii. Costs
3-112

The proposed order for costs will normally be agreed between the parties in advance of the
hearing and the Court will normally give effect to the proposed order. Where it is proposed
that costs should, either in whole or in part, be paid out of the trust fund in which minor,
unborn or unascertained beneficiaries are interested that will be a factor to be taken into
account in determining whether the proposed variation is beneficial to those beneficiaries.
However, if it is proposed that costs should be paid out of the fund in which minor, unborn
or unascertained beneficiaries are to be interested under the variation, the judge should
either order the costs concerned to be taxed summarily, or order a detailed taxation of costs
unless the costs are agreed or approved on some basis. The Court might be prepared to
dispense with a detailed taxation, if it can be satisfied that the non-adult beneficiaries will
be adequately protected without it, for example where there are adults (whether trustees
or beneficiaries) who might be expected to scrutinise costs of other parties properly. The

306 As to private hearings see below. Private hearings can be justified only on the basis that they involve confidential information, or are necessary to protect the interests of a child, or perhaps on the basis that they involve
matters arising in the administration of a trust. A contentious issue of fact or law would provide a reason for the
giving of a public judgment with suitable anonymisation, as would the absence of any real prejudice to the protection of confidential information or the interests of a child.

parties should be prepared to file schedules of costs in case the Court decides to order a
summary taxation. Where an application under Article 47(1) is successfully contested, or
nonetheless fails, the usual principles concerning the costs of proceedings will apply.310 The
unsuccessful representor may be ordered to pay the costs of those successfully resisting the
application, though the Court has discretion to make a different order. Where the application to vary is successful despite opposition, it becomes necessary to consider where in the
structure the opposition comes from. Opposition cannot come from a beneficiary of full
age and capacity.311 If the opposition comes from the guardian of a minor or curator of
an incapable beneficiary, then in principle the guardian or curator may be ordered to pay
costs. However, there is a strong argument to be made that the Court should make a different order if the guardian or curator has been advised not to support the application on the
basis of professional advice that the proposed variation is genuinely believed not to be beneficial to those for whom he is concerned. In those circumstances, even if the Court decides
to override that advice and approve the variation, it would be harsh to deprive a guardian
or curator of his costs, and harsher still to order him to pay the costs of the other parties.
If the opposition comes from the trustees, then they would nonetheless usually be entitled
to their costs on an indemnity basis from the trust fund. But even in assessing their costs
on the full indemnity basis, the trustees might be deprived of costs unreasonably incurred,
for example in the preparation of irrelevant or unnecessary evidence.312 Where the trustees
have been professionally advised to oppose or not support a proposed variation, but the
representor presses ahead, the trustees should consider whether they should seek to protect
their position as to costs by obtaining the directions of the Court under Article 51.

X. Privacy Orders
While Jersey subscribes to the general principal that the proceedings of the Court should
be conducted with members of the public and press permitted to attend,313 it is a common
feature of proceedings under Article 47(1) and Article 51 that hearings are usually ordered
to be heard in private.314 Part of the rationale for public proceedings is to protect litigants
from inappropriate behaviour on the part of the Court, to maintain public confidence in
the impartial administration of justice and make uninformed and inaccurate reporting or
comment on proceedings less likely.315 This is not to say that proceedings conducted in
private are invariably riven with examples of the abuses given above or that such abuses
would not occur if the proceedings were in public. The privacy of hearings for directions
and applications for variation of trusts is often billed as a selling point by those wishing to

310

See Ch 1.
If the proposed variation is dependent on his consent, it cannot succeed if his consent is withheld; and if it
is not so dependent, then his opposition is irrelevant and he should not be a party.

promote the island's fiduciary services industry. Privacy can be attractive both for trustees
and those beneficiaries who perhaps for cultural or other reasons do not wish to be seen to
be washing their linen in public. As has already been stated, an application under Article
47(3) to extend the trustee's powers is a different jurisdictional animal from an application
to vary the beneficial interests under a trust under Article 47(1). In our view, while there
may be commercial sensitivity in a proposed transaction for which the trustee lacks sufficient powers, this is the only conceivable justification for an application under Article 47(3)
to be heard in private. The Court may take other measures, short of ordering the proceedings to be in private, in respect of litigants' privacy, often by anonymising judgments.

A. Principles of Privacy
3-114

3-115

Sitting in private means the Court will exclude all persons from court who are not a party
or the legal representatives of a party. Although proceedings under both Article 47 and
51 are commenced by Representation rather than by way of Order of Justice, the form of
originating process has no bearing on whether the Court will hear the action in private. The
determinative factor is the substance of the proceedings and not their form. The practice
has developed that hearings falling within categories (a), (b) and (c), that is hearings of an
administrative or supervisory character, identified in S Settlement,316 should be heard in
private on the basis that having such applications in public would tend to undermine the
relationship of confidence that lies at the heart of the relationship between the trustee and
its beneficiaries. It follows that proceedings against the trustee for breach of trust should
not be heard in private but in open court.
In Article 47 and Article 51 proceedings, an order that the proceedings be heard in private is
usually sought as an item of relief in the prayer to the Representation presented to the Court
on the first Friday Samedi Division hearing. The Court should not direct the proceedings
to be in private until all the parties have been convened and have had opportunity to make
submissions on the issue of privacy. The burden to obtain a privacy order lies with the party
seeking an order for proceedings to be in private. The threshold that must be satisfied is that
proceeding in private is the only way in which justice can be achieved. The convenience of
the party or parties, potential embarrassment and a party or parties' preference are insufficient justifications to order the proceedings be in private. Al Thani was a case where there
was argument between the parties as to whether proceedings should be in private. Where
it may be convenient for all parties to the litigation that the proceedings are conducted in
private, an order should not be made on the basis that there is no inter partes opposition to
privacy. The burden is not discharged by all parties agreeing that the proceedings should be
in private. The Court should itself be resistant to it, starting from the position that hearings
prima facie should be heard in public and the Court should be addressed at length on the
relevant principles to be applied before making an order. The parties should ensure that the
basis for a privacy order and its scope are clearly recorded as the rationale may be prayed
in aid later when a party may seek to lift the order in respect of certain documents and
materials. Without being able to refer to a clear basis on which a privacy order was made,

316

the Court may be reluctant to vary or lift the order and a party seeking variance will be at a
disadvantage in only being able to make very generalised submissions.

B. Factors to be Considered in Applications for Privacy Orders
Whether to make a privacy order is not a question of the Court's discretion as to what is
expedient or reasonable; the jurisdiction must be exercised on a principled basis.317 The
Court must conduct a balancing exercise, weighing the principle of open justice against the
competing considerations of (1) an individual's right to respect for confidentiality of their
private business and affairs; and (2) the benefit to trustees concerned with the administration of their trusts to seek the Court's guidance in a relatively informal and flexible manner. Clearly within (2) is a desire to ensure Jersey's fiduciary services industry obtains the
assistance it requires so as to ensure Jersey remains an attractive jurisdiction in which to
establish a trust as against rival offshore jurisdictions. That factor was clearly in play in the
Court's assertion in Al Thani that the Jersey Court has accorded a greater importance to
the need to respect the confidentiality of private trusts than has been the case elsewhere.318
The chief object of the Court must be to secure that justice is done.319 That is a serious
qualification to the well-known aphorism that justice should not only be done but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.320 It follows that where privacy is necessary
for justice to be done or that at least without privacy it would be doubtful that justice can
be achieved, the Court has jurisdiction to order the proceeding be conducted in private.
This test is a strict one: the convenience of the parties, the embarrassment of publicity or
simply that no party objects to an order for privacy, are not factors that will weigh in favour
of the Court granting a privacy order.321 Hearings in private are said to contribute to the
administration of justice by allowing issues to be discussed frankly and informally in a way
the parties may not wish to do were the proceedings in open court.322
In an application for directions the trustee is obliged to give full and frank disclosure to
the Court in order for it to determine the question before it. Such disclosure is likely to
include material that is of commercial or legal sensitivity. It must be able to summarise the
arguments for and against the proposed course of action, including any weaknesses or possible risks in relation to what is proposed. That duty of disclosure is not lessened in cases
in which the trustee does not surrender its discretion to the Court. It follows that whether
or not the trustee surrenders its discretion, had it not applied to Court for directions that
material would have remained confidential. The trust should not have material that would
otherwise remain confidential made public simply because the Court, rather than the trustee, is acting qua trustee or because the Court is assisting the trustee with a decision the
trustee has to make.323 The justification for private hearings is not simply on the basis of

the trustee's obligation in order to obtain the protection of a court order. The Court considers that there is a strong policy imperative that trustees should feel able to come before the
Court confident in the knowledge that they may speak frankly to the Court and that what is
said or produced to the Court and to the other parties to the private proceedings will not be
released to third parties or used for purposes other than the private proceedings.324
The Court must have regard to the purpose of its jurisdiction under Article 51 or 47. The
broad purpose of those provisions is to assist trustees to resolve the difficulties of their
office by seeking judicial guidance in an orderly but relatively informal and flexible manner.
Where the Court is sitting and exercising an administrative or quasi-parental jurisdiction
to protect the interests of all the beneficiaries of a trust, the Court should generally sit in
private.325 Hearing proceedings in private engages Article 6(1) of the European Convention
of Human Rights.326 Although it was not the subject of a decision outside Jersey, Jersey's
approach was held compatible with the Convention on the basis that the protection of the
private lives of the parties was sufficient justification, absent any compelling reason to the
contrary, for resolving to sit in private.
Proceedings that are controversial or hotly contested applications which are or have the
character of adversarial proceedings should, prima facie, be conducted in open court.327
However it is a mistake to think that all proceedings commenced under Article 51 or 47 are
harmonious. Some applications for directions may be fiercely contested and have all the
features of hostile litigation that, should in principle, be heard in open court yet remain in
private.328

C. Consequences of Privacy
3-121

3-122

It is a contempt of court for party to a hearing held in private to disclose any material
received by them in the course of the proceedings or to reveal the nature or contents of a
private hearing without the permission of the Court.329 A party who already has material in
their possession, independent of the hearing, is free to use such material provided in doing
so it does not reveal that those documents were used in a private hearing or the contents of
that hearing.330
It remains unclear whether a party to private proceedings is permitted to use material 'in
their mind' acquired by them from participating in the private hearing without the Court's
permission. In our view, having regard to the purpose of a privacy order, provided the
material in a person's mind does not reveal its source or the nature of the private hearing
then no permission is required. However, material whose provenance cannot be disclosed
is likely to be of limited, if any, practical use. Similarly, a party who pleads facts in English
proceedings that are substantiated by documents that cannot be disclosed by reason of a

privacy order leaves itself vulnerable in being unable to fulfil their obligations under the
CPR unless and until the Royal Court grants leave to discharge or vary the privacy order in
respect of the material.331
All the other parties to the proceedings must consent to any variation of a privacy order in
order for any party to use documents subject to such an order outside the private proceedings. Where consent cannot be achieved an application to court for leave to use the documents is required. In the context of directions application (unless the party is already in
possession of the material by some means other than having obtained them in the private
proceedings), it will be a contempt of court for the any party to use documents subject to a
privacy order outside the proceedings without the leave of the court. This is so even where
the party seeking to use the documents is subject to, and wishes to use the documents to
satisfy, an order for disclosure to which they are subject in another jurisdiction.332

3-123

D. Privacy and the Implied Undertaking
There is likely to be a considerable degree of overlap between materials that are subject to a
privacy order and materials that are subject to the implied undertaking.333 It is a contempt
of court for a party who has received material from another party under compulsion to use
or refer to that material in another set of proceedings without the Court's permission.334

3-124

i. Material Protected by the Implied Undertaking
The categories of documents that are usually subject to the implied undertaking are material produced under the compulsion of a court order such as an order for discovery, disclosure pursuant to an injunction or ordered for production under a subpoena duces tecum, or
under the Norwich Pharmacal/Bankers Trust jurisdiction335 or an analogous situation, and
written evidence provided under an order for the filing of affidavits (including accompanying exhibits). It follows that material will not be subject to the implied undertaking (but
when the Court is sitting in private, is still likely to be the subject of a privacy order) where
it has not been produced under compulsion. In the context of an Article 51 application,
the trustee's duty is not limited to documents upon which it intended to rely (the usual
order for discovery) but also to produce material of which the trustee considers that the
Court should be informed under its duty of full and frank disclosure.336 Material produced
in furtherance of the trustee's duty of full and frank disclosure is to be treated as akin to
331 Trilogy Management Limited v YT & Ors [2014] JRC 182. Particular care should be made when referring
to documents in a pleading or affidavit. Under RCR 2004, r 6/17 the Royal Court may order any party to any
proceedings in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document to produce that document for
the inspection of any other party and to permit the other party to take copies; see also CPR 31.14: 'A party may
inspect a document mentioned in-(a) a statement of case; (b) a witness statement; (c) a witness summary; or
(d) an affidavit'.

discovery under compulsion of a court order.337 It is necessary to identify the specific documents which are the subject matter of the application and it is not appropriate, other than
in the simplest cases, to refer to documents as a class or category and further the purpose
to which the documents are to be put must be identified.338 Where the use of documents
subject to the undertaking are sought in order to assist in the recovery process following
trial and determination of the sums due, the Court may take a more flexible approach to
the requirement of particularising specific documents.339 Whether the Court is prepared to
release material subject to the implied undertaking requires the Court to hold the balance
between two competing interests. First, there is an important public interest in protecting
privacy and confidential information so as not to deter litigants from making full and frank
discovery in civil proceedings. Secondly, there are the interests of justice, particularly in
complex international cases, including but not limited to those involving fraud, in enabling
those defrauded to pursue those who have defrauded them in various jurisdictions if necessary.340 Ultimately, in deciding whether to order documents to be released from the implied
undertaking the Court will apply a broad 'interests of justice' test. The Australian case of
Springfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bridgelands Securities Ltd,341 cited with approval before the
Jersey Royal Court in Claes Enhőrning v Nordic Link Limited and Ors,342 considered the following factors will be relevant where the Court is weighing the balance of releasing documents from the undertaking (although not all factors will be of relevance in every case and
they are listed in no particular order of importance):
1.
2.
3.
4.

the nature of the document for which leave is sought;
the circumstances in which it came into existence;
the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain;
whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain;
the nature of the information in the documents (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information);
the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant for
leave;
the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in the proceedings for
which leave is sought; and
whether there is a commonality of facts between the parties.

The requirement for leave at all arises from two competing public policy imperatives. The
undertaking ensures the confidentiality of the party's private documents, and thereby
encourages the full and proper disclosure of documents that the administration of justice
requires.343 The public interest in privacy and confidence demands that the principle of
compulsion is not abused and should not be pressed further than the course of justice

requires. The courts should, therefore, not allow another party, or anyone else, to use the
documents for an ulterior or purpose foreign to the justification for disclosure in the first
action without good reason.344 Where the party who has provided material protected by the
undertaking is able to demonstrate some specific harm in the release of the undertaking the
Court will also consider that in the balance. Often the 'harm' will be expressed as a concern
that where the other court makes an adverse finding on the basis of the documents to be
released, the disclosing party is not given the opportunity of explaining the documents so
as to vindicate itself. That said, it is hard to conceive that the Jersey Court would place much
weight upon what in most cases is bound to be a peripheral finding of fact by a foreign
court in relation to a Jersey trust. Where a finding of fact is not in fact peripheral (foreign
matrimonial proceedings being the clear example) it is open to the party protected by the
implied undertaking to give evidence to the foreign court to explain the documents if to do
so is in the interests of either the trustee or the beneficiaries.345
As well as a power to control what documents are released from the undertaking the Court
can also determine to what use documents may be put once released. It is highly unlikely
the Court will give unlimited use of documents or give leave for the transfer of documents
to a third party wholly outside the proceedings on the footing that the Court would then
have lost control completely of what use is made of the documents.

3-127

E. Privacy and Privilege
It is a peculiar feature of the Court's administrative jurisdiction under Article 51 that privileged material is often disclosed to the Court. The Court is restricted in its ability to be
able to grant leave for the use of documents outside a private hearing that are privileged
in the hands of other parties to the private proceedings. 'Privilege' in this context means
legal professional privilege; that is material protected by legal advice privilege and litigation privilege. Given that the issue of privilege here arises in the context of proceedings
between trustees and beneficiaries, the material may also be subject to common interest or
joint interest privilege. Consideration will need to be given to the following matters in the
following order: (1) whether the material is privileged (2) in whose hands is the material
privileged; (3) whether the use of that material in proceedings brought under Article 47 or
51 has already waived privilege; and (4) if privilege survives in the material, whether the
Court may give leave for a party to private proceedings to use such material outside the
private proceedings.

3-128

i. Whether the Material is Privileged
Legal professional privileged material may be subject to legal advice privilege or litigation
privilege. It is not the function of this text to explore in detail the nature of legal professional privilege.346 Legal advice privilege applies to confidential communications which

pass between a client and his lawyer which have come into existence for the purpose of
giving or receiving legal advice about what should prudently and sensibly be done in the
relevant legal context. If in doubt as to whether the advice was given in a relevant legal
context an objective two-stage test should be applied: (1) does the advice relate to rights,
liabilities, obligations or remedies of the client; and (2) if it does, the advice will be covered
by legal advice privilege provided it falls within the policy underlying the justification for
legal advice privilege in Jersey law. Material provided in the course of an application for
directions under Article 51 or an application to vary the terms of a trust under Article 47
may often include material that is covered by legal advice privilege such as legal advice on
the interpretation of a provision of the trust instrument itself, or the mandatory dividend
provision in the articles of association of an investment company wholly owned by the
trust.347 Legal advice privilege is narrower in ambit than litigation privilege but can be
claimed more commonly. Documents that are privileged under this head are privileged
for all time unless privilege is expressly or impliedly waived or inadvertently lost.348 For
litigation privilege to apply, the material in question must be confidential, be a communication between either the lawyer (acting in a professional capacity) or the client and a third
party, or be a document created by or on behalf of the client or his lawyer, be made for the
dominant purpose of litigation and litigation must be pending, reasonably contemplated or
existing. The burden of proving material is legally professionally privileged is always with
the person asserting the privilege. Legal advice privilege and litigation privilege are distinct
types of legal professional privilege. Legal advice privilege can apply whether or not litigation is pending or contemplated whereas litigation privilege can only apply when litigation
is pending or contemplated. Legal advice privilege only applies to communications between
a lawyer and client whereas litigation privilege can apply to communications by a client or
his lawyer and a third party.
a. Joint and Common Interest Privilege
3-130

Privilege in materials put before the Court in an application for directions or an application
to vary a trust may also be shared between the parties to the proceedings. Such material
may be the subject of joint interest privilege or common interest privilege or the related
concept of common interest privilege.349 Persons with a joint retainer to a firm of solicitors
or Jersey advocates cannot assert privilege against one another for documents generated in
respect of the joint retainer but the waiver of privilege excludes communications after an
actual conflict of interest has arisen.350 This is a joint privilege. Joint interest privilege may
apply where a third party can establish a joint interest in the subject matter of a privileged
communication between a lawyer and a client and that third party is not party to the client/
lawyer relationship.351 Joint privilege gives that third party a right of access to the communication against the client and gives that third party the right to claim privilege against the

rest of the world in respect of that communication. Joint interest privilege has been held to
exist in the relationship between beneficiaries and trustees.352
in order for joint privilege to arise the joint interest must exist at the time that the communication comes into existence. If the parties subsequently fall out and sue one another, neither of them
can claim privilege as against the other in respect of any documents that are caught by the joint
privilege, as the original joint interest is not destroyed by a subsequent disagreement between the
parties.353

Ford v Financial Services Authority354 is the first English authority (there are currently no
Jersey authorities) to establish the specific criteria for making a finding of joint interest
privilege in the absence of a joint retainer, where the parties had a joint interest in the subject matter of the relevant communication when it was made. An individual claiming joint
privilege in these circumstances would need to adduce evidence that: (1) he communicated
with the lawyer for the purpose of seeking advice in an individual capacity; (2) he made
clear to the lawyer that he was seeking legal advice in an individual capacity, rather than
only as a representative; (3) those with whom the joint privilege was claimed knew or ought
to have appreciated the legal position; (4) the lawyer knew or ought to have appreciated that
he was communicating with the individual in that individual capacity; and (5) the communication with the lawyer was confidential. That formulation is not without difficulty. The
principal difficulty is likely to be that if joint privilege exists it cannot be waived without the
consent of all the individuals who satisfy the above checklist. This is a somewhat startling
proposition when the position may have to be determined years after the relevant advice is
given and consent sought from people whose interests by that time may be totally different.
It is important to establish whether it is the privilege that is joint or whether it the interest
(sometimes also known as 'common interest').
There is a privilege which may be called a 'common interest' privilege. That is a privilege in aid
of anticipated litigation in which several persons have a common interest. It often happens in
litigation that a plaintiff or defendant has other persons standing alongside him-who have the
self-same interest as he-and who have consulted lawyers on the self-same points as he-but these
others have not been made parties to the action. Maybe for economy or for simplicity or what you
will. All exchange counsel's opinions. All collect information for the purpose of litigation. All make
copies. All await the outcome with the same anxious anticipation-because it affects each as much
as it does the others. Instances come readily to mind. Owners of adjoining houses complain of a
nuisance which affects them both equally. Both take legal advice. Both exchange relevant documents. But only one is a plaintiff. An author writes a book and gets it published. It is said to contain
a libel or to be an infringement of copyright. Both author and publisher take legal advice. Both
exchange documents. But only one is made a defendant.
In all such cases I think the courts should-for the purposes of discovery-treat all the persons
interested as if they were partners in a single firm or departments in a single company. Each can
avail himself of the privilege in aid of litigation. Each can collect information for the use of his or

the other's legal adviser. Each can hold originals and each make copies. And so forth. All are the
subject of the privilege in aid of anticipated litigation, even though it should transpire that, when
the litigation is afterwards commenced, only one of them is made a party to it. No matter that one
has the originals and the other the copies. All are privileged.355

While a joint privilege cannot be waived as against third parties unilaterally, it is thought the
same difficulty does not arise where it is the interest, rather than the privilege that is joint.356
Joint or common interest privilege has not been well explored in the Jersey courts and the
English law doctrine is currently unclear as to what sort of common interest will suffice for
this type of privilege to apply. It is still uncertain as to whether common interest privilege
will apply in any given situation. Consequently, it is best to be cautious when considering
disclosing privileged documents to third parties. If in doubt, consider disclosure only on
the basis of express contractual undertakings that privilege in the documents is not waived.
Common interest privilege arises where a person voluntarily discloses a privileged document to a third party who has a common interest in the subject matter of the privileged
document or in litigation in connection with which the document was brought into existence.357 It will arise where parties share the same interest in litigation (or potential litigation), or in a commercial transaction to which the legal advice relates. Where common
interest privilege applies, the document remains privileged in the hands of the recipient and
the recipient can assert the disclosing party's privilege as against the world. In The Matter of
the M and Other Trusts identifies the parties to an application under Article 51 as having a
common interest privilege.
Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company & Anor v AG (Manchester) Ltd & Ors358 confirmed
that common interest privilege can be used as a both a 'sword' to obtain disclosure as well as
a 'shield' to prevent disclosure. In other words, if party B has a sufficiently common interest
in communications that are held by party A, then party B can obtain disclosure of those
communications from party A even though as against third parties the communications
would be privileged from production. In the context of the use of privileged materials in
a private hearing common interest privilege as a shield is the focus. For the applicant for
leave, the objective is to resist the suggestion of a common interest privilege in documents
he seeks leave to use. If the privilege in the material survives disclosure into the private
proceedings, the Court cannot grant leave to use the material where those who share
the common interest privilege with the applicant, object to its use outside the private
proceedings.
There is English Court of Appeal authority359 to the effect that a claim for common
interest privilege cannot be maintained where there is a conflict of interest between the
parties sharing the common interest. However, this ignores the possibility that while two
parties may have diametrically opposed interests in one respect their interests may be
aligned in another and the bar on common interest applying to parties in conflict may not

be sacrosanct.360 The categories of relationship capable of giving rise to common interest privilege are not closed. It is significant that any parties who do or might use the same
solicitors will fall within the doctrine361 for the reason that applications under Article 47(1)
to vary the terms of a trust permit, certainly as a matter of English law at least, the use of a
single firm of solicitors to represent all parties.

ii. In whose Hands is the Material Privileged?
In Three Rivers District Council and others v Governor and Co of the Bank of England,362 the
Court of Appeal gave a very restrictive definition of 'client' and held it would only cover
communications between the lawyer and a small group of the bank's employees actually
charged with instructing the Bank's lawyers. This means where the client is a company, you
cannot assume that all documents produced by employees and sent directly to lawyers will
be privileged. Care must be taken to establish in whose hands material may be privileged.
Privilege is a defence to disclosure. It follows that it is not the place of the party seeking leave
to use material subject to a privacy order (or any other party) to identify or assert privilege
in any document if the privilege in that document does not belong to that party. A party
cannot assert a defence that does not belong to it. Privilege may be lost in a number of ways
but can only be waived, expressly or impliedly, by the person who has the benefit of the
privilege; the Court cannot waive privilege in a document.363

3-137

iii. Has the Privilege in Material already been Waived?
Privilege may be lost in several different ways, for example by placing privileged material
before the Court, by the loss of confidentiality in the material or by express waiver364 by
or on the authority of the owner of the privilege. Here we are concerned with whether the
disclosure of material that might otherwise be privileged in a private hearing for directions
or variation of the trust will amount to a waiver of privilege. Confidentiality is a prerequisite of privilege, all privileged documents are confidential, although not all confidential
documents are privileged.365 It has been held that disclosure is not lost by disclosure to the
Court as part of an Article 51 application.366 Nor is it lost by disclosure to persons sharing a
common interest.367 Whether privilege has in fact been waived is a highly fact-specific exercise. It is unclear whether the nature of the Court's jurisdiction, the common interests of
the parties (or a combination of both) is determinative of the question of whether privilege
has been waived. It should not be assumed that just because a Representation under Article
51 proceeds on the footing that the Court is exercising an administrative jurisdiction in

assisting the trustee to make a decision or interpreting a provision, that the interests of all
those convened to the application are aligned. In our view, the principle stated in A, B and C
v Rozel Trustees (Channel Islands) Limited, that disclosure in applications under the Court's
administrative jurisdiction will not waive privilege, is possibly too wide and close regard
should be had to the common interest of the convened parties. Privilege is not lost on the
basis that confidentiality has been destroyed but on a different basis: that no privilege can
attach to communications between parties whose interests are opposed. In Article 51 proceedings, even though the convened parties may disagree as to the proposed course to be
taken by the trustees, they all have a common interest in the resolution of that question. In
an Article 47(1) application, the beneficial interests are sought to be varied, giving rise to
an inherent potential conflict of interest between the beneficiaries whose interests are the
subject of the variation. That conflict is the reason the jurisdiction is so tightly hedged with
the requirements of 'benefit' and separate representation of the convened beneficiaries. As
no privilege can attach to communications between parties whose interests are opposed, it
is the authors' view that privilege will be lost where disclosure of material is made to a party
or parties who do not share a common interest, notwithstanding that there is a privacy
order in effect so as to make the proceedings confidential.

iv. Can the Court Give Leave to Use Privileged Material outside Private Proceedings?
3-139

The Court will not (and arguably cannot) give leave for the use of material subject to a
privacy order that is privileged.368 To do so would cut across the principle that legal advice
privilege is an absolute defence to disclosure.369

F. Seeking Leave to Use Material Subject to a Privacy Order
3-140

3-141

Owing to the common overlap between materials protected by the implied undertaking
and a privacy order, what follows deals with applications for leave which effectively vary or
revoke both, either in whole or in part.
A litigant subject to a privacy order may seek to vary or lift the order in whole or in part
for a number of reasons. One reason may be that during the course of private proceedings,
material may be disclosed or facts may be brought to light that suggests one of the parties
to the litigation may have a claim against a party to the proceedings or a third party outside
the proceedings.370 If that party then seeks to pursue a claim using the material disclosed in
the course of a private hearing he will be in contempt of court, not only for breach of the
privacy order but also for breach of the implied undertaking. A variation to the terms of a
privacy order is sometimes also made in the context of matrimonial proceedings. Where the
trustee seeks directions as to how it should respond to foreign ancillary relief proceedings,
the trust's beneficiaries are very likely to be convened to that application. That directions
hearing will ordinarily be in private. If the beneficiaries are joined to the ancillary relief

Query whether a court that holds the trustee's surrendered discretion is capable of waiving privilege qua
trustee. Where the trustee is entirely deadlocked on all matters, owing to deadlock of the board of directors who
cannot be removed, the Court probably will have jurisdiction to waive privilege on the trustee's behalf.

Privacy Orders

proceedings they may be subject to foreign court orders to disclose material about the trust
from the directions hearing to the English court in order to assist it with its determination
as to whether or not to make an order varying the trust. There are two issues for a party
seeking to vary a privacy order: the first is with regard to the implied undertaking,371 the
second with regard to the privacy order.

i. Procedure
It is open to the parties to agree to the use of materials that would otherwise be subject to
the implied undertaking or the privacy order, out of court. Where agreement out of court
cannot be achieved an application to court for an order granting leave to use the materials
will be required. Any application to vary or rescind the whole or part of a privacy order so
as to permit the use of material which is the subject of that order, outside those proceedings,
should be made in the proceedings to which the order relates by way of summons. Where
proceedings have already closed the application should be made by Representation.372 The
application is a question of law and will be determined by the judge sitting alone without
Jurats. All of the parties to the private hearing must be convened to the summons in order
for those parties to make submissions on the implied undertaking and the privacy order.
Close regard should be had to case management where the private material is required
in order to properly plead a claim which is approaching the expiration of a limitation or
prescription period. There can be a considerable delay between the time when the need for
the private materials first becomes apparent and an order giving leave for their use. This is
especially the case where there may be multiple parties to the private proceedings, each of
whom must be convened, review the documents sought to be used, provide instructions,
file responses to the summons and be heard at the hearing, that is to say nothing of the
Court's diary.
The summons must be served with a supporting affidavit.373 The applicant should compile
a schedule of documents sought to be used which should be appended to the summons.
Close regard should be had to which category the document(s) fall(s) into: whether subject
to the implied undertaking, the privacy order (both) or neither.374

3-142

The applicant's affidavit accompanying the summons should set out in detail the relationship between the documents sought and the reasons why they are required. The Court will
be looking for an alignment between the probative value of the documents to the issues
or likely issues in the litigation for which they are sought. The affidavit argument should
set out the consequences for the applicant if leave is refused and any other relevant factors
in the Court's decision (such as an impending limitation or other procedural deadline).
Where a date for a first hearing cannot be coordinated by agreement between the parties
and the Royal Court a date-fix appointment will be necessary.375

The Representation to determine the application for leave will itself be heard in private as to hold the
proceedings in public would reveal the contents of the private hearing.

ii. What Material Can the Court Release?
3-146 No permission is needed to use material that is in the possession of the party seeking leave,
if their possession of such material arises independently of the private hearing, provided in
doing so neither the party nor the material reveals (1) that the material was used in a private
hearing or (2) the contents of that hearing.376 The Court will not grant leave for the use of
material that is privileged unless it can be demonstrated that privilege has been waived.377 It
is not the role of the applicant to identify documents that may be privileged in the hands of
other parties to the private proceedings. It is the responsibility of the party whose privilege it
is to assert it. Where a defence of privilege is raised, the status of a document will have to be
determined before the Court may authorise its use by the applicant.378 Where no privilege
is asserted or is asserted but found wanting, the Court can grant leave to use the material.379
3-147 The Court will not ordinarily grant leave for the use of material disclosed in Article 51
proceedings that discloses the trustee's reasoning or decision-making process380 (other of
course than that which refers to legal advice which is privileged) unless the trustee has put
itself in a position where it has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign court such that
were leave refused the trustee may be in breach of a court order to provide material relating
to their exercise of their discretion.381
3-148 The Court can grant leave for the use of material that is subject to the implied undertaking.
In a private hearing there is clearly a degree of overlap between material that is subject to
the privacy order and material that is subject to the undertaking. However, the approach
the Court will take to the two categories is distinct and the two categories are not entirely
co-extensive-material such as transcripts of oral evidence in the private proceedings are
not subject to the undertaking, neither is material disclosed voluntarily although such
material would still be subject to privacy.
3-149 It is unclear whether the Court's leave is required for a party to use facts that it has in its
mind (as opposed to material in a document) as a result of having seen or heard material
in the course of private proceedings. This uncertainty is highly unsatisfactory given that if
leave is required and not sought, a party who uses the material and their lawyers will be in
contempt of court. In our view, in the absence of a Jersey decision to the contrary,382 it does.
A fact that cannot be substantiated but by reference to material subject to a privacy order is
likely to be of little practical utility in any event. In practice, it is also likely to be extremely
difficult to silo material in a person's mind from material protected by the privacy order,
particularly if what is in someone's mind is the result of the processing of accumulated
protected material over a period of time. Does the very fact of there having been proceedings in private require the Court's leave? The fact of the proceedings having taken place is
not secret, the Representation will be deposited with the Greffe for tabling in the usual way
and therefore reference to there having been a hearing does not in our view require leave,

provided that in mentioning the fact of the hearing nothing else is revealed as to who was
convened to it or its contents.
In all cases where the Court is sitting in private, it should be addressed on and considered
whether it is appropriate for a judgment to be given in open court announcing the order
which is being made and giving some account of what has happened at the private hearing.383 In order to do this, it is usual that the Court orders the excise of the identities of the
relevant parties from the public judgments in order to preserve the parties' anonymity.

iii. Factors for the Court in Lifting a Privacy Order
Where there is a significant degree of overlap between the two categories of document the
Court has elided the test applicable to whether or not to release material from the implied
undertaking with consideration of what harm will result from the release.384 The Court will
weigh the evidential forensic value of the documents sought to be used, against the genuine
risk of harm to the party whose document it is.385 As in cases where only the implied undertaking is in issue, it is incumbent upon the applicant seeking leave to use material, to particularise
which documents it seeks leave for and to state their reason for seeking to use the material
outside the private proceedings. Where the material is needed in order to prosecute or answer
other claims, the applicant for leave must demonstrate what evidential value the private material has to the matters in issue in the proceedings. Where the material subject to a privacy
order is sought to be used in proceedings, either before the Royal Court or before the court of
another jurisdiction it is not the place of the Court giving leave to make a detailed examination of the merits of the proposed action. The Court need only be satisfied that the proposed
action is to be or has been commenced for a bona fides purpose and is not an abuse of process
or otherwise unsustainable.386 It is incumbent upon the respondents to the application for
leave to identify which particular documents (if any) they object to the use of outside the private hearing and on what basis. A general and un-particularised assertion of harm resulting
from the use of the documents is insufficient. 'Harm' usually requires evidence of harm of a
financial, reputational or operational nature. Furthermore, the harm must be of such a nature
and degree so as to outweigh the injustice cause to the party seeking leave, if leave is refused.

3-151

iv. Costs
A hearing to vary or lift a privacy order is not an application that requires the Court's
involvement in any event; it is possible to truncate the procedure outlined above by the
agreement of all parties out of court. Where the Court finds the objection of the other
parties to the private proceedings baseless then the Court may order costs against that party
and/or deprive that party of their costs from the trust fund. A trustee who assumes a neutral
position will ordinarily be entitled to its costs of the proceedings.387

course which is not bona fides or otherwise an abuse of process or unsustainable.

Litigation Concerning the Existence
of the Trust, the Rectification of its
Terms and the Exercise of Powers
I. Introduction
As in English law, for a Jersey trust to be valid and enforced by the Court, there must be an
intention to create a trust, together with certainty of both subject matter and objects.1 Every
non-charitable trust must be either for the benefit of identifiable individuals,2 or for a noncharitable purpose which can be enforced by the Court.3
Even in those cases where an express trust is on its face valid, Jersey has well-developed
jurisprudence on the doctrines which permit the Court to declare the trust to be invalid, or
liable to have its terms rectified. The Court may declare that a trust is a sham and there is no
trust at all. Such a challenge goes to the genuine intention to create a trust in the first place.
The Court will also intervene to rectify or to set aside a trust (in its entirety or more often
the exercise of particular powers) in order to grant relief from the settlor's (and sometimes
the trustee's) mistake. Closely aligned to the jurisdiction to rescind a transaction for mistake is the jurisdiction, now placed on a statutory footing in Jersey, to challenge the exercise
of a power where it is claimed that, but for a certain mistake, the donee of the power would
not have exercised it as he did.4 As will be apparent, the focus of this chapter is to examine
the basis upon which the intent of the settlor or of a person exercising trust powers can be
vitiated so as to treat the stated or assumed intent as having never been effective to begin
with.

1 At the time of going to press the States of Jersey are currently consulting on a seventh amendment to the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 to permit a trust to be created without certainty of objects from the outset provided it is
possible for a beneficiary to be alive, ascertainable or in existence at some during the trust period (which in Jersey
may be indefinite).
2 Trusts (Jersey) Law, Art 10; In Re Exeter Settlement [2010 JLR 169].
3 Jersey has made express statutory provision in Art 12 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (as amended) for the
possibility of non-charitable purpose trusts which require the appointment of an 'enforcer' who, in the absence
of beneficiaries, has locus to apply to court for the enforcement of the trust under Art 51. See Morice v Bishop of
­Durham (1804) 9 Ves 399, at 404-05, per Sir William Grant: 'There must be somebody, in whose favour the Court
can decree performance'. Prior to the enactment of the Trusts (Amendment No 3) Jersey Law 1996, Jersey's trust
law did not even admit of the possibility of so-called 'trusts of imperfect obligation' for the erection and maintenance of tombs and monuments, for the saying of masses and for maintenance of animals.

Intention and Trusts

II. Sham Trusts
4-3

The classic definition of a sham, as approved by the Royal Court in what is currently the
leading case on the subject,5 comes from the dicta of Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West
Riding Investment Ltd:6
acts done or documents executed by the parties to the 'sham' which are intended by them to give
to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and
obligations different from the actual rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to
create…for acts or documents to be a sham, with whatever legal consequences follow from this, all
the parties thereto must have a common intention that the acts or documents are not to create the
legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating.

4-4

4-5

In Mackinnon, the Jersey Court of Appeal identified the following features in the doctrine
of sham: both the settlor and trustee must have intended that the true position would not
be as set out in the trust instrument, but that either the trust is invalid and of no effect, or
that the assets of the trust were intended to be held for the settlor absolutely, so that the
assets were simply held to the settlor's order; and both the trustee and the settlor intended
to give a false impression to a third party or parties (including the other beneficiaries and
the courts) that the assets had been settled into the trusts and were held on the terms of
the trust instrument.7 Giving a false impression is not to be equated with deceit. What is
required in a case based on sham is a common intention to give a false impression, which
if not strictly a deceit comes very close to dishonesty on the part of the parties to the sham
arrangement.8 The intention that is relevant is the parties' subjective intention.9
A sham can take a number of different forms. Most commonly, sham is used to describe a
situation where there is a document or other evidence that suggests property was settled
into trust, that the property is held on certain terms set out in the trust documents but in
reality the shared intention of both the settlor and the original trustee is for the trustee to
hold the property on trust for the settlor or to his order.10 However, conceptually a sham
can also properly describe a situation where the terms of the trust that are intended by the
settlor and trustee are not reflected in the trust documents but trust assets are not held for
the benefit of the settlor or to his order; eg, a trust that is expressed on its face to be discretionary for the benefit of the settlor's children but is intended actually to be administered
for them on the basis that each has a fixed beneficial interest. Properly understood, there is
no such thing as a 'sham trust'. In reality, each of the above permutations of a sham trust are
just different facets of the same principle; a sham trust is merely a document (or series of

documents) that purport to create a trust, which does not in fact exist because the parties
thereto lack the necessary intention to create a trust.
To allege that a trust is sham is a serious accusation against the probity of both the settlor
and the original trustee and, if such a challenge succeeds, can have devastating consequences for those with a beneficial interest in the trust fund. Challenges to trusts on the
ground of sham are not uncommon. They often arise in claims where there is perceived to
be merit in 'cracking' a trust in order to make assets available for the benefit of a settlor's
former spouse and/or creditors.11 The assets sought to be released may also be tainted as
the proceeds of crime which is sought to be subject to foreign or domestic orders for seizure
and confiscation.12
Notwithstanding the leaps and bounds which have occurred in the last 20 years in terms of
the regulation of Jersey's trust industry, and while fiercely disavowed by those charged with
safeguarding the island's reputation as an international financial centre, it is not unfair to
say that Jersey, along with many other reputable offshore jurisdictions, still battles with the
stubborn perception of those, often outside the island and with little direct experience of
how its trust industry operates, that a Jersey trust always was and continues to be little more
than a glorified bank account for the settlor. Such an impression is sustained by the perception of Jersey as a 'tax haven' where rich, powerful (and sometimes nefarious) people were
and are able to shelter their money from prying eyes using complex corporate and trust
structures administered by obliging and submissive professional trustees. Such an impression is also not easily shaken off in circumstances where the settlor reserves to himself (as is
possible) all the powers listed in Article 9A of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.13 Settlors would
not infrequently make use of fully flexible, discretionary, so-called 'Red-Cross trusts'14 with
boilerplate trust instruments, without named human beneficiaries or naming only the
settlor and his spouse and possibly issue as beneficiaries. Such trusts would frequently be
'governed' by confidential letters of wishes signed by either the real economic settlor or a
so-called 'settlor of convenience' or someone else nominated by either the real economic
settlor or settlor of convenience to give directions to the trustees as to how the assets were
to be managed.15 Before the enactment of specific legislation making it clear that the use
of 'reserved powers' by settlors would not have the effect of invalidating a trust,16 settlors
may also have had a had a very hands-on approach to the management, use of and benefit
from trust assets which may have been unsupported by or in contradiction with the trust's
constitutive documents.

See Ch 14, although it is not necessary for the assets to vest in the settlor for the assets to be subject to an
order for confiscation or to be subject to an external civil asset recovery order under the Civil Asset Recovery
(International Co-operation) (Jersey) Law 2007.
13 At the time of writing the States of Jersey is consulting on a seventh amendment to the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984 to provide statutory clarification that as well as reserving all of the Art 9A powers, the settlor may reserve to
themselves the entire beneficial interest in the trust assets and for the trust still be valid under Jersey law.

Intention and Trusts

A. The Shamming Intent
4-8

4-9

In addition to the intention not to give effect to the trusts, the Jersey authorities speak of
a requirement to intend to give a false impression.17 The shamming intent is a subjective
intent and must be shared by both the settlor and the trustee.18 It is difficult to establish the
necessary intent, because a finding of sham carries with it a finding of dishonesty, because
innocent third parties may often rely on the apparent genuineness of the trust provisions,
and because the Court places great weight on the existence and provisions of formal signed
documents.19 Reckless indifference, ie the acceptance of the office of trustee without the
trustee knowing or caring what it had signed up to, will be taken to amount to the necessary
intention for these purposes.20 There is New Zealand authority21 that ignorance on the part
of the trustee is tantamount to intention. There is no Jersey authority on this point but in
our view ignorance would not be tantamount to intention unless it involved a wilful shutting of the eyes to what would otherwise be obvious.
An allegation that a Jersey trust structure is a sham (other than those challenges made in
courts outside Jersey, which are far more common)22 is largely now confined to so-called
'legacy structures', ie those established long before the modern regulatory regime governing
trust company business administered by the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC).
Since 1998, the JFSC's heavy emphasis on the requirement that a professional trustee must
conduct its business with integrity23 makes sham, with its inherent requirement that the
trustee be party to a dishonest arrangement, an inherently unlikely conclusion for the
Court to reach without significant and cogent evidence in support.24 Subsequent actions
of the parties to the trust in disregarding the trusts declared are admissible to establish that
they intended at the time when the trusts were declared never to carry them out.25 If the
shamming intent is not established to exist at the outset of the trust then the trustee's conduct in subsequently disregarding the trusts is simply to be regarded as a breach of trust.26
This means that as a matter of Jersey law, a trust cannot, in its entirety, become a sham by
prescription or by being administered in a way inconsistent with its apparent terms with
the effluxion of time. The evidence of conduct subsequent to the establishment of the trust
that demonstrates a disregard from the terms of the trust serves to displace a rebuttable

Sham Trusts

presumption that the trust, when settled, was intended by the settlor and trustee to be valid.
The Royal Court in the seminal Esteem litigation suggested (obiter and without the benefit
of argument) that individual settlements into a trust may be held to be a sham even if the
trust under which those settlements are made is otherwise valid if the requisite intention
can be proven in respect of those individual settlements.27
If the trustee acts in disregard of the terms of the trust by slavishly complying with the
settlor's wishes about the administration of the trust, that may point towards a shamming
intent. However, subject to the terms of the trust, the trustee is entitled to consider the
settlor's wishes or guidance in the exercise of their dispositive and administrative ­powers
and provided they exercise their own discretions under the trusts in doing so then the
settlor's influence can usually be disregarded as evidence pointing to a shamming intent.28
An 'alter ego' trust, where a person establishes a trust over the trustee of which he has control, is not, by virtue of this fact, a sham nor does the person with control of the trustee
thereby have or acquire a beneficial interest under the trust.29 The mere retention of wide
powers and a beneficial interests by the settlor does not of itself make the trust a sham, so
long as the trustee genuinely has control of the assets and exercises his own independent
discretions in respect of those matters where the terms of the trust require him to do so.30
On its proper construction, a trust in which a settlor retains wide beneficial interests and
powers might be held to be a bare trust,31 but such an arrangement is entirely different from
alleging that the settlor was party to a sham. Despite potential difficulties with the perception of doing so in courts outside of Jersey alluded to earlier, there is nothing inherently
sinister in a Jersey trust having as its only beneficiary the International Committee of the
Red Cross, leaving other beneficiaries to be appointed from a very wide (but sufficiently
conceptually certain) class of potential objects.32
If a trustee of a trust, which is not itself alleged to be a sham, has a power to transfer trust
assets to another trust, and purport to exercise the power in a way which would be authorised by the power if the transferee trust were genuine, the Court will not lightly infer that
the transfer and transferee trust were shams and that the true intention of the trustees
making the transfer was that the transferred assets should become held, in breach of trust,
for a third party; but if the inference is made then the transferred assets will remain held
on the trusts of the transferor trust and not in trust for the third party who was intended
to benefit.33

30 See n 13 above. While such a trust may be valid in Jersey, such a trust is likely to raise eyebrows in courts
outside Jersey and a settlor establishing such a trust should not be given the impression that the trust is immune
from challenge.
31 eg, were the settlor to reserve to himself all of the powers in the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 9A(2) the settlor
would achieve something very close to absolute beneficial ownership of the trust property.

Intention and Trusts

B. The Position of the Original Trustee
4-12

In Jersey law, as in English law, for a trust to be a sham, the original trustee must share the
settlor's shamming intent at the time of the constitution of the trust.34 It follows that if the
original trustee does not share the settlor's intent then the settlor's private intention that
the instrument should be a sham will have no effect on the status of the trust. If the original
trustees receive assets intending to hold them subject to the terms of the trust instrument,
any later arrangement with the settlor to treat the trust as a sham will constitute a breach of
trust and will not convert an otherwise valid trust into a sham trust.35 If the original trustee
accepts the settlement of additional assets into trust which they have agreed to hold for the
settlor's benefit (or on different trusts to those declared in the trust instrument), there may
be a sham in relation to those assets alone.36

C. The Appointment of Subsequent or New Trustees
4-13

If, as will often happen, the original trustee retires and new trustee or trustees are appointed
in its place, two questions arise: first, has the original trustee been a party to a sham and,
secondly, whether the new trustees are also parties to the same sham. If the original trustee
is not a party to a sham but the settlor and the incoming new trustee have agreed to hold the
assets for the settlor's benefit (or on different trusts from those declared in the trust instrument) then the trusts are valid and the appointment of the new shamming trustee will not
have the effect of making the otherwise valid trust a sham, for the same reasons that it is not
possible for a trust that is established without a shamming intent to subsequently become
a sham trust because the settlor and trustee agree to that. However, if the original trustees
were parties to a sham then the appointment of new trustees who do not share the shamming intent may convert the sham into a valid trust-the common intention will have been
broken.37 If both the original and new trustee shares the same shamming intent then the
sham will continue. Where trusts are declared by trustees by way of a re-settlement, under a
power conferred on them by an existing settlement, the trustee's intention alone is sufficient
to establish a sham.38

D. The Effect of Finding a Sham
4-14

A trust held to be a sham is void ab initio and the trust property is to be treated, by third
parties such as creditors, revenue authorities, trustees in bankruptcy or ex-spouses and

Co Ltd (n 26), affirming Shalson v Russo (n 26).
35 MacKinnon v Regent Trust Co Ltd (n 5); In re Esteem Settlement (n 18). See also Shalson v Russo (n 27) at
[190], where it was said that 'unless that intention (ie the intention to treat the assets as belonging to the settlor) is
from the outset shared by the trustee (or later becomes shared), I fail to see how the settlement can be regarded as
a sham'. The words in brackets ('or later becomes shared') were questioned in Hill v Spread Trustee Co Ltd (n 20);
and must be treated as having been said per incuriam. The better analysis is that a trustee who agrees with a settlor
to depart from the terms of the trust is to be regarded as acting in breach of trust and as an accessory respectively.

legatees as still belonging to the settlor or his estate. There is authority (although none
of it from Jersey)39 that where the acts and documents reflect a transaction divisible into
separate parts, a transaction is a sham as to only part of the transaction,40 so as to sever the
sham provisions and the other remaining provisions which are valid despite the finding of
a shamming intent.

E. Reliance on the Sham by the Settlor and Trustee
In a series of recent English cases, and as a matter of principle, the parties to a declaration of
trust cannot rely on their own shamming intent as against innocent third parties. If the declaration of trust is a sham or pretence, then 'as against an innocent third party it cannot lie
in the mouths of the pretenders to say to the disadvantage of that innocent third party that
the transaction was a sham, pretence and thus of no effect'.41 For a settlor or trustee to rely
on their own shamming intent as against innocent third parties would mean them relying
on their own wrongful intent to give a false impression to the outside world, of which they
would not normally be permitted to lead evidence, at least where it is coupled with reliance
upon some illegal intention so as to come within the ex turpi causa or illegality principle.42
The essential rationale of what is known as the illegality doctrine, according to a recent UK
Supreme Court decision,43 is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a
claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system. In assessing whether
the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary to consider (1) the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will
be enhanced by denial of the claim; (2) any other relevant public policy on which the denial
of the claim may have an impact; and (3) whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality. In considering whether it would be disproportionate to
refuse relief to which the plaintiff would otherwise be entitled, as a matter of public policy,
various factors may be relevant. Potentially relevant factors include the seriousness of the
conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it was intentional and whether there was
marked disparity in the parties' respective culpability. It seems to us that this general rule is
capable of being applied to prevent a claim by a settlor or a trustee (perhaps being sued by
a beneficiary for breach of trust) to deprive the beneficiary of locus by setting aside a trust
on the grounds that the trustee and the settlor intended the trust to be a sham. The key
point is that although an intention to mislead is required for a finding of sham, there need
not be any strict illegality involved (at any rate at the point at which the sham ­declaration is

executed); and so it appears that there may be circumstances where the dishonesty involved
in the execution of a trust intended as a sham will not prevent the settlor or trustee from
later asserting the sham, provided any illegal intention was never carried into effect.44 If
third parties have relied on the provisions of the trust instrument to their detriment, the
settlor (and for the same reason) may be estopped from asserting that the trust is a sham
and from seeking to recover the trust property.45

F. Reliance by those who are not Parties to the Sham
4-16

If there ever were any subsequently appointed trustees who were not implicated in the
sham, and did not know of it when appointed, they would do well to apply to court as soon
as they discovered it. They would not be giving evidence of their own wrongful intent,
but that of their predecessors. A different example would be where the true arrangement
(behind the apparent trust created for tax reasons) is that the trust fund should be held,
not on the trusts expressed in the trust deed, but on trusts for a particular person (not the
settlor) absolutely on the basis of a constructive trust or of a valid oral declaration of trust.
In our view it is clear that, in such circumstances, the 'real' beneficiary can enforce the 'true'
trusts in his favour. It may even be that he can do so without the need to assert the existence
of a sham (and so without alleging dishonesty), if the 'true' trusts are constituted before the
execution of the sham document and so take priority over it.

G. The Relationship between Settlor Reserved Powers,
Interests and Control
4-17

4-18

So long as the trusts are intended to take effect according to their terms, the retention of
wide powers or weighty influence over the trustee or the administration of the trust assets
by the settlor does not, of itself, make the trusts a sham.46 If the powers that are retained
are within the scope of Article 9A of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, then as a matter of Jersey
law at least, such retention is not capable of being construed as the trusts being intended as
a testamentary instrument so as to require them to be in compliance with the formalities
required of Jersey wills, though it might create a bare trust for the settlor so that the trust
property falls into his estate on his death, but the trusts, while the settlor still lives, would
still be valid and not a sham.
A trust is either a sham in the sense described above and is invalid or it is not and is valid
and enforceable. There is simply no middle state between a valid trust and a sham.47 If the
settlor retains power to direct investments, that does not make the trust a sham.48 Indeed,
where the settlor directs investments through the internal machinery of the trust that would
seem to affirm the trust as being valid and not a sham. Even if the settlor retains practical

control of the whole administration of the trust through informal, personal influence over
the trustees, that does not enable his creditors to 'pierce the veil of the trust' which Jersey
does not recognise as a doctrine that applies to the institution of the trust.49

H. The Proper Law Governing the Question whether a Trust is a Sham
The significance of this question arises because whether a Jersey trust is a sham is a question that goes to the validity of the trust and thus is subject to the firewall protection found
in Article 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 which requires a foreign court to apply Jersey
law to the issue before that foreign decision is capable of being given effect to by the Jersey
Court.50 Where there is a competing forum in which the issue of sham in relation to a Jersey trust arises, this is likely to be given weight in the Court's evaluation of whether Jersey,
rather than that competing jurisdiction, is clearly the most appropriate forum in which to
have the dispute.51 While there is a great deal of affinity between Jersey and English law on
the question of sham (if perhaps a divergence in the willingness of some Courts in some
quarters to make such a finding) if, in the future, a divergence emerged between Jersey and
other jurisdictions on the substantive law governing sham arrangements,52 then the issue
of which law governs the question of whether a trust is a sham would acquire a new significance. There are two possible alternative answers to the question: the first is to apply the law
of the lex situs of the trust property. In our view this approach is incorrect, a view which is
supported by Jersey authority and by the English Court of Appeal.53 The alternative, and in
our view, the correct approach is, by analogy with the position in contract to apply the law
that would apply to the trust assuming it to be valid.54 Most modern drafted Jersey trusts
contain a governing or proper law clause designating Jersey to be the proper law of the trust
for the purposes of Article 4 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. Where, as is often the case, the
trust contains a power to change the proper law of the trust so as to create an ambulatory
proper law, the question of sham will remain rooted to the proper law of the jurisdiction
(1) which is nominated as the proper law or (2) with which the trust at the time it was
created had the closest connection, whichever proper law comes to govern the settlement
during its l­ifetime.55 The Royal Court has long considered it an exorbitant assumption of
jurisdiction for a foreign court, particularly the Family Division of the English High Court
in the context of applications for ancillary relief affecting Jersey trusts, under section 24 of
the M
­ atrimonial Causes Act 1973, to declare a Jersey trust to be a sham without recourse to
Jersey law on that q
­ uestion.56 The solution is therefore either to obtain admissible expert

evidence of Jersey law for admission into foreign proceedings, to circumvent the firewall
provisions,57 or to commence proceedings in Jersey in tandem with proceedings elsewhere
for a Jersey determination on the question of sham. An issue like sham, that goes to the
very existence of a trust and that requires the application of Jersey law (and by virtue of
Article 9, only Jersey law) is likely to be a factor of significant weight in favour of the Royal
Court assuming jurisdiction over a trust dispute in its assessment of whether Jersey is forum
conveniens.58

III. Jersey's Rules as to Rescission for Mistake
4-20

4-21

The law relating to rescission on the grounds of mistake as it applies to trusts has had an
extensive airing before courts in Jersey and England and Wales in recent years. That judicial
attention is down, in no small order, to the fiscal consequences of a trust now often being
the major if not the motivating factor for its creation. When the fiscal consequences of a
disposition into or from a trust go awry there usually follows an intense focus on the subjective intention of those who have caused the mistake.
The Royal Court will rescind, ie set aside, a disposition of property into or from a trust if it
is satisfied that the settlor or the trustee59 was acting under a mistake of so serious a character as to render it unjust on the part of the donee of the property to retain it and that but for
the mistake the disposition would not have been made.60 An order to rescind on grounds
of mistake operates so as to treat the disposition as having never been made at all. Where
an order for rescission is obtained by the settlor, the trustee will hold the assets, together
with any profit derived from them, on bare trust for the settlor.61 Closely related to mistake
as a basis upon which to rescind a disposition into or out of a trust is the jurisdiction to
challenge the exercise of a power under the principle which has become known as 'the Rule
in Re Hastings-Bass'62 under which it is possible to claim that, but for a certain mistake, the
donee of the power (usually the trustee) would not have exercised it as he did.

Rescission for Mistake

201

­ ecision, which can broadly be described as approving the line of authorities beginning
d
with Ogilvie v Littleboy64 in preference to those beginning with Gibbon v Mitchell,65 has
aligned the English law position with that which has operated in Jersey for many years.66
A transaction that is vitiated by an operative mistake is voidable at the insistence of the
applicant and not void ab initio.67 On both sides of the English Channel, the test for rescission for mistake has been aligned so that now there must simply be evidence of a causative
mistake of sufficient gravity to render it unjust or unconscionable on the part of the donee
to retain the property given to him.68 This test will normally be satisfied when there is a
mistake either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction, or as to some matter of
fact or law which is basic to the transaction.69 We consider that it will suffice that the trust
would not have been made in the terms in which it was made but for the mistake, and that
it is not necessary to show that it would not have been made at all.70 The assessment of what
is or would be unconscionable is an objective one. The gravity or seriousness of the mistake
has to be assessed by a close examination of the specific facts. Those facts may be tested by
cross-examination but the mistake may be so obvious as to be apparent on the face of the
paper evidence. The Court will need to be appraised of the circumstances of the mistake
and its consequences. The mistake may be of fact or of law.71 A mistake as to the fiscal effect
(or the fiscal consequences) (which from the cases are invariably unfavourable) of a voluntary disposition may suffice to enable the Court to rescind the disposition. However, note
Lord Walker's chilling warning that:
In some cases of artificial tax avoidance the court might think it right to refuse relief, either on
the ground that such plaintiffs, must be taken to have accepted the risk that the scheme would
prove ineffective, or on the ground that discretionary relief should be refused on grounds of public
policy.72

The Royal Court has expressed itself as seeing there to be no need for it to strive to protect
the interests of HMRC,73 although the Court will not shut its eyes to tax avoidance in the
exercise of its discretion.74 The fact that the settlor forgot, did not know about or overlooked, a specific fact or a legal requirement does not itself suffice to invoke the jurisdiction,
but it can lead to a false belief or assumption which the Court will recognise as an operative
mistake.75 Mere ignorance of a fact is not enough, even if it can be said to have caused the

disposition to be made. For ignorance to become operative, the Court must be prepared
to draw an inference that it represented a mistaken conscious belief or a mistaken tacit
assumption.76 A settlor who believes he has a normal life expectancy, so that the creation by
him of an inter vivos settlement will have inheritance tax advantages, but is in fact suffering
from a terminal or degenerative illness at the time when he creates a trust, may have a mistaken conscious belief or mistaken tacit assumption which will allow the disposition to be
set aside.77 A mis-prediction of future events is not an operative mistake. However, if there
is a mistaken conscious belief or tacit assumption as to future events it does not matter
whether it is owing to carelessness on the part of the settlor or donor, unless he deliberately
ran the risk or must have taken the risk of being wrong. The mistake need not be known to
the person or persons taking the benefit under the disposition.78

B. The Rule in Re Hastings Bass and Applications under
Articles 47E to 47I of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
4-24

Jersey has long recognised and incorporated wholesale into its own law,79 what has come
to be known as 'the Rule in Re Hastings Bass'.80 The jurisdiction has become an important
feature in the landscape of Jersey trust practice and provides significant comfort to trustees.
The latest restatement of the rule in Jersey, prior to the Pitt v Holt appeals, was that given
by Lloyd J in Sieff v Fox:81
Where trustees act under a discretion given to them by the terms of the trust, in circumstances in
which they are free to decide whether or not to exercise that discretion, but the effect of the exercise
is different from that which they intended, the court will interfere with their action if it is clear that
they would not have acted as they did had they not failed to take into account considerations which
they ought to have taken into account, or taken into account considerations which they ought not
to have taken into account.82

4-25

As is well known the rule has developed predominantly as a tool by which trustees are able
to effectively turn the clock back on the exercise of (usually a dispositive) power where the

76 ibid, at [108]: 'The court cannot decide what is unconscionable by an elaborate set of rules but must always
form a judgment about the justice of the case in hand', per Lord Walker at [127]-[128].
77 ibid, at [109]-[113]. However, the Court may refuse relief where the donees of the interests appointed under
a trust retained those interests where they were collectively aware of the settlor's medical problems see In Re B Life
Settlement (n 66).
78 In Re B Life Interest Settlement (n 66). The issue of unconscionability will involve an assessment of their position, above all where they have changed their position in some way as a result of the disposition in their favour.
79 See In The Matter Of The Green GLG Trust [2002 JLR 571] at [27]: 'We consider that the Hastings-Bass principle is entirely consistent with precedent and principle'.
80 [1975] Ch 25 expressed in the following terms: 'where by the terms of a trust (as under section 32) a trustee
is given a discretion as to some matter under which he acts in good faith, the court should not interfere with his
action notwithstanding that it does not have the full effect which he intended, unless (1) what he has achieved is
unauthorised by the power conferred upon him, or (2) it is clear that he would not have acted as he did (a) had
he not taken into account considerations which he should not have taken into account, or (b) had he not failed to
take into account considerations which he ought to have taken into account'. The rule is something of a misnomer
as found by the English Court of Appeal in Pitt v Holt [2011] EWCA Civ 197 when the rule, as it had developed in
the intervening 30 years, was extensively analysed.

exercise of that power gave rise to an unintended or unforeseen (and invariably negative)
tax consequence. The rule at English common law was derived from the law of powers
and so remains confined only to trustees or other fiduciaries who are vested with fiduciary
powers. The first, fundamental question is whether the person exercising the power sought
to be avoided using the rule had such a power at all. Neither the rule at common law nor
the language of the Jersey statutory provisions is apt to save cases of excessive execution,
whether procedural or substantive (ie where the exercise of the power is not within the four
corners of the power, such as an appointment to a non-beneficiary)83 but cases of excessive
execution are void ab initio and do fall within the pre-Pitt v Holt formulation of the rule
in Re Hastings Bass in any event, which is concerned with the substantive, rather than the
formal validity of the exercise of a power. The rule has no application to enable a settlor
to reverse a disposition made by him directly into trust84 as no question of power arises
(although a settlor may be able to avail himself of the allied and closely related in effect,
though conceptually distinct, rules governing rescission for mistake). The scope of the rule
had been developed by the Royal Court beyond dispositive powers into administrative85
and investment86 powers vested in trustees.
The position at English common law prior to the Pitt v Holt decisions was that the jurisdiction to reverse a transaction under the rule in Re Hastings Bass was available irrespective of
whether there was negligence on behalf of the fiduciary or its professional advisors. This
position has been preserved by the new legislation.87 The Jersey and English positions in
this regard are now at odds: the availability of the relief in English law is now dependent
on there having been a breach of duty by the fiduciary to come within the rule. Where a
fiduciary takes professional advice, which is wrong, resulting in an unfavourable outcome
following the exercise of the power, the fiduciary is not within the scope of the rule and the
appropriate remedy is to seek redress against the professional advisor. The no-fault, Jersey
approach makes the Re Hastings Bass jurisdiction a very efficient means of loss allocation as
between the trustee, the beneficiaries and the professional services industry.

C. Articles 47B to 47I of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
Following the English Court of Appeal's decision88 but prior to the UK Supreme Court's
judgment in the conjoined appeals of Pitt v Holt and Futter v Futter,89 Jersey's States set
about drafting an amendment to the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.90 That amendment, taking
effect as of 25 October 2013, had the effect of creating, in statutory form, a jurisdiction
identical to that under 'the rule In re Hastings-Bass'91 as formulated immediately prior to

Intention and Trusts

the Court of Appeal decision in Pitt v Holt and a jurisdiction identical to that which already
existed in Jersey at common law for rescission for mistake.92 Formally, judgments of the
English Court of Appeal and UK Supreme Court are not binding on Jersey and therefore no
such amendment was strictly necessary. However, the dramatic re-casting of the Re Hastings
Bass jurisdiction by the English Court of Appeal in Pitt v Holt,93 that 'the Rule in Re Hastings
Bass', was not in fact a rule at all (or at least not in the terms hitherto understood), lead to
considerable disquiet in Jersey as to whether the theoretical foundation of the Jersey cases,
that had adopted the rule, had collapsed so as to require Jersey to construct a new juridical basis for the rule if it was to survive.94 The solution was a series of complex provisions
inserted as Articles 47B-47J of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. These provisions are within
Part 2 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law and therefore only apply to trusts which have Jersey as their
proper law.95 However, the instrument that exercises the power that is sought to be set aside
need not be governed by Jersey law, provided the trust is.96 Jersey's firewall provisions97
provide that the validity of a Jersey trust and validity and effect of any transfer of property
into a Jersey trust shall be determined in accordance with the law of Jersey and no rule of
foreign law shall affect such question.98
The new legislative provisions may be summarised as follows: Articles 47E and 47G provide
a statutory re-enactment, in the widest possible terms, of the jurisdiction to rescind for
mistake. Articles 47F and 47H provide a statutory jurisdiction that encompasses the effect
of the rule in Re Hastings Bass, as formulated prior to the Pitt v Holt decisions in England.
First, so far as concerns the statutory jurisdiction to rescind transfers or other dispositions
of property to a trust, or to rescind the exercise of power over or in relation to a trust or
trust property that are vitiated by a mistake, a relevant mistake has been defined as widely as
it could possibly be by Article 47B(2) to include a mistake to the effect, the consequences99
or any advantages to be gained from the disposition or the exercise of such power, and
includes mistakes of pre-existing or contemporaneous facts, or law (including foreign law).
Under Article 47E, settlors or their successors in title or heirs100 may apply for a declaration
from the Court that a transfer or disposition into a trust by the settlor or his or her agent101
is voidable, and either of no effect or such effect as the Court may determine, if and only if,
the disponor made a mistake (as defined) in relation to the transaction, he would not have

effected the transaction but for the mistake, and the mistake is of so serious a character as
to render it just for relief to be given. Under Article 47G, donees of a power (be they trustees or otherwise), the trustee, or a beneficiary or enforcer of an affected trust, the Attorney
General where the affected trust is charitable, or any other person with leave of the Court,
may also apply for a declaration that the exercise of a power by a trustee or other fiduciary,
or a donee of a power, over or in relation to a trust or trust property, is voidable, on grounds
of a mistake (as defined).
As will be readily apparent, Articles 47E and 47G (mistake) do not add anything to the position concerning the jurisdiction to rescind at common law in Jersey. Having long followed
the far more open-textured and contextual test for mistake in the In re A Trust102 line of
cases,103 the definition of a qualifying mistake needed neither widening nor clarification
in Jersey, and the test for relief as set out in the case law has simply been transposed into
statutory form.
As regards the statutory Hastings-Bass remedies, Article 47F concerns transfers or dispositions of property to a trust which occurs in consequence of the exercise of a fiduciary power.
Settlors, or their successors in title or heirs, may apply for a declaration from the Court
that a transfer or disposition into a trust by their fiduciary104 is voidable, and either of no
effect105 or such effect as the Court may determine, if and only if the power was exercised in
such a way that the donee (1) failed to take into account all relevant considerations or took
into account irrelevant considerations; and (2) would not have exercised the power, either
at all or in the manner it was so exercised but for that failing, it being irrelevant whether
there was any lack of care or fault by the donee or any person giving advice in relation to
the exercise of the power. It is tolerably clear that Article 47F is directed to cover a situation
in which a settlor does not settle property directly onto trustees106 but instead places the
property in the hands of a nominee or bare trustee for the settlor who then settles it into
trust at the direction of the settlor. Article 47H applies to simple exercises of power over or
in relation to a trust or trust property. Like at common law, the power does not have to be
of a fiduciary character. Donees of a power (be they trustees or otherwise), the trustee, or a
beneficiary or enforcer of an affected trust, the Attorney General where the affected trust is
charitable, or any other person with leave of the Court, may also apply for a declaration that
the exercise of a power by a trustee or other fiduciary over or in relation to a trust or trust
property, is voidable as aforesaid, on the equivalent grounds.
It is further provided that no declaration may be made which would prejudice any bona
fides purchaser for value of any trust property without notice of the matters which render the transfer, disposition or exercise of power voidable,107 that the Court can make

c­ onsequential related orders, such as orders for the recovery of distributions, or as to what
the trustee should do next108 and that a transaction that is set aside under Articles 47E to
47H shall be without prejudice to any personal remedy which may be available against a
trustee or any other person.109 The legislation also provides that Articles 47E to 47H are not
exhaustive as the grounds upon which it is possible to make an application for a declaration
that a transfer or other disposition of property to a trust, or the exercise of any power over
or in relation to a trust or trust property, is void or voidable.110
The effect of a qualifying mistake is to reverse a transfer of property into trust so as to
treat it as though there had never been a transfer.111 However, there is Jersey authority that
Articles 47E and 47G have no application to a mistake, the effect of which is to reverse the
entire transfer of trust property so as to leave the trust effectively empty.112 In Jersey law, as
in English law, a trust cannot continue without property subject to the trust.
In the authors' view, there is a possibility that the Strathmullen, which confines the application of Articles 47E and 47G only to applications to set aside a transfer for mistake that
would not have the effect of extinguishing the trust by the application of those provisions,
may be incorrect. An operative mistake amounts to a failure in the settlor's dispositive
intent. The Court in the Strathmullen decision does not seem to have considered that a
transfer of trust property which is subject to a successful challenge on grounds of mistake,
if vested in the trustee, could be said, on orthodox trust principles, to still be subject to a
trust: a bare trust in favour of the settlor. However, given Article 47E and 47G effectively
replicate and do not abolish Jersey's pre-existing common law rules governing rescission
for mistake, the Court's favoured approach in Strathmullen may amount to a distinction
without a difference.

D. What Remains of the Rule in Re Hastings Bass at Common Law?
4-34

There is Jersey authority that the rules governing rescission for mistake survive and are
independent of the Trusts (Amendment No 6) (Jersey) Law 2013.113 The 2013 legislation
does not expressly repeal the rule at common law and there is relatively recent authority
for the proposition that a statute must clearly abolish or override a rule of customary law
which, if taken to be a statement of the Jersey position of the doctrine of implied repeal,
preserves the rule at common law.114 Strathmullen may not be a reliable basis upon which to
assume that the pre Pitt v Holt formulation of the rule in Re Hastings Bass survives in J­ ersey
at common law. The jurisdiction to rescind for mistake in England is now aligned with

Rescission for Mistake

207

the common law position that has long existed in Jersey and the 2013 legislation merely
­replicates the rule at common law. The issue is not whether the rule in Re Hastings Bass survived the Trusts (Amendment No 6) (Jersey) Law 2013 but whether the rule at common law
in Jersey survived the English decisions in Pitt v Holt. There has yet to be a reported Jersey
decision on the scope (or even the survival) of the common law rule in Jersey. Doubt has
been expressed as to the survival of the common law rule in Jersey following Pitt v Holt.115
In re B Life Interest Settlement,116 the exercise of the power in question has held not fall
within the ambit for relief under the formulation of the Hastings-Bass rule prior to Pitt
v Holt anyway and so it was unnecessary to determine whether the Royal Court should follow the narrower approach of the English Court of Appeal. The Court did, however, express
a provisional view that, in light of the current Jersey and English authorities, if it had been
required to make a decision, it would have held that the previous Jersey cases applying the
Hastings-Bass principle were wrong. The English Court of Appeal's decision in Pitt v Holt,
now confirmed by the UK Supreme Court, was a significant watershed for the ambit of the
rule at common law. The English Court of Appeal's decision has effectively demolished the
sub-stratum upon which the rule was built. The Jersey authorities prior to Pitt v Holt are
based upon the adoption of that sub-stratum and provide no other conceptual basis upon
which the rule could survive in Jersey in its pre Pitt v Holt formulation. Given the Privy
Council's position at the apex of the Jersey court system, composed of largely the same
individuals as the UK Supreme Court, were a case that relied on the rule at common law
to be appealed to the Privy Council, there would be a significant risk that the Court would
seek to align the common law of Jersey with that (now) of England. Historically, appeals
against the application of the rule have been rare as the outcome is generally favourable to
all parties other than (usually) the revenue agency that has lost out on tax avoided by the
reversal of the relevant transaction. The continuing moral opprobrium heaped on offshore
jurisdictions such as Jersey for being seen to facilitate tax avoidance, a practice described in
Pitt v Holt as 'a social evil which puts an unfair burden on the shoulders of those who do not
adopt such measures',117 would seem to make the prospects of an alignment more rather
than less likely if the Privy Council were to be given the opportunity. By contrast, the Privy
Council would have far less scope to attack or seek to narrow the application of the rule
that falls squarely within statutory provisions which are an expression of a deliberate policy
choice by a politically independent jurisdiction.
In reality, it may not matter whether the common law rule survives. The Trusts
(­Amendment No 6) (Jersey) Law 2013 is expressed to be both prospective and retroactive
in effect so any fiduciary or trustee wishing to set aside the exercise of any power over or
in relation to a trust or trust property occurring before or after 25 October 2013 can avail
itself of Articles 47F and 47H without needing to resort to the common law rule.118 It is
difficult to imagine a factual scenario that would fall without the very broad scope of the
Articles 47F and 47H.

IV. Rectification and Construction of Trust Documents
4-36

4-37

4-38

The remedies of rectification and rescission for mistake are conceptually distinct, but the
circumstances in which they may be available have the potential to overlap. Both rectification and rescission form part of the Royal Court's equitable jurisdiction to relieve parties of
the consequences of their mistakes.119 As a matter of practice, the remedies of rectification
and rescission on the basis of mistake may often be sought in the alternative and the Royal
Court may well ask whether it is appropriate to rectify a settlement before considering
whether, in its discretion, it ought to be set aside, even where the plaintiff seeks only its
rescission.120
The remedy of rectification proceeds on the basis that a given transaction, which is valid
and not subject to any flaws is wrongly recorded in a written instrument. The Court has a
discretion to rectify the written document (including for our purposes a trust instrument
or any instrument executed under it)121 which does not give effect to the true intention of
the maker of that instrument, whether as a result of ignorance or mistake, so as to make
the document read as being in accordance with what the parties or party to the document
intended. The rectification of a document has the effect of 're-writing' the document to
accord with the settlor's original intention. It is therefore retrospective in effect; treating the
document as always having always been, ab initio, as rectified.122 Rectification is therefore
strictly limited to some clearly established disparity between the words of a legal document
and the intentions of the parties to it.123
The English Court of Appeal has described rectification in the following terms from which
we do not demure:124
[R]ectification is about putting the record straight. In the case of a voluntary settlement, rectification involves bringing the trust document into line with the true intentions of the settlor as held by
him at the date when he executed the document. This can be done by the court when, owing to a
mistake in the drafting of the document, it fails to record the settlor's true intentions. The mistake
may, for example, consist of leaving out words that were intended to be put into the document; or
putting in words that were not intended to be in the document; or through a misunderstanding by
those involved about the meanings of the words or expressions that were used in the document.
Mistakes of this kind have the effect that the document, as executed, is not a true record of the
settlor's intentions.

The relevant intention is that of the maker of the trust instrument, ie the settlor, or in the
case of an instrument executed to give effect to a power under the trust, the relevant power

holder. Where the settlor or power holder is a corporate entity rather than a natural person,
the relevant intention is the intention of the directors (in the case of a company) or the
equivalent of directors in the case of any other corporate entity (eg a council in the case of
a Jersey foundation) that cause the corporate person to execute the relevant document.125
In the case of rectification, the party seeking the remedy must prove the existence of a
specific intention which, as a result of a mistake, is not recorded or is mis-recorded. A general intention to achieve a certain fiscal objective is not enough. The focus of the Court's
enquiry is whether the evidence proves an intention to include specific words or to achieve
a specific intention which is not achieved by reason of a mistake in the drafting.
The leading modern authority on the Jersey law of rectification is In Re Sesemann Will
Trust.126 The three requirements are, first, that there is sufficient evidence of a genuine mistake having been made so that the document sought to be rectified does not accord with
the true intentions of the party(ies) to it. Secondly, that there is no other practical remedy
available to the parties and the third requirement (which is more a rule of procedure rather
than a substantive part of the test) is that there must be full and frank disclosure of all facts
relevant to the Court's discretion.
There is no conceptual limit on the type of mistake that fails to accord with the maker of a
document's true intentions that is capable of giving rise to a claim for rectification.127 The
Court will not lightly rectify a voluntary settlement, and will be more easily satisfied if the
application is supported by other evidence, such as the settlor's contemporaneous written
instructions.128 Many of the Jersey cases arise from the failure of the trust, as drafted, to
properly exclude the possibility of an adverse tax impact on the settlor and there is as yet no
rule, although it may be a consideration for the Court in its discretion,129 that rectification
cannot be obtained where the sole purpose of seeking rectification is to achieve a legitimate
tax mitigation or advantage which can be proven to have been the parties' true intention
when the document was executed.130 Where a trust falls within the jurisdiction of the Royal
Court,131 the Court may rectify a trust instrument, even if the trust is governed by a foreign
law (in accordance with that foreign law, to be proved as a matter of fact). The Court may
also direct a trustee who brings such an application to submit to the jurisdiction of the
courts whose law governs the trust.132

Intention and Trusts

A. Locus to Apply for Rectification
4-43

Clearly a party with no interest in the outcome has no standing to bring a rectification
application. Having divested himself of the trust property, a settlor has no interest in a rectification claim, unless he is also a beneficiary (or as is often the case in the cases, accidentally
remains as a beneficiary or is deemed to be so). Even where the settlor has no continuing
interest in the trust following settlement, it seems to us unlikely that the settlor would be
deemed to have no standing to seek rectification. The settlor must, in our view, have a right
to ensure that his disposition into trust takes effect as he intended. A beneficiary with a
present interest, whether vested or contingent and however remote, must in our view, have
locus to apply to court to correct a mistake in the terms of the trust instrument by analogy
with the position of such a beneficiary to bring a breach of trust claim.133 By extension,
this must also include a person that may stand to benefit where the trust instrument, as
rectified, will give them an interest that does not presently exist. The real question will be
whether, with the remedy being discretionary, the Court will grant the relief sought. This
will fall to be determined by the evidence and by the position adopted by the settlor and by
those interested in the settlement.

B. Standard of Proof
4-44

A party who seeks rectification of a document must establish with the highest possible
degree of probability that due to a genuine mistake a trust deed does not represent the
intention of the parties.134 The Court will not lightly rectify a settlement, and will be more
easily satisfied if the application is supported by other evidence, such as the settlor's contemporaneous written instructions.135 While there is no requirement in law to do so, it
will be difficult as a matter of evidence to prove the requisite mistake in the absence of
such outward expression of the maker's true intention. It is not sufficient to show that the
settlor did not intend what was recorded; the burden is on the applicant for rectification
to positively prove what was specifically intended.136 However, it is not necessary for him
to have specified the precise form of words to be inserted so long as the evidence shows
with some degree of specificity what was intended.137 Unlike in a dispute where the issue is
the construction of the particular document, the Court may consider the evidence of the
draftsman of the document sought to be rectified, at least in so far as such evidence goes to
the draftsman's mistake in recording the settlor's true intention.138

i. The nature of the Operative Mistake in Rectification Cases after Pitt v Holt
The decision of the UK Supreme Court in the conjoined appeals of Futter v Futter and
Pitt v Holt139 considered the test for mistake as it applies to the remedy of rescission and did
not specifically address the test for mistake as it applies to rectification. The effect of Pitt
v Holt (as it applies to rescission) was to align the test in English law with what was already
accepted to be the accepted test in Jersey.140 Nowhere in Pitt v Holt is it suggested that
rescission and rectification are not to be treated as part of the same principle of equitable
mistake141 and in our view the mistake that is required to be proven to obtain rectification
is essentially the same that needs to be shown to rescind: namely: an operative mistake of
so serious a character as to render it unjust or unconscionable on the part of the donee to
retain the property on the terms of the unrectified document.142

C. Bars to Relief for Rectification and Rescission
As in England, rectification and rescission in Jersey are discretionary remedies. Rectification
will be refused where an instrument, as executed, achieves its purpose even though it does
not achieve some ulterior objective-including a fiscal objective. The Court will not grant
rectification of a document to reflect an intention that did not in fact exist at the time of the
instrument's execution. The Court can rectify a deed which does not reflect the transaction
which the parties intended but the remedy cannot be used to achieve some other transaction which is not supported by a contemporaneous intention but which in hindsight would
have been desirable.143
The Court may refuse to rescind a transaction because of a change of position,144 or on the
grounds of public policy.145 The Court will take into account the effect of the order on third
parties, such as those who have received distributions under a settlement which it is sought
to rescind, and may require undertakings that no claims will be brought against such third
parties.146
A claim to rectification or rescission is not barred by the prescription provisions in
­Article 57 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 but is subject to the equitable doctrine of laches
and so delay and acquiescence may bar a claim for rectification. For laches to act as a bar
to relief there must have been some form of detrimental reliance on the part of the person
relying on the defence, or a relevant third party.147 Since the relief is discretionary the Court

still has scope, for example, to elect against giving relief to a careless mistaken party who
could be said to have assumed the risk of his own mistake.148
A delay between the execution of the document sought to be rectified and the application
to rectify in and of itself, even if of some considerable time, will not usually act as a bar to
relief. It may be the case that the relevant parties agree not to seek rectification of trusts
which will not come into operation, if at all, for many years, but only apply when it becomes
practically necessary to do so, the delay will not be a bar to the remedy because it does not
engage the purpose of the doctrine of laches. The impact of delay is that it may undermine
the quality of the evidence needed to satisfy the high burden of proof on the applicant for
relief that there has been a genuine mistake and the nature of that mistake.149 Trustees who
become aware of an error are under a positive duty to apply timeously to correct it and an
unreasonable delay may result in the Court penalising a trustee in costs.150

D. Practical Considerations in Applications for Rectification, Rescission
and under Articles 47F and 47H of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
4-50

An application to rectify a trust document or to reverse a transaction within the scope of
Article 47B-J is to be brought by way of Representation and is often, so-called, 'friendly'
litigation under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, where none of the relevant parties convened to the proceedings oppose the application. Where the effect of the rectification sought is to reduce the amount of tax payable, or to trigger a claim for a tax refund,
it is the Court's practice to at least notify the relevant tax authority of the proceedings, if
not convene them as a party to the action. There may often be, in the background, a claim
for professional negligence against a lawyer who advised, or failed to advise (as the case
may be) on (usually) the tax consequences of a particular disposition into trust. The Court
will be astute to ensure that justice is achieved in considering an application to which there
is no real opposition, hence the requirement that there be full and frank disclosure of all relevant material as a basis for seeking rectification. The Court will not allow itself to be used
as a mere rubber stamp. Notwithstanding that all parties may agree, it is usually incumbent
upon one of the parties convened, usually the trustee, to act as a devil's advocate and put the
arguments both for and against the remedy sought.151 It is not appropriate for only one representative to be before the Court.152 Advocates are expected to give the Court all the help it
requires to ensure that it has jurisdiction and can properly exercise its discretion in the way
it is asked.153 Thought should be given to which witnesses can be called to give live evidence.

148 Cf Pitt v Holt (n 60) at [114]. Where it is suggested that while a purely unilateral mistake may be sufficient
to found relief it is arguably a good reason for the Court to apply a more stringent test as to the seriousness of the
mistake before granting relief.
149 In The Matter of the C Trust [2008 JLR N20].
150 Re McLean Family Settlement [2002] JRC 152.
151 Provided there is no opposition in fact, we can see no objection to a single firm fielding different advocates
to put forward the argument both for and against the order sought.
152 As in Allnutt v Wilding (n 119), where the claim for rectification failed. Although it is incumbent upon the
applicant for relief to inform court at early stage and seek its approval if it intends not to convene all the beneficiaries; In re R Remuneration Trust 2009 JLR N [40].
153 Southgate v Sutton [2011] EWCA Civ 637.

Rectification and Construction

213

Any doubts as to the existence or genuineness of a mistake may be best resolved by enabling
the Court to hear oral evidence, with or without cross-examination. Where the trustee or its
professional advisors have caused the mistake, the trustee will usually be denied its costs of
the rectification application.154 In practice, very often there will be an agreement behind the
scenes whereby the trustee (or its insurers) will indemnify the other convened parties' costs
of the application.155 The Court will usually order the costs of a trustee who is not responsible for the mistake to take its costs from the fund by way of its usual indemnity but the trustee will be under a duty to consider whether the costs of the application should be recovered
for the benefit of the fund from the person(s) responsible.156 A trustee is usually entitled to
a full indemnity from the trust fund for its reasonable costs of a settlor's successful application to set aside trust for mistake.157 Notwithstanding that many rectification and rescission
claims are conducted on 'friendly terms' under the Court's supervisory jurisdiction, it is not
the practice of the Royal Court to hear a rectification application in private.158 There is no
public interest in protecting professional draftsmen from embarrassment for their mistakes
that would justify the Court sitting in private; indeed, there may be a public interest in in
such errors being made public so that prospective clients might be aware of them and to
ensure professional standards are kept high. The Court may still be persuaded to redact the
identities of a beneficiary, settlor or protector convened to the proceedings.

E. Construction of Trust Documents
Proceedings for the determination of the proper construction of a trust document are
­usually commenced by way of Representation under Article 51(2)(a)(i). Construction disputes can be so-called 'friendly litigation', where (usually the trustee) seeks clarification
from the court on the meaning of the trust instrument, sometimes in conjunction with an
application for directions as to whether it can or should act in accordance with that clarification. However, there are plenty of examples in Jersey case law of highly contentious and
bitterly fought disputes over the true meaning of documents.159 The costs of a construction
dispute are considered elsewhere.160 The Court will usually convene all those with divergent
views and/or all those affected by the disputed construction as parties to the proceedings.

i. Applicable Principles
4-52

Care should be taken to ascertain whether there is in fact any ambiguity in the document
at all.161 If a description, read in its context and in the light of the admissible surrounding
circumstances, points without ambiguity to a single person or thing, there is a strong presumption (though not an absolute rule)162 that that is the person or thing intended, and
the Court will prefer it to another person or thing that corresponds less accurately with the
description given in the document. The Jersey law principles governing the construction
of trust documents will be familiar to those familiar with the applicable principles under
English law. The proper law of a trust will govern the principles to be applied in the construction of the trust instrument.163 The interpretation of documents is a matter of law, not
a matter of fact and therefore can be adjudicated upon by the Bailiff sitting alone without
Jurats.164 The principles to be applied to the construction of trust documents are no different from the approach to be adopted in respect of the construction of other documents:165

the aim is to establish the presumed intention of the maker(s) of the document from
the words used;
words must, however, be construed against the background matrix of the surrounding
facts existing at the time when the document was executed;166
the circumstances that are relevant and admissible for this purpose are those that must
be taken to have been known to the maker at the time or, where there are more than
one, known to the makers of or the parties to the document, and include absolutely
anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document
would have been understood by a reasonable man;167
evidence of subjective intention, earlier drafts and negotiations and other matters
extrinsic to the document in question is inadmissible, as is evidence of events subsequent to the making of the instrument (but not in this jurisdiction, unlike some
others;168
the critical provisions have to be read in the context of the document as a whole;169
words should as far as possible be given their ordinary meaning; and170

161 In Philean Trust Company Limited v Taylor & Ors [2003 JLR 61], the trustees, whilst deferring to the order of
the Court, had taken the view that the fact that the clause under scrutiny could bear 2 interpretations, depending
on how the Court found the law to stand, did not necessarily mean that there was an ambiguity.

principle (6) may have to give way if consideration of the document as a whole, having regard to the principles set out above or common sense, points to a different
conclusion.171

The Royal Court has said that when attempting to discern the true meaning of a power conferred in a trust deed or other instrument the Court must have regard to the nature of the
deed and the purpose for which the power appears to have been granted-though this will
depend to a large extent on the terms of the instrument itself.172 A power of amendment
reserved in a trust must be exercised for the purpose for which it was granted and not for
one beyond the contemplation of the makers of the original instrument.173

4-53

ii. Admissible Evidence in the Interpretation of Trust Documents
The intention that the Court is seeking to elucidate is the intention of the settlor as objectively expressed by the document. The Court will look to ascertain the objective meaning
that the words of the document convey, when considered as a whole in the light of the
surrounding circumstances.174 The document is not to be understood by reference to the
purpose or motive, desire or other subjective intentions or state of mind of the maker of
the document.175 While evidence of the surrounding circumstances as an aid to explain
the objective meaning of a document or the evidence to show what the words mean is
admissible, no evidence of extrinsic circumstances is admissible to add to, contradict, vary
or alter the terms of a deed or other written instrument.176 It is not permissible to adduce
evidence to show that what was in the settlor's head was different from what the document
itself expresses. Drafts of trust documents cannot be referred to in order to interpret the
final version,177 nor can preliminary negotiations or discussions between the settlor and the
draftsman over its terms178 nor are the subjective intentions of the draftsman admissible.179
If the document does not express the settlor's true intention, it may be possible to have
the document rectified to make it accord with the settlor's subjective intentions but that is
a conceptually different process from that which the Court undertakes in a construction

171 Common sense, in this context being reflected by the passage from the speech of Lord Reid in Schuler (L) AG
v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1974] AC at 251 in which he observed: 'The fact that a particular c­ onstruction
leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more
unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall
make that intention abundantly clear'. See also Lord Steyn, again in Society of Lloyd's v Robinson (n 170), and Lord
Hoffmann's observations in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Bldg Socy (n 167) at 913 concerning the need, on occasion, for a court to accept that the parties must have used the wrong words or syntax. But note

dispute.180 In relation to the rectification of wills, the Royal Court has assumed a far more
expansive jurisdiction than that hitherto available under English law.181 The Royal Court
may consult dictionaries for the meanings of ordinary English words.182 It will also consult
Article 1(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984183 and the Interpretation (Jersey) Law 1954 for
legislative terms that are undefined either by the Trusts Law or the trust instrument itself.
The meaning of ordinary words is not strictly evidence of fact as such but dictionaries are
nonetheless admissible on the meaning of words in foreign languages and terms used in a
technical or scientific sense.184
The surrounding circumstances, or 'matrix of fact', can and must be taken into consideration in interpreting a trust document. The matrix of fact cannot be admitted to contradict,
vary or alter the terms of a document and can only be admitted to aid in their application, particularly to identify persons and things referred to in the document itself. Facts
admissible for this purpose must be objective external facts and cannot include direct evidence of the subjective intention of the settlor. The settlor's written instructions may even
be admitted, not as evidence of subjective intention, but as evidence of the state of the
settlor's knowledge.185 Where a word has an ordinary meaning, that ordinary meaning may
be departed from when it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the ordinary
meaning does not accord with the settlor's intention or meaning to be given to a particular
word. Evidence is admissible as part of the matrix of fact, that the maker of a document
habitually used a particular word in a peculiar sense of his own, perhaps as referring to a
particular person or piece of property.186 But the evidence would need to show that the
usage was habitual; evidence that the settlor said when he executed the settlement that by
a particular word in it he meant something other than its natural meaning would not be
admissible. The surrounding circumstances which are relevant are those which exist or
are in the reasonable contemplation of the settlor when the settlement is made. Future or
unforeseen circumstances are inadmissible.187 Evidence of conduct of the parties after the
making of a settlement is not admissible to assist in its interpretation.188 Such evidence is,

[2014] UKSC 2 at [38]-[41] that 'a powerful case for the conclusion that the difference between construction and

as being limited to only legitimate issue (consistently with Jersey succession law and would not be rebutted by
dictionary definitions or everyday usage) if the trust deed had been drafted by lawyer, in the absence of any special
circumstances. But note In Re Erskine Trust, Gregg & Anor v Piggott & Ors [2012] EWHC 732 (Ch) on the impact

however, admissible for the purposes of determining whether or not the settlement or parts
of it are a sham.189
Note that Jersey will allow the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of the testator's intention
to cure an obvious or patent error in a will (which may create a trust) which would, if not
admitted, result in the failure of that part of the will.190 This is a similar jurisdiction to that
provided for in England by section 21 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 in relation
to wills.191

4-56

iii. Tools for Interpreting Patent and Latent Ambiguities
A patent ambiguity in a document is one which is ambiguous on its face-ie a gift to 'one of
my children' or 'a gift of [ ] shares in X Limited' where the settlor may have 100 shares in
X Limited. A latent ambiguity is one which is not apparent from the face of the document,
but which appears when the words of the document subsequently come to be applied to
the circumstances that exist at the time it comes to apply the provision-ie a disposition
of property into trust with a power for the trustee to appoint to one of two people who
have the same name. It is not possible for the trustee to identify which of the two possible alternatives is the true object of their power.192 In English law there is a clear (but
somewhat tenuous) distinction as to whether the court will admit evidence of the settlor's
subjective intention when construing a document that contains a latent, as opposed to a
patent ambiguity. When construing a patent ambiguity, the court will attempt to resolve the
ambiguity by interpreting it having regard to the surrounding matrix of fact (other than
direct evidence of the subjective intention of the settlor). If it is not possible to construe the
ambiguity in this way and the gift or trust is dependent upon a provision containing a patent ambiguity, then it will be void for uncertainty and will fail. The approach in English law
is apparently different where there the ambiguity is latent.193 In such cases it is permissible
to adduce evidence of the settlor's subjective intention and such evidence will be admissible
to assist in construing the latent ambiguity in a document. The distinction between patent
and latent ambiguities has been described as 'highly artificial and capable of producing
results which offend against common sense' and even 'not merely capricious but also …
incoherent'.194 The distinction is a limited one, admitting evidence of the settlor's subjective
intent (contrary to the basic rule that the author of a document's intent is to be gathered
from the document) to save a latent, but not a patent ambiguity. All other surrounding
circumstances are admissible in either case.

Ltd (n 10); Re Esteem Settlement (n 18) (approving Hitch v Stone (n 9).

law of testator's domicile; see In re Estate of Chief Aleyideio [2003 JLR N [7]].
191 However, the more benevolent approach to the construction of documents, esp with regard to the admissibility of extrinsic evidence under French and Roman law as espoused by Pothier (2 Coutumes d'Orleans (1821
edn) para 150 at p 497) and Dalloz (Nouveau Répertoire, 1st edn, Testaments, para 109 and 116 at p 500) was to be
preferred to English authorities.

Intention and Trusts

There is no Jersey authority that specifically provides for the same distinction in respect
of the construction of trust documents subject to a latent ambiguity. However, there is
authority195 that extrinsic evidence of the subjective intentions of the parties is admissible
in relation to the interpretation of both wills and servitudes that are subject to a latent
ambiguity196
The justification commonly deployed for allowing in direct evidence of the settlor's subjective intention in the case of a latent ambiguity is that it prevents the gift from being void.197
In the author's view, given the expectation is anomalous, it is of limited application and
can only be used for the purpose of preventing a gift from failing and is not of general
application.
It might be argued that if the settlor's subjective intention were capable of preventing a patent ambiguity from making a gift void the distinction between latent and patent ambiguities is somewhat arbitrary and the settlor's subjective intention should also be admissible.
However, the distinction turns on different purposes for which the settlor's subjective intent
is admitted into evidence. In the case of a latent ambiguity, the person or thing referred to
is completely and correctly described, though it turns out that the description in the document applies just as equally to another person or thing. The admissibility of evidence of the
settlor's subjective intent does not add to, contradict or vary the terms of the settlement.
In contrast, in a case of a patent ambiguity, the settlement does not accurately express the
settlor's intentions and the evidence is wanted in order to alter (ie rewrite) the expression
given to them.

197 In re Double Happiness Trust [2002 JLR N [48]], it was said that the Court will endeavour to uphold the
validity of a trust by interpreting it, as far as possible, to give effect to the intention of the settlor and it will reluctantly be compelled to allow the trust to fail if the subject matter, beneficial interests or beneficiaries are uncertain,
or the trust deed is incoherent.

Disclosure of Trust Information
and Documents
I. Introduction
The first part of this chapter is concerned with the disclosure of information and documents pertaining to a trust and the rights of trustees and beneficiaries to such material
under Jersey trust law to:
1.

5-1

be given, without demand, information about the existence of a trust and their interest
under it;
seek from trustees, on demand, access to trust accounts, information about the trust,
the trust property and documents relating to the trust;
the disclosure obligations of an outgoing trustee to its successor(s); and
the disclosure obligations of a trustee to other persons that are connected to the trust,
other than a beneficiary, such as a protector, power holder or the settlor.

The second part of this chapter is concerned with an array of legislative and procedural
regimes, not based upon Jersey trust law, for the disclosure of documents and information
pertaining to a trust in the context of:
1.
2.
3.

5-2

hostile litigation before the Royal Court;
the obtaining of evidence in Jersey for use in civil proceedings outside of the island; and
a notice having been issued by Jersey's Comptroller of Taxes to a trustee to provide
relevant 'tax information' under Jersey's Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA)
regime.

II. The Voluntary Provision of Trust Information to
Beneficiaries
In many instances, a trustee is concerned less with what they must disclose to the ­beneficiary1
and more with what they may disclose. The tension that exists in any request for disclosure

Disclosure of Information and Documents

of information is a triangulation, between: maintaining the confidence of the beneficiaries that the trustee is accountable to them; the trustee's duty of confidentiality to and as
between beneficiaries; and, thirdly, the value the trustee may ascribe to maintaining a 'safe
space' in which it is free to exercise its discretion without constant surveillance and interference from beneficiaries.
The beneficiaries' requests for disclosure information and documents about the trust from
the trustee may be enforced by way of legal proceedings. Such proceedings are usually commenced by way of Representation, but the 'entitlement'2 that is sought to be vindicated by
such proceedings is that which arises under trust law and can be contrasted with the process
of formal discovery which is a procedural requirement of litigation before the Royal Court3
that is ancillary to the vindication of the beneficiaries' rights against the trustee for disclosure of trust information.

A. Voluntary Disclosure
5-5

There is a narrow range of instances in which, absent special circumstances, it is usually
unnecessary (and unreasonable)4 for the trustee to seek directions from the Court as to
whether it should give disclosure of information and documents to the beneficiary. A trustee is obliged to inform the adult beneficiaries5 who attain a vested interest in possession
of their interest.6 We consider that generally similar considerations apply to discretionary
beneficiaries and objects of discretionary trusts or fiduciary powers. There is no requirement to disclose the existence of a settlement to all objects of fiduciary powers (which could
be a very wide class) in all circumstances.7 The trustee must identify those discretionary
beneficiaries who are, in the circumstances, real potential candidates for benefiting from
the proper exercise of the trustee's discretion under the trust or power; and disclosure may,
indeed normally should, be limited to those discretionary beneficiaries.8 Where trustees
have a duty of disclosure without demand under the principles set out above, the information that needs to be given is the existence of the settlement and the beneficiary's interest
under it. Unless it is self-apparent from the trustees' communication, sufficient information

2 As will be seen, strictly the beneficiaries have no such unassailable entitlement to trust documents from the
trustee; see Rabaiotti 1989 Settlement [2000 JLR 173]; Schmidt v Rosewood [2003] UKPC 26 and the vindication
of a beneficiary's claim for information and documents as an aspect of its inherent supervisory jurisdiction in the
administration of a trust.

4 With the attendant consequence that the Court may deny the trustee its costs of such an application or may
order indemnity costs against it if other parties are put to the expense of arguing the matter.
5 The duty of voluntary disclosure to a beneficiary has been held, in England, to arise when the beneficiary
reaches majority, see Hawkesley v May [1956] 1 QB 304, although it does not follow that there need never be
disclosure without demand in relation to interests of minor beneficiaries and the fact that a beneficiary is a minor
does not mean that the trustees are unaccountable to him. A minor is able to enforce the accountability of the
trustees in proceedings commenced in his name with a guardian ad litem acting on his behalf, who will normally
be the minor's parent. See RCR 2004, r 4/2.
6 Hawkesley v May (n 5); in Foreman v Kingstone [2005] WTLR 823 at [85], NZ HC, the duty to inform beneficiaries of their rights was described as 'fundamental'.

Disclosure to Beneficiaries on Demand

about the identity of the trustees should also be provided to enable the beneficiary to seek
further information from the trustees on demand. However, we do not consider that the
trustee has to provide the beneficiary with copies of any accounts or trust documents without demand. If the beneficiary wants further information or access to accounts or trust
documents it is up to the beneficiary to seek them from the trustee.
The trustee should also take reasonable steps to inform an adult beneficiary even if the
beneficiary's interest is not vested in possession: being either vested in interest or a future
vested yet defeasible or contingent interest, and the general nature of that interest, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the interest comes into existence. This is unless the trustee
reasonably believes that by reason of the remoteness of the interest the beneficiary has no
reasonable prospect of successfully asserting rights to information on demand, or there are
other special circumstances (not merely the wish of the settlor to keep the existence of the
settlement a secret) justifying a delay in disclosure.
The trustee's failure to inform the beneficiary of the existence of a settlement and his interest under it is not likely to result in a loss so as to amount to an actionable breach of trust.9
Where the trustee fails to pay a fund to a beneficiary who has become absolutely entitled,
and fails to inform him of the existence of his interest, they may be charged with compound
interest.10 A trustee exemption clause may afford a defence to a personal claim by the beneficiary, and the trustee may also seek relief under Article 45 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law if the
trustee has acted honestly, reasonably and ought fairly to be excused.11 A prolonged failure
to comply with the duty to disclose the existence of the settlement could conceivably support a case for a loss of trust and confidence in the trustee, incompetent administration of
the trust or an irreparable breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and beneficiaries so as to afford grounds for the trustee's removal.
While the trustee will find it difficult to justify its refusal to disclose the existence of a trust
and the beneficiaries' interest under it, it is inaccurate, for the reasons set out below, to
describe the beneficiaries' legitimate expectation to information of this nature as being in
the nature of a right.12

III. Disclosure by Trustees to Beneficiaries on Demand
The vast majority of the reported Royal Court decisions in this area are not concerned with
the innocuous disclosure of the existence of a trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.
Beneficiaries may demand from a trustee disclosure of information concerning the trust in
a variety of other contexts, not all of which may give rise to concern for the trustee but the
following contexts are likely to be familiar to practitioners:
1.

A beneficiary (or a successor trustee on their behalf) may seek information from a
trustee (or former trustee) because the beneficiaries may be disgruntled with the way

Disclosure of Information and Documents
in which the trustee has administered the trust and its assets. The demand for information may be a precursor to a hostile claim for malfeasance against the trustee. The
request or demand for information may be a genuine inquiry or little more than a fishing expedition, the purpose of which is to enable the beneficiary to ascertain whether
there are grounds for a claim for breach of trust, or perhaps a claim that the trustee has
made some unauthorised profit from the trust, or charged excessive fees.
Very many Jersey trusts are discretionary, in which the beneficiaries have no vested
interest in the trust assets and benefits are conferred by the exercise of discretionary
powers vested in the trustee or (sometimes in conjunction) with some other power
holder. A beneficiary may be disappointed with the way in which powers or discretions conferred by the trust have been exercised so as to benefit one beneficiary (or
group of beneficiaries) over another. The demand for information may be against the
background of a family dispute. While the trustee may not, at first, be the target of the
beneficiaries' dissatisfaction (the real dispute may be between the warring beneficiaries) it will invariably be the trustee from whom information is demanded, again for the
purpose of finding out whether there is ammunition to mount an attack on the exercise of the power exercised by the trustee. If the trustee has exercised (usually but not
exclusively) a dispositive power to benefit one beneficiary over another, the trustee's
decision-making process in the exercise of that power will come under scrutiny and the
trustee may be at risk of a personal claim for breach of trust if the trustee has parted
with assets pursuant to the exercise of the power that may later be found to have been
exercised improperly or defectively.
An alternative scenario is that of an attack upon the trust by a beneficiary, perhaps
under an entitlement to assets settled into trust contrary to forced heirship rights or
by way of matrimonial proceedings in a jurisdiction other than Jersey. The trustee may
be caught on the horns of a dilemma; in being obliging and providing information to
the beneficiary it may be providing the beneficiary with grounds to criticise the trustee
which will not be used just against the trustee, but potentially against the trust or the
trust assets.

Other than for those categories of documents that the trustee cannot reasonably refuse to
provide to a beneficiary, the trustee may find itself in a difficult situation. A trustee faced
with demands for information in circumstances such as those mentioned above are often
advised, where they have real concerns that disclosure will be detrimental to the interests
of the beneficiaries as a whole, or there is real doubt whether disclosure should be made,
to seek the Royal Court's authoritative direction as to what should be disclosed and to
minimise the risk for them of an adverse costs order with which they may be faced if they
pursue a policy of disclosing little or nothing, leaving the beneficiaries to seek redress from
the Court in hostile proceedings. If trustees adopt this course, they should normally be prepared to accept the Court's ruling and not seek to challenge it on appeal.13

13 Or do so at their own risk as to costs. In the matter of the R and RA Trusts (Guernsey CA) 25/2014 approving
the dissenting judgment of Salmon LJ in Londonderry Settlement [1965] Ch 918 at 936: 'the trustees were fully justified in bringing this appeal. Indeed it was their duty to bring it since they believe rightly that an appeal is essential
for the protection of the general body of beneficiaries'.

Disclosure to Beneficiaries on Demand

223

A. Applicable Principles
Jersey's rules governing the disclosure of information under a trust are derived from both
statute14 and case law. Jersey law has long recognised that the disclosure of trust information
and documents is subject to an overriding judicial discretion and not hard-and-fast rules
as to the beneficiaries' unassailable right or entitlement to documents or i­nformation.15
This discretion forms part of the Court's overriding supervisory jurisdiction in relation
to trusts and enables the Court to intervene, where necessary, in the administration of a
trust to protect the trust from an attempt by beneficiaries to exploit a technical entitlement
to information about the trust that may be contrary to the interests of the trust and the
­beneficial class as a whole.
The customary law rules are supplemented by Article 29 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
which provides:

5-11

5-12

29 Trustee may refuse to make disclosure
Subject to the terms of the trust and subject to any order of the court, a trustee shall not be required
to disclose to any person, any document which -
(a)

discloses the trustee's deliberations as to the manner in which the trustee has exercised a
power or discretion or performed a duty conferred or imposed upon him or her;
(b) discloses the reason for any particular exercise of such power or discretion or performance of
duty or the material upon which such reason shall or might have been based;
(c) relates to the exercise or proposed exercise of such power or discretion or the performance or
proposed performance of such duty; or
(d) relates to or forms part of the accounts of the trust,
unless, in a case to which sub-paragraph (d) applies, that person is a beneficiary under the trust not
being a charity, or a charity which is referred to by name in the terms of the trust as a beneficiary
under the trust or the enforcer in relation to any non-charitable purposes of the trust.

This is one of the more awkwardly worded provisions of the Trusts Law, being phrased in
the negative. Article 29 does not state what the trustee must disclose but instead states what
a trustee is entitled to withhold, subject to the double negative in relation to the accounts
of the trust in Article 29(d). It is tolerably clear that when taken in conjunction with the
prevailing themes in the case law, the following principles can be derived:
1.

The trustee may disclose whatever information it considers appropriate to
­beneficiaries.16 Article 29 provides only that the trustee is not required to disclose trust
documents and information to a beneficiary.17

14

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 29.
The leading Jersey case on the disclosure of trust information by trustees is Rabaiotti 1989 Settlement (n 2);
the approach adopted was later endorsed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the leading English
decision of Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd (n 2), affirmed in Jersey by Re Internine Trust [2004 JLR 325]. See also In
re C.A. Settlement [2002 JLR 312]; J.P. Morgan Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd v Alhamrani 2007 JLR N [26]; In re B Settlement
[2011 JLR 236]; In re Bird Charitable Trust [2012 (1) JLR 62].

property held on trust may be exercised, thereby encompassing both discretionary fixed interest beneficiaries; see

Disclosure of Information and Documents
The double negative in Article 29 positively requires the trustee to disclose to a beneficiary, or a named charitable beneficiary, or an enforcer of a private purpose trust, any
document which relates to or forms part of the accounts of the trust.
The trustee is subject to a general duty to preserve the confidentiality of the trust's
affairs from outsiders to the trust.18
The Court has discretion to override any decision of the trustee to disclose or not to
disclose information or documents about the trust to any person including the scope
of such disclosure, whether the documents should be disclosed in a complete or in a
redacted form and what safeguards it should impose19 to limit the use which may be
made of documents or information disclosed under the order of the Court.20

In determining whether, what and how disclosure should be made to a beneficiary under
the above principles, it is the author's view that the court is exercising its own discretion
in supervising, and intervening in, the administration of trusts. The Court's function is
not limited simply to reviewing the trustee's exercise of its own discretion and giving its
blessing so as to limit its jurisdiction to order or restrict disclosure only to cases where it
is proved that the trustee's decision or proposed decision on disclosure is of a kind that no
reasonable trustee could reach.21 That said, the decision whether, what and how disclosure
should be made to a beneficiary, in the first instance, is the trustee's decision and will usually stand in the absence of a successful challenge to the decision or successful invocation of
the supervisory jurisdiction. The Court has a concurrent inherent and statutory jurisdiction to intervene in the administration of the trust but will only do so on a sensible and
principled basis.22
The States of Jersey is currently consulting on a seventh amendment to the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984 which would radically overhaul Article 29 and could potentially replace it with
a new provision modelled on the equivalent statutory provision in Guernsey, section 26 of
the Trusts (Guernsey) Law 2007, which provides:
26 Duty to give information
(1) A trustee shall, at all reasonable times, at the written request of (a) any enforcer, or
(b) subject to the terms of the trust (i)
any beneficiary (including any charity named in the trust),
(ii) the settlor, or
(iii) any trust official,
provide full and accurate information as to the state and amount of the trust property.

(35/2012) Guernsey CA recognising the exceptions in Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England
[1924] 1 KB 46: (1) where disclosure is under compulsion by law; (2) where there is a duty to the public to disclose;
(3) where the interests of the bank [read trustee] require disclosure and (4) where the disclosure is made by the
express or implied consent of the customer.

Disclosure to Beneficiaries on Demand

225

(2) Where the terms of the trust prohibit or restrict the provision of any information described in
subsection (1), a trustee, beneficiary, trust official or settlor may apply to the Royal Court for an
order authorising or requiring the provision of the information.
(3) The person applying to the Royal Court for an order under subsection (2) must show that the
provision of the information is necessary or expedient-
(a) for the proper disposal of any matter before the court,
(b) for the protection of the interests of any beneficiary, or
(c) for the proper administration or enforcement of the trust.

This provision is to be read alongside section 38 of the 2007 Law which provides:

5-16

38 Non-disclosure of deliberations or letters of wishes
(1) A trustee is not, subject to the terms of the trust and to any order of the Royal Court, obliged
to disclose -
(a)

documents which reveal -
(i)
his deliberations as to how he should exercise his functions as trustee,
(ii) the reasons for any decision made in the exercise of those functions,
(iii) any material upon which such a decision was or might have been based,

(b) any letter of wishes
(2) A 'letter of wishes' is a letter or other document intimating how the settlor or beneficiary wishes
the trustees to exercise any of their functions.
(3) The person applying to the Royal Court for an order under this section for the disclosure of any
document must show that the disclosure is necessary or expedient -
(a) for the proper disposal of any matter before the court,
(b) for the protection of the interests of any beneficiary, or
(c) for the proper administration or enforcement of the trust.

As will be immediately obvious from a summary comparison of the above provisions with
Article 29, the Guernsey provisions are a much clearer expression of the actual position
under Jersey law; that the beneficiary's right to certain information is subject to the terms of
the trust and to the orders of the Court and can be restricted within the limits of the principle of accountability. The beneficiary may apply to the Court for directions where necessary.

5-17

B. Categories of Trust Documents for Which Disclosure Is Often Sought
While the Court retains an overriding discretion as to whether, what and how disclosure is
made to beneficiaries in relation to any document, not all documents that are capable of
being disclosed have an equal weighting in terms of the Court's likelihood of ordering or
refusing their disclosure. Certain documents are well within the established bounds of what
is readily disclosable and carry, in the absence of good reasons to the contrary, a strong presumption of disclosure while other documents fall into a more peripheral sphere in which
the trustee's decision to refuse disclosure is likely to be given greater latitude. In ascending
order, documents that carry a presumption in favour of disclosure are:
a)

Category 1-Those documents clearly falling within squarely within Article 29(d) as
documents relating to or forming part of the accounts of the trust; without more.

5-18

226
b)
c)

Disclosure of Information and Documents
Category 2-Those documents falling within Article 29(a)-(c) which may or do evidence the reasons for which a trustee has exercised their discretion in a particular way.
Category 3-Those documents falling within Article 29 but not within Category 2
above, where the interests of the beneficiary seeking disclosure are in conflict with
those of other beneficiaries.

i. Category 1
5-19

The following categories of documents fall within category 1.
a. Trust Accounts

5-20

5-21

5-22

A trustee must keep clear and distinct accounts of the property he administers, and to
be constantly ready with his accounts.23 It is trite law that a beneficiary is entitled to seek
inspection and copies of trust accounts and prima facie the trust accounts should be disclosed to all beneficiaries on demand.24 While such an entitlement is not absolute and is
always subject to the discretion of the Court to order otherwise,25 in ordinary cases the discretion is heavily weighted in favour of allowing disclosure of trust accounts to a beneficiary
on demand because the Court will always seek to give effect to the trustee's fundamental
duty of accountability to the beneficiary.26
The only reasons why disclosure of the trust accounts will be excluded or made be subject to
restrictions or redaction are either that the beneficiary has an interest which is too remote
to warrant disclosure in his favour, or that there is a real and substantiated concern that the
information disclosed by the accounts will be used by the beneficiary to harm the interests
of the beneficiaries as a whole.27 Where a beneficiary persists in seeking to challenge the
trust in foreign proceedings, the Court may withhold disclosure even of the trust accounts
so long as that challenge exists.28
A beneficiary who has a future interest only in capital will struggle to justify why the trustee
should disclose accounts showing the flow of income. Such accounts are not necessary for
him to vindicate his interest, having no interest in the income position of the trust. The

23 West v Lazard Brothers (Jersey) Limited [1987-88 JLR 414] defined 'any document which relates to or forms
part of the accounts of the trust' very widely to include 'all accounts, vouchers, coupons, documents and correspondence relation to the administration of the trust property or otherwise to the execution of the trust, including
a full inventory of the trust assets and all dealing relation to any real property (as defined in Re Londonderry's
Settlement [1965] Ch 918' although the scope of the term does not seem to have been argued. However, In Re
A Settlement [1994 JLR 139] it was held that Art 29(d) is not to be construed so widely as to render the protection
of the trustees' confidentiality contained in Art 29(a)-(c) nugatory. We consider 'accounts' to include the accounts
of any underlying companies held by the trust; see In re Lombardo Settlement [2000 JLR N-67], which defined
'accounts' to be given a common sense interpretation, using normal standards of trust and accountancy practice.

27 However, even in such cases there is a still a strong presumption in favour of disclosure, esp where any
concerns can be adequately met by appropriate confidentiality undertakings restricting the disclosure of trust
accounts to third parties or their use in other proceedings; see Re Rabaiotti's Settlements (n 2).

same rationale may not be as applicable for income only beneficiaries who will usually
be entitled to an account of how their income has been generated. Different beneficiaries of distinct sub-funds within the same overarching trust structure are not usually entitled to seek accounts for the other sub-funds, unless this is justified in order to establish,
for example, whether expenses or tax liabilities have been allocated across the sub-funds
appropriately.
A trustee should provide the beneficiaries, on request, with an inventory of trust assets (and
any title documents), inform the beneficiaries of the trust's investments, their performance
and any liabilities, security interests or other charges against the assets. A beneficiary may
also seek reasonable information and supporting documents about transactions concerning the trust assets and held by companies owned by the trust entered into by or with the
authority of the trustees. A beneficiary is normally entitled to inspect trustees' receipts for
their expenditure. While the trustees must give accurate information, they need not answer
never-ending lengthy and voluminous enquiries as to the state of the trust beyond what is
reasonable having regard to the trustee's time and resources available to respond to such
inquiries.29 Where a beneficiary's requests for information require the trustee to incur additional time costs the Court is entitled to take the beneficiary's conduct into account if a
dispute arises concerning the additional fees that may be incurred.30
The accounts to which a discretionary beneficiary is entitled includes a record of all distributions of income and/or capital and the identity of the recipient.31 Such a breakdown
is, by analogy with trust instruments that record the exercise of dispositive powers, necessary so as to enable the beneficiary making the request for disclosure to hold the trustee to
account that the trust monies are all properly accounted for and put at the disposal of those
entitled to benefit under the trust.32 The authors also consider that the beneficiary will be
entitled to copies of the written resolutions of the trustee at which it resolved to make distributions, to show the fact of the making of the distribution, as distinct from the reasons
for the distribution33 provided it is possible to disclose those resolutions (whether or not in
a redacted form) without disclosing the reasons or materials upon which it is based.

b. Trust Documents
There is little doubt that the Court, if called upon, would exercise its discretion to order
disclosure of the trust instrument to a beneficiary.34 The same approach will likely be taken
to other supplementary trust instruments35 such as instruments of addition of property,
instruments exercising powers, instruments of appointment and retirement of trustees,36

instruments of indemnity in favour of outgoing or former trustees,37 instruments of
appointment or advancement that evidence the exercise of dispositive powers,38 instruments varying the terms of the trust, instruments restricting, releasing or enlarging the
powers of the trustee (or other power holder) and instruments that add or exclude objects
from the beneficial class.39 A trustee is not normally to be required to disclose drafts or
unexecuted versions of trust instruments since they have no effect.40 A beneficiary of
one trust cannot usually seek disclosure of the trust instruments of another trust even if
both trusts have the same trustee. The beneficiary is a stranger to the second trust to which
the trustee owes a duty of confidence.41 If the requesting beneficiary is a beneficiary of both
trusts he should seek disclosure in his capacity as beneficiary. If the beneficiary suspects
that his trustee is also trustee of another settlement under which the beneficiary may also
be interested, a trustee is generally bound to disclose the existence of a settlement to a beneficiary as trustee of the other settlement.42 While the core trust documents are well within
the scope of documents that are readily disclosable upon the beneficiary's request, there is
scope for the trustee to exercise a discretion as to the mode and extent of the disclosure.
A sensible trustee will usually comply with any reasonable request by a beneficiary to see
the core trust documents, even if, following Schmidt v Rosewood, there is strictly no legal
entitlement to them, as the relationship of trust should be based on mutual trust.43 It is
not necessary, in an age where documents are often held digitally, for the trustee to provide
hard copies of the core trust documents. Nor is he generally required to produce the 'wet
ink' originals.44 Nor is the trustee required, without being satisfied as to the explanation
or purpose for which they are sought, to provide certified copies of the documents. Trust
documents are usually provided on the beneficiary's express undertaking that they are to
remain confidential. Where there is a substantiated concern that an undertaking will not
sufficiently protect the interests of other beneficiaries in keeping the document confidential
then the trustee may be able to insist on professional inspection only or inspection without
the provision of copies.45
Where a trust instrument constitutes different trusts for different beneficiaries in respect
of distinct parts of or shares in the fund, there may well be a good case for disclosure of
redacted copies of the trust instrument, omitting parts of the trust instrument relating
solely to the parts or shares in the trust fund held on trusts for beneficiaries other than the
beneficiary seeking disclosure. However, a reasonable and proper comprehension of a beneficiary's interest or rights under a series of provisions generally requires knowledge of the
trusts and powers as a whole, of which the beneficiary's interest or rights form part.

the Court.

Disclosure to Beneficiaries on Demand

229

Where an instrument effects an appointment to a beneficiary under a fiduciary or special
power, the trustee should be mindful that it owes duties to objects of such a power, and
every beneficiary who is a potential object of such a power has a legitimate interest in seeking access to an instrument exercising such a power, regardless of whether he benefits from
it. The rationale for this proposition is that the beneficiary is entitled to be satisfied that the
trustee's duties owed to him have been performed. Beneficiaries can object to the redaction
of the identity of the object of the trustee's discretion on the basis that, without identification of the other beneficiaries, the beneficiary seeking disclosure is unable to assess whether
any appointment or advancement under the trust otherwise than in favour or for the benefit of himself is made within the scope of the trust.
The settlor's wishes recorded either in the recitals to a trust instrument or in the main body
of the document do not have the same presumption of confidentiality as a settlor's letter of
wishes and there are no proper grounds to insist upon their redaction before disclosure.46
Redaction may be appropriate in some circumstances.47 It is reasonable for the trustees
to inquire why disclosure is being sought of parts of the trust instruments under which
the beneficiary seeking disclosure cannot benefit. The beneficiary may have a good reason
which, if they are to be persuasive, needs to be supported by reference to how knowledge of
the other provisions of the trust instruments affect his interest.

c. Information about Trust Charges, Fees and Remuneration
A beneficiary is entitled to seek detailed breakdown and supporting documents in relation
to fees and expenses of the trustees,48 including fees and expenses charged to companies
owned by the trust that is sufficient to enable the beneficiary to form a reasonably informed
view of whether they are reasonable.49 The Court may order the production of documents
by a trustee to enable beneficiaries to decide whether to challenge trustees' fees.50 A trustee
is required, both under the general trust law principles, and under the Codes of Practice
issued to regulated trust companies by the Jersey Financial Services Commission to be open
and transparent about its fees and charges.51

power or discretion to beneficiaries.53 This is the so-called Re Londonderry54 exception
upon which the formulation in Article 29(a)-(c) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 and section 38 of the Trusts (Guernsey) Law 2007 is based. The settled position in Jersey is that
there is a prima facie presumption (and we put it no higher than that)55 that the Court will
not exercise its discretion to order disclosure of documents to beneficiaries that show, in
whole or in part, the reasons for the exercise of powers by trustees if the trustees do not wish
to disclose those documents. However, the trustee's entitlement to withhold documents
falling within Article 29(a)-(c) is not absolute and the presumption against disclosure will
yield to a court order to the contrary if the Court deems such disclosure to be in the best
interests of the beneficiaries as a whole.56 Just as beneficiaries have no absolute right to disclosure of certain documents from the trustee, the trustee has no absolute right to withhold
certain document from the beneficiary.
Most of the Jersey cases on the scope of the Re Londonderry exception concern 'material
upon which such reasons were or might have been based'. It is, at first sight, odd to except
from disclosure documents which might have formed the basis for the trustee's reasons for
a particular decision given the principle that disclosure to the beneficiaries is a necessary
part and parcel of being able to properly hold the trustee to account.
The rationale for the Re Londonderry exception is to protect the autonomy of the trustee's
decision-making process. In our view, material within Article 29(b) would include material held by the trustee concerning the personal circumstances of the beneficiaries who are
objects of the trustee's discretionary dispositive powers. Outwith the 'material upon which
such reasons were or might have been based' are likely a summary of the current state of
the trust fund or statements as to past distributions, valuations of trust assets, investment
policy guidelines,57 generic investment or asset management advice.58
On one view there is little to commend there being a strong presumption against disclosure
of material upon which such reasons were or might have been based. The material is one
step removed from the issue the beneficiaries are actually concerned about as it contains
neither the reasons for the decision reached nor the deliberations of the trustees. At most,
the material upon which the reasons might be based is no more that material from which it
might be inferred that the decision was based. There remains the possibility that the material disclosed might not in fact have been the material upon which a particular decision was
based. A situation that well show the subordinate importance of the material upon which
reasons may or may not be based is where the trustee volunteered its reasons but refused
to disclose the material upon which it is based. In those circumstances, the Court is more

55 Art 29(a)-(c) is phrased in terms of a prima facie entitlement to withhold information and documents falling within those provisions. It follows that prima facie, the Court should not displace that entitlement unless it is
satisfied that such entitlement cannot be justified by reference to the reasons for which such an entitlement exists.

likely, absence a cogent explanation to the contrary, to order the disclosure of the material
upon which the stated reasons are based.59 Within Articles 29(a)-(c) are:
Internal Trust Correspondence and Records
Re Londonderry established a general prima facie exception to the presumption of ­disclosure60
of certain correspondence and other documents, internal to the trust, that are created in
the course of its administration.61 Correspondence extends to any means of written or electronic communication. It appears from the authorities that the rationale for protecting
certain correspondence from disclosure is to protect the confidentiality in the documents
and to avoid the potential for rancour (that appears to have been assumed to have been
inevitable) disrupting the smooth administration of the trust were the documents to be
disclosure.62 Even taking the potential for rancour at its highest, in the author's view there
is no sound basis why communications that concern administrative matters only, rather
than going to the exercise of dispositive powers of the trustees, should attract the same
presumption of confidentiality.63 Neither does there seem to be a sound basis to justify why
a beneficiary cannot obtain disclosure of correspondence between himself and the trustee,
distinct from correspondence between the trustee and other beneficiaries, which will usually remain confidential.64 Notwithstanding these reservations as to the scope of the principle that justifies the presumption against disclosure (which owes as much to practicality
as it does to principle) it must be remembered that the Re Londonderry exemption is only a
presumption which can yield if the circumstances of individual cases demand it.

5-36

Letters and Memoranda of Wishes
It is well established that a letter of wishes65 to the trustee is a relevant consideration66 in
relation to the exercise of the trustee's powers and discretions.67 The fact that a trustee takes
into account a letter of wishes (or follows it closely, if not slavishly) in and of itself does

trustee's considered.
60 Which is again subject to any contrary order of the Court, although it appears that the exception of these
documents is not justified on the basis of the documents containing or evidencing reasons for the decisions of
the trustee.
61 See the order which excepts: correspondence passing between the trustees, beneficiaries and 'appointors',
agendas of meetings of the trustee (to the extent that they contain the reasons for a decision or material upon
which such reasons could have been based), correspondence passing between the trustees, if more than one (and
by extension between those making decisions for the trustee), between the trustees and protector, if any, and
between the trustee(s), protector(s) and the beneficiaries.
62 See J.P. Morgan Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd v Alhamrani (n 15); Re The Avalon Trust (n 35); Schmidt v Rosewood
(n 2) at 49. In Londonderry's Settlements (n 13) at 935-36 above, Danckwerts LJ put it as high as suggesting it would
be 'impossible' to execute the trusts if such disclosure was ordered.
63 Correspondence between a beneficiary and a trustee requesting an update from the trustees as to the current
net asset value of the trust assets is clearly qualitatively different (and far closer to material that would normally be
readily disclosable) from a begging letter asking for and setting out a case for a distribution.

Disclosure of Information and Documents

not show that the trustee has done anything wrong nor does it put the validity of the trust
into question.68 However, disclosure of the settlor's letter of wishes is often sought (with the
importance of disclosure having gained a particular prominence in divorce cases) because,
it is often thought, that it will unlock (or provide the basis upon which the Court can draw
an inference as to) the true basis upon which the trust is run and will be an accurate indicator as to the trustee's past decision-making or a predictor as to future decision-making. The
importance of the settlor's letter of wishes to the trustee's decision-making process may be
overstated. Inevitably, the circumstances in which a letter of wishes will have weight and
applicability to the trustee's decision-making will vary from case to case. Even if followed
closely by the trustee, a letter of wishes is of a fundamentally different character to the
constitutive core trust documents, which are readily disclosable to the beneficiaries. The
trust documents are the terms upon which the trust operates and the source of the trustee's
powers and discretions. A letter of wishes can only take effect within the bounds created by
the constitutive documents and exists in furtherance of the trustee's powers and discretions
(and restrictions) created by those documents. A trustee is not generally obliged to disclose
a letter of wishes and may keep it confidential from the beneficiaries unless the Court considers there is a good reason in favour of disclosure.69 The Court's reluctance to order the
disclosure of the letter of wishes has been the consistent trend in the Jersey authorities.70
That reluctance is based upon the presumption that a letter of wishes is confidential as
between its maker and the trustee71 and, like the presumption that applies to correspondence discussed above, falls squarely within the Londonderry category 3 exception from
disclosure.72 The defining characteristic of a letter of wishes is that by its nature it contains
(or is likely to contain) material which its maker wishes the trustee to take into account in
exercising its powers and having been having been brought into existence for that purpose,
it is protected from disclosure by the same presumption of secrecy that attaches to the trustee's decision-making process, the reasons for decisions and the material upon which such
reasons are or may be based. A letter of wishes will normally only ordered to be disclosed
if the Court considers disclosure to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries as a whole
and will further the sound administration of the trust. Indeed one of the reasons for the
presumption against disclosure is an assumption that the smooth administration of the
trust is likely to be disrupted were there to be disclosure. Generally disclosure is not usually dependent upon the context in which the beneficiaries' demand arises or the reasons
behind it (eg dissatisfaction with a particular decision of the trustee or divorce proceedings). However, where disclosure is sought for the purposes of evaluating the beneficiary's
prospects in the context of an application for ancillary relief, disclosure of the letter of
wishes may well be ordered for the following reasons:73

68 Re Esteem Settlement [2003] JRC 092 at [162]-[167] and at [218]. A document describing itself as a letter
of wishes was deemed to be effective to vary a trust under the rule in Saunders v Vautier if signed by all the adult,

to forestall a foreign court from drawing an adverse inference from non-disclosure;
to ensure the foreign court does not come to an inaccurate conclusion as to the beneficiaries' expectation of benefit in the absence of evidence to the contrary; or
to ensure a foreign court does not make a more burdensome ancillary relief order
against a beneficiary than it might otherwise have done.

The unifying theme is to ensure the Court does not have a false impression as to the
resources available to one party to the divorce proceedings such as that a husband stands
to substantially benefit from a trust where, upon reading the letter of wishes, the husband
has a remote chance of benefit and the children of the marriage are the 'real' beneficiaries.

5-38

While great weight is given to the principle that a letter or wishes is intended and is often
expressed by the settlor to be confidential and not to be disclosed to the beneficiaries, we
doubt whether the Court would, simply by reason of that fact, be prohibited from ordering
the disclosure of a letter of wishes.74 Very often such stipulations of confidentiality are not
expressed to be absolute but will be expressed as the letter having been given to the trustee
to be used and referred to in accordance with their best judgment and discretion. Stipulations of confidentiality are often expressed in such a cautious way so as to preclude the suggestion, by anyone who might obtain a copy and seek to challenge the trust, that the settlor
has fettered the trustee's discretion or has any measure of control over the trustee. It follows
that any relaxation of the confidence in which the letter is held by the trustees is a matter
for the trustee's (and ultimately the Court's) discretion.
It follows that the confidence in a letter of wishes given to trustees may be asymmetric in
that the trustee may be able to insist on the confidentiality of the letter as against the settlor
(if the settlor wished to disclose it to the beneficiaries but the trustees did not) but the
settlor would not necessarily be able to restrain the trustee from doing the same.
The better view is that the confidentiality that is afforded to a letter of wishes exists, not
for the benefit of the settlor, who after constituting the trust may75 depart the scene and
to whom the trustee owes no duty, but for the benefit of the sound administration of the
trust as a whole. Where the sound administration of the trust in issue, the Court will usually order the disclosure of a letter of wishes if it is in the interests of the beneficiaries as a
whole to do and can be expected to support the trustee's position of withholding it where
it would not be so beneficial.
The Court retains a discretion as to the manner in which a letter of wishes is disclosed. An
order for disclosure of a letter wishes is usually subject to undertakings that it will remain
confidential in the hands of the beneficiary to whom it is disclosed and used only for the
limited purpose for which it is sought.76 Where there is a sound basis to suggest that such
an undertaking will be inadequate, disclosure may be made for inspection of the letter by a
professional.77 A letter of wishes may also contain highly personal or confidential information

concerning the beneficiaries which may merit redaction. The Court may also order the
redaction of the letter so far as its provisions relate to other beneficiaries which are not
relevant to the rights of the beneficiary seeking disclosure of the letter.
The issue of disclosure of a letter of wishes can come before the Court via one of two routes:
either by proceedings commenced by the trustee for directions as to whether or not to disclose the letter78 or in proceedings commenced by a beneficiary. Where proceedings are commenced by the trustee, the trustee is obligated to give full and frank disclosure to the Court if
it wishes to obtain the Court's direction as to how to proceed.79 Where the beneficiaries are
convened to the proceedings, as will usually be the case, the trustee will have to carefully consider how the letter of wishes is admitted into the proceedings (which will usually be in private and protected by a privacy order) without destroying the confidentiality in it.80 Where
the trustee is considering, or has already refused, to disclose the letter to the beneficiaries and
is seeking either a blessing of that decision (or that decision is being challenged) the trustee
will have to give its reasons for refusal to the Court. As we have already discussed, the trustee
is entitled to withhold its reasons for decisions from the beneficiaries. The usual practice is
to adopt a procedure sometimes encountered in Beddoe proceedings where a hostile beneficiary has been convened to the trustee's Beddoe application.81 The material sought to be
disclosed should be treated in the same was as any privileged material against the beneficiary
in the action that is the subject of a Beddoe hearing and should be exhibited to the trustee's
affidavit but the material itself should not be served on the beneficiary.
The beneficiary seeking disclosure (and their legal representative) is usually excluded from
the courtroom when the content of the material and reasons against disclosure action are
discussed between the trustee's advocate and the court. The beneficiary will be permitted
to address the Court on any arguments they may wish concerning disclosure of the material and will be permitted to participate fully in the proceedings save where their exclusion
is necessary to preserve the confidentiality in the documents sought to be disclosed.82 This
procedure has been held in England not to be incompatible with Article 6 of the European
Convention on Human Rights.83 However, where a trustee seeks the Court's blessing of a
decision to exercise dispositive powers, in which a letter of wishes would undoubtedly be
disclosed to the Court, the Court may elect to short-circuit the general presumption against
the disclosure of a letter of wishes to beneficiaries by the instituting a separate procedure for
excluding the beneficiaries from seeing the letter of wishes in order to avoid a multiplicity
of proceedings.84

78 Such an application may or may not involve a surrender of the trustee's discretion but given the circumstances in which the Court will accept such a surrender are relatively narrow (see In re B Settlement [2010 JLR 653]
and Ch 3, para 3-19) the basis upon which the application will usually be made is where the trustee has decided
against disclosure and seeks the Court's blessing of that position.

It may be the case that the letter of wishes itself will have a bearing on whether (and to what
extent) disclosure of the letter of wishes and other documents within Articles 29(a)-(c)
should be disclosed to the beneficiaries.85 In those circumstances, the Court will have to
take a view for itself as to whether to review the letter of wishes and whether it should
be disclosed (and on what terms) to the beneficiaries before deciding whether to order
disclosure.86

5-45

Legal Advice and Communications with Lawyers
Where legal advice has been obtained by the trustee, at the expense of the trust, to guide the
trustee in the discharge of its functions, powers87 or discretions as trustee, the Court will normally order disclosure of legal advice and accompanying instructions to the beneficiaries.88
Such advice has normally been obtained to assist the trustee in the good administration
of the trust and is prima facie obtained for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The lawyer
who provided the legal advice will not disclose it to the beneficiary without the consent of
the trustee. The trustee, rather than the beneficiary, is the lawyer's client and it is with the
trustee rather than the beneficiary, that the lawyer will have his retainer. The privilege that
attaches to the advice is not the lawyer's but the trustee's to waive.89
It follows that the range of communications with lawyers that are usually disclosable to
beneficiaries on demand is relatively narrow,90 falling in the gap between communications
protected by legal advice privileged, communications that pertain to the reasons for the
exercise of a power or discretion (so as to fall inside the Re Londonderry exception) and
communications which are protected by litigation privilege (taking place within the context
of or in contemplation of hostile litigation with the trustee.
Where extensive disclosure of inter-trustee/lawyer communications is demanded by beneficiaries in the context of an application for directions by the trustee, while there was a strong
presumption in favour of disclosure, the Court may nevertheless exercise its discretion to
limit disclosure only to documents the beneficiaries need to make fully informed decisions
at the directions hearing.91 The Court has recognised there is a premium that attaches to
trustees, who have found themselves in need of directions from the Court, being able to
communicate with their lawyers without feeling inhibited by the fear of having to disclose
those communications with beneficiaries convened to the hearing.92 The factors the Court
will consider in deciding whether, what and in what form, to order disclosure of material in
the hands of the trustee in a directions hearing are as follows:93
1.

the context of the application, including the state of the relationship between the trustee and the beneficiaries, whether proceedings were afoot and if so for what;

85 eg where the letter of wishes reveals that a settlor wishes a particular beneficiary to only be considered as an
object of the trustee's dispositive powers in the event of a remote contingency.

the capacity in which the beneficiary was seeking disclosure, whether, as in the present
case, as a party convened to proceedings (in which case the test was for him to have
sufficient information to make fully informed decisions) or simply as a beneficiary
against the trustee (in which case there was a strong presumption in favour of disclosure, requiring good reason for refusal);
whether the disclosure sought was relevant to any current or potential issues;
the purpose for which disclosure was sought;
whether the application was a substantive request for specific documents and information or a fishing expedition which would engender further correspondence, additional
requests and significant costs, to the detriment of the other beneficiaries;
whether the documents concerned third parties and, if so, whether their interests
needed to be protected; and
whether an order for disclosure amounts to pre-action discovery.94

Disclosure of Information and Documents

Where the Court is sitting in a supervisory capacity under Article 51, the Court can direct
the trustee to waive privilege in any legal advice. Alternatively it may accept a surrender
of the trustee's discretion and waive any privilege in the advice of its own accord.95 The
privilege in such advice is held not for the personal benefit of the trustee but for the benefit
of the beneficiaries as a whole.96 Accordingly, privilege cannot be asserted as an absolutely
defence against a beneficiary's demand for disclosure of the advice. However, legal advice
which is obtained to support the reasons for the exercise of the trustee's powers or discretions in a particular way (as opposed to legal advice, say, as to the scope of a particular
power) is not generally disclosable to beneficiaries on demand, even if paid for from the
trust fund since such advice is properly to be regarded as material upon which the trustee's
decisions are or might be based and is within the Londonderry exception.97 However, there
are borderline examples of legal advice that may have been obtained in respect of a specific
exercise of powers but which are directed at the overall framework in which the power is
exercised and are therefore analogous to the sort of legal advice that would at least have the
potential to fall outside the Londonderry exception as it may be of such a general character
so as not to be the basis for a reason for the exercise of particular powers or discretions. One
example of such advice is generic advice concerning, for example, the impact of changes in
tax law on the trust fund or the scope of the trustee's powers to mitigate the tax exposure
of the fund or particular beneficiaries. Likewise, legal advice as to what are relevant and
irrelevant considerations in relation to the exercise of a particular power or whether the
exercise of a power in a particular way would amount to a fraud on a power, while closer to
the reasons for which the power is exercised, is unlikely to be withheld from a beneficiary by
the Court if the beneficiary requests them.

Disclosure of Communications with Lawyers in the Context of Hostile Proceedings with
the Trustee
A trustee who is sued for breach of trust or for other relief98 in hostile proceedings is not
liable to have legal advice and their other communications with their lawyers disclosed to
beneficiaries on demand.99 A trustee who is sued for breach of trust is prohibited from paying for the costs of their defence from trust assets.100 A trustee who, deliberately or inadvertently expends trust money on legal advice for its own personal benefits commits a breach of
trust and is liable to repay the sum expended on the advice to the trust fund101 but the effect
of using trust money in this way is not to deprive the trustee of right to assert privilege in
the communications and advice as a defence to their disclosure.102

5-50

iii. Category 3
The following categories of documents fall within category 3 (those documents falling
within Article 29 but not within Category 2 above, where the interests of the beneficiary
seeking disclosure are in conflict with those of other beneficiaries).
a. Company Documents
The Court's inherent jurisdiction to order disclosure of trust documents extends only
as between beneficiaries and trustees, qua beneficiary and trustee and does not extend,
despite earlier authority to the contrary,103 to trustees or beneficiaries who hold documents
in another role, such as directors of a company, even if the trust has an interest in that
company.104 Company directors owe duties to their company, not to the beneficiaries of a
trust that ultimately owns the shares of the company and will risk acting improperly, even
if acting together, if they release confidential information concerning the company to an
outsider, such as a beneficiary, without shareholder ratification of that decision. The Royal
Court has held that it is not permissible to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction to order
disclosure of documents directly against the directors of a company, even if they are also
beneficiaries and are before the Court in that capacity.105 The foundation of the Court's
supervisory jurisdiction lies in the nexus between trustee and beneficiary arising out of
the trust relationship. The fact that a person is a beneficiary is not of itself sufficient to

trustee's discretion except when the privileged communication was itself the means of carrying out a fraud; see

justify the making of an order: the order must be made for the purpose of vindicating, or
at least promoting, some right or interest arising directly out of the trust relationship.106
The authors are of the view that this is not the final word on the principles applicable to
the scope of the Court's power to authorise the production of companies under Article 51.
The approach of the Jersey Royal Court is currently more restrictive than the approach take
in neighbouring Guernsey following the Guernsey Court of Appeal's decision In the matter
of the R and RA Trusts which demonstrates a preference to maintain flexibility in the scope
of the inherent jurisdiction to order the production of documents and is likely to be highly
influential when the decision in In The Matter of the B, C and D Settlements comes back for
reconsideration before the Jersey Royal Court.
Company documents belong to the company itself and the beneficiaries have long been
held to have no proprietary interest in them.107 The Court will respect the integrity of the
separate corporate personality of any company in which the trust holds an interest and will
be reluctant to make an order that disregards the company's rights. That said, whether the
Court will order disclosure remains a matter of the Court's discretion. The English Court
of Appeal decision of Butt v Kelson108 established the following principles:
1.

The beneficiary must specify with precision which company documents he wishes to
see.
The beneficiary must have a proper case for seeing the documents.
There must be no valid objection by the other beneficiaries or from the company's
directors (on its behalf).
The beneficiary should give assurances the he will not disclose the documents or copies
to any third party.109

Disclosure of Information and Documents

If the trustee is, directly or indirectly, the shareholder of the company whose documents
are sought to be disclosed, the appropriate course is not, outside of the principles espoused
in Butt v Kelson, to provide a short-circuit for the trustee to give that disclosure. Instead
the appropriate course is for the trustee, qua shareholder, to use its voting rights in general
meeting either to compel disclosure or to modify any restriction in the company's articles
of association that prevents disclosure to shareholders of the company.110 A beneficiary
seeking disclosure via the trustee, qua shareholder, should seek an order that 'the trustee
procure the documents by asserting such rights as it has under company law to obtain disclosure from the directors of the company'.
Once the documents are in the hands of the trustee, qua trustee, the Court may order
the disclosure of the document to any person, not just a beneficiary, if it considers it

appropriate.111 Such disclosure may be subject to appropriate protections, such as undertakings as to the documents' confidentiality, in order to protect the confidentiality of the
company's affairs that would not otherwise be known to outsiders to the company.
Where, as is common in many Jersey trust structures, the underlying trust assets are vested
in a wholly owned holding company, rather than in the trustee directly, and where the
trustee appoints the directors of the holding company, there seems to us a good argument
that there is no substantive difference between that arrangement and one where the assets
are held by the trustee directly and so while taking account of the proper mechanisms in
obtaining information from a corporate structure, the fact that there is an intervening corporate entity between the trustee and the assets should make little difference to the exercise
of the Court's discretion as to what it should order the trustee be disclosed.112
In our view, anti-Bartlett113 type clauses, common in many Jersey trust instruments, have
no impact on the scope of the disclosure the Court can order a trustee, qua trustee, to produce on the basis that such clauses, are, subject to contrary drafting, directed at protecting
a trustee from liability if it does not intervene in the affairs of a company in which the trust
has an interest and do not, in the main, positively oblige the trustee not to do so.
Where the trust has an interest in a company that is not wholly owned by the trust, there
is a stronger presumption that the Court will not order disclosure of company documents
to the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries may reasonably seek disclosure of the company's balance sheet and profit and loss account, if not otherwise publicly available.114 The Court
may, it seems, even order disclosure of the shareholder and board minutes115 but there
is usually no jurisdiction to order the disclosure of documents that show the day-to-day
running of a trading company.116 In the Guernsey case of Bathurst, the Court's order for
disclosure was expressly on the basis that the companies were 'wholly-owned by the trusts
[…] in real terms, each company was, in all probability, a creature of the trusts'. It should
be remembered that a trustee that has less than a controlling interest in an underlying
company may not be in a position to require the company in which the trust has an interest
to do anything. In those circumstances, the Court has no power either under its inherent
jurisdiction or under the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 to convene or compel the company to
give disclosure of its internal workings.

Disclosure of Information and Documents

of information and documents concerning the trust.117 Even in cases where as a matter
of principle there is a strong presumption in favour of disclosure, such as accounts or the
trust instrument, the issue for the trustee, when a discretionary beneficiary makes a request
for documentation, is whether any disclosure should be made at all. The trustee's risk is
in judging when, if such disclosure is refused and the demand is renewed in proceedings
before the Royal Court, the Court will reach a different conclusion from the trustee so as
to put the trustee at risk as to costs.118 In many cases the Court will have no difficulty in
concluding that a discretionary beneficiary ought to be granted relief.
The plaintiff beneficiary seeking disclosure bears the burden of proving that his or her
prospects of benefiting from the trust are sufficiently real to merit the Court's intervention
in ordering disclosure. We consider that the evidential burden shifts from the beneficiary
to the trustee who is resisting disclosure once the beneficiary has discharged the burden on
him to show his expectation of benefit was real and substantial.
The extent of the discretionary object's expectation to information and disclosure of documents pertaining to the trust are relevant also to the extent of the relief the Court can be
expected to grant. Where the expectation of benefit is more than theoretical but nonetheless real, the Court is more likely to order limited disclosure of, say, accounts relevant to the
beneficiaries' interest but there is likely to be a presumption against more detailed disclosure and disclosure of sensitive confidential information which would likely remain beyond
the beneficiaries' reach.

ii. Unascertained Beneficiaries or Beneficiaries with a Mere Future Expectation of
Interest
5-62

A beneficiary of a trust whose interest is based upon being a member of a class of persons
that is to be ascertained in the future (in contrast with a beneficiary who has a present but
contingent interest) has no present entitlement or locus before the Court to protection of
his interest by a court order for disclosure of documents and information.

iii. Beneficiaries with an Existing but Remote Fixed Interest under the Trust
5-63

5-64

The position of a beneficiary who has a present but defeasible or contingent interest can
be contrasted again with a beneficiary who will, if they live long enough, take under a fixed
interest trust. A beneficiary in the first category is entitled, by virtue of their position, to
seek disclosure under the principles in Re Rabiotti and Schmidt v Rosewood. Whether the
Court will order disclosure and its extent is another matter.
In vindicating a beneficiaries' right to information, the Court will make an evaluation of
the remoteness of the beneficiaries' entitlement to benefit from the trust. Where the beneficiary's interest is contingent upon the happening of some remote event that is outside the
control of the trustees or other persons upon whom powers are conferred, the approach of
the Court is likely to be similar to that when a question arises of distribution on the footing

241

that a highly improbably event will not occur.119 Where the interest may be dependent
instead on the non-exercise of a power conferred by the trust instrument, the approach of
the Court is likely to be similar to that adopted by the Court in the case of disclosure to any
other discretionary object.

iv. Minor Beneficiaries
In ordinary circumstances, trustees may disclose information and documents to parents or
guardians having parental responsibility for minor beneficiaries in the same way as if those
beneficiaries were of full age and capacity. If the trustee fails to do so, parents or those with
parental responsibility have no locus before the Jersey courts to commence proceedings for
disclosure in their own name. The appropriate procedure is to commence proceedings in
the name of the minor as their guardian ad litem.120 It is likely to be appropriate for the
trustee to insist that the parent agree to ensure any material disclosed remains confidential.
The trustee should satisfy itself that the person seeking disclosure on behalf of a minor
beneficiary has parental responsibility for the minor beneficiary. Where there is more than
one person with parental responsibility for a minor beneficiary, the trustees should not give
disclosure without the written consent of the person with whom parental responsibility is
shared. The trustees should exercise extreme caution and may instead surrender their decision to the Court rather than take the risk of a decision themselves, if the request for information is made by a parent in the context of an existing or pending parental or matrimonial
dispute where the resources available to a minor beneficiary are relevant in any application
between the parents concerning the maintenance of children.

5-65

v. Former Beneficiaries and those with Doubtful Status as Beneficiaries
There is no reason in principle why a person who has ceased to be a beneficiary is not entitled to seek an order for disclosure of information and documents that pertain to the period
for which they were still a beneficiary and for which period the trustee remains, subject to
prescription, accountable. A person that becomes excluded from the beneficial class pursuant to powers in the trust instrument is, we think, entitled to seek and obtain disclosure of
the instrument in which such powers is exercised. Where there is no challenge to the validity
of the beneficiary's removal, as was the case in the Re Internine Trust, a court will err on the
side of not ordering disclosure of accounts and information about the trust after the date of
removal where the trust is likely to continue after the removal of the beneficiary.121

Disclosure of Information and Documents

A plaintiff who seeks a determination as to his interest or rights as a beneficiary is entitled, by the litigation process, to obtain disclosure of documents relevant to his claim to
the extent permitted by r 6/17 RCR 2004122 but not, usually, under the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. However, the Royal Court, with the approval of the Court of Appeal,
has ordered disclosure to a person in relation to a period in which a person's status as a
beneficiary was in dispute in circumstances where the beneficiary had undeniably been a
beneficiary and where it would be many years before the identity of those in the beneficial
class would be finally determined.123

D. Procedure in Applications for Disclosure of Trust Documents and
Information
5-68

An application to the Court, whether by the trustee or by a beneficiary seeking disclosure,
will normally be made by way of Representation under the Court's inherent jurisdiction to
give a direction as to the execution or the administration a trust. Applications for disclosure
of trust information, particularly if the information that is sought to be disclosed is sensitive are usually heard in private.124 It is the usual practice to join the beneficiaries that have
an interest in the outcome of the demand for disclosure although there is no automatic
rule that all the beneficiaries should be joined as parties to the proceedings.125 While the
Royal Court may refer the assessment of a trustee's fees for reasonableness to the Master,
only the Royal Court sitting in the Inferior Number and not the Master,126 may exercise
the Court's inherent jurisdiction to order the disclosure of trust documents.127 Therefore,
if the beneficiaries seek disclosure from the trustee in order to consider whether or not to
challenge a trustee's fees on the basis that they have been unreasonably incurred, the scope
of the beneficiaries' right to the information, is an issue that needs to be determined by the
Royal Court.

E. Disclosure and The Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005
5-69

A detailed examination of the provisions of the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005 is well
beyond the scope of this work but will need to be considered alongside the principles under
general trust law set out in this chapter. A trustee is a data controller128 of personal data129
for the purposes of the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005, which places restrictions on the
122

Discovery and inspection of documents.
Re Internine Trust and Intertraders Trust [2004] JCA 158; however, the jurisdiction to do so is to be regarded
as requiring exceptional circumstances and any question as to disclosure would ordinarily be deferred until any
issue as to whether or not a party was a beneficiary was determined.

243

processing130 of personal data and confers statutory rights on a person (the data subject)
to personal data relating to himself.131 The 2005 law does not confer any general right on a
data subject to seek information relating to any other person and a trustee may well resist
disclosing such information voluntarily citing its obligations as a data controller for that
individual data subject.

F. Restrictions on Disclosure in the Trust Instrument
Article 29 expressly provides for the possibility that even the beneficiary's entitlement
under Article 29(d) to demand any document which relates to or forms part of the accounts
of the trust is subject to contrary provision in the trust instrument itself. It seems to us
perfectly possible that the trust may provide for an enlargement of the beneficiaries' entitlement to documents and information concerning the trust, for example by providing
an absolute right to see trust accounts in place of the Court's overriding discretion. The
phrasing of Article 29 suggests that a settlor may theoretically 'contract out' of or restrict
the beneficiary's prima facie entitlement to such documents. However, disclosure to beneficiaries under the trust is the principal mechanism by which the trustee is held to account.
This is part of the fundamental and irreducible core of obligations at the heart of the trust
relationship.132 It seems more likely that a blanket prohibition on the beneficiaries' access
to accounts and information will be held to be ineffective, amounting, as it does, to an
impermissible fetter on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. It is probably not permissible to
exclude the accountability of trustees at the instance of some or all of the beneficiaries who
will be unable to seek accounts if they know nothing of the existence of the settlement or
their interests under it.133
The real issue is what restrictions are permissible. Restrictions on the information that
may be disclosed, distinct from a general exclusion of accountability, are likely to be valid
provided they do not purport to encroach upon the overarching supervisory jurisdiction
of the Court. Such a provision does not oust the beneficiary from seeking to vindicate their
information rights before the Court where the mechanism that is provided for in the trust
instrument does not result in disclosure. The Court has power to order disclosure to the
beneficiary if it is satisfied that the beneficiary has made out a case for disclosure of the
information or documents sought.134 Elaborate mechanisms by which disclosure requires
the consent of a third party, such as seeking the approval of the Court, or the approval
of a protector, may have the desired effect of deterring beneficiaries from persisting with
demands for information. However, a power to consent to the disclosure of information,
vested in a protector, is liable to be categorised as at least a special if not a fiduciary power
to be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries as a whole unless clearly drafted to

the contrary.135 Where the Court's consent is required before disclosure can be made, it
seems to us that the Court will proceed to make an order in accordance with the principles
of Schmidt v Rosewood if no specific parameters or exclusions are prescribed. In our view,
while it may be possible to restrict the trustee's disclosure obligations, the Court will closely
scrutinise such provision in the trust instrument which will always be subject to the Court's
jealously guarded overriding discretion to regulate the issue of disclosure.

G. The Proper Law Governing the Principles of Disclosure of Trust
Information
5-72

The right of a beneficiary to seek disclosure of trust documents and information is, unless
there is provision for dépeçage136 in relation to the trust's administration, governed by the
proper law of the trust.137 Where the proper law of the trust is Jersey, any question concerning the disclosure of documents is protected by the firewall provisions in Article 9(1)(d) of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, as a question concerning the administration of a trust, which
require the question of disclosure to be determined in accordance with the principles of
Jersey law before any request for disclosure will be given effect to by an order of the Royal
Court. The authors are doubtful whether the Court's supervisory jurisdiction to intervene
in the trust's administration either to order or restrict disclosure of trust documents and
information can circumvent restrictions in the proper law on disclosure existing under the
applicable proper law.

H. The Costs of a Demand for Trust Documents and Information
5-73

5-74

There are two issues as to the costs of complying with a demand for the disclosure of documents. The first is who pays for the physical production of the documents. The second is
who pays for the costs of any legal proceedings that are commenced because the trustee
refuses to give disclosure of documents on demand. Where copies of documents are held
and easily produced in electronic rather than a hardcopy format, the costs of producing
documents in electronic form is usually negligible. Where a beneficiary insists upon hard
copies of documents, it will be for the trustee and beneficiary to negotiate an agreed sum
which represents the trustee's actual cost of their production. The cost of drawing up the
trust's accounts is a cost properly and reasonably incurred in the execution of the trust and
can be reimbursed from the fund by way of the trustee's indemnity.138 There is English
authority that the costs of preparing copies of the accounts for a beneficiary should properly be borne by the beneficiary and not the trust.139
A separate issue is the cost risk in bringing a dispute about disclosure of trust documents
and information to court. A trustee who unreasonably refuses to disclose documents to a

beneficiary and therefore causes the beneficiary to incur unnecessary legal cost in seeking
orders for disclosure is on risk as to costs and will usually be required to pay the beneficiary's costs of that application on the indemnity basis and will not be permitted its own
costs from the fund.140 If a trustee has a genuine doubt about revealing confidential information, the correct course is for the trustee to apply to the Court for directions at an early
stage. Such an application will usually involve either a complete surrender of the trustee's
discretion as to whether to give disclosure to the Court141 or alternatively, the application
may seek a blessing of the trustee's momentous decision to grant disclosure or withhold it,
in whole or in part.

I. Disclosure of Trust Documents to Settlors and Protectors
A settlor is not entitled to disclosure of documents or information concerning a trust
simply by virtue of being the settlor.142 There must be provision in the trust instrument
that confers a right to disclosure from the trustees to provide a basis on which to be given
information, either by consent, or for the Court to grant relief. The settlor who is also a
beneficiary, whether under the terms of the trust, or by virtue of a resulting trust upon the
termination of the trust period, is entitled to seek the disclosure of information or documents, qua beneficiary.143
A settlor who reserves to himself, or has conferred upon him, fiduciary or special ­powers144
in relation to the trust, is in principle, entitled to seek information and have access to documents which are reasonably incidental to the exercise of his powers and functions and be
given such access by the trustees, subject to similar conditions as to the preservation of
confidentiality, as applies to beneficiaries. In the authors' view the same principles apply to
disclosure to a protector who is not the settlor. It follows that where a settlor or protector
has functions in relation to the trust, the beneficiaries may, on the basis of the principles
in Schmidt v Rosewood, seek disclosure of trust information and documents held by the
settlor or protector in connection with those functions.145 However, such information and
documents that go to the reasons for which the settlor or protector have made a decision, as
in the case of trustees, is protected by the principles already discussed in Re Londonderry's
Settlement.
Where trustees are bound to have regard to the settlor's wishes concerning the administration of the trusts, rather than, as is more usual, merely being entitled to have regard to

142 Settlors have a statutory entitlement to information concerning their trust conferred by ss 26(1)(b)(iii) and
26(2) of the Trusts Guernsey Law 2007, which has no equivalent in Jersey.
143 See Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 42. Although the settlor's beneficial entitlement under a resulting trust
upon the exhaustion of the trust period or upon the deaths of every member of the nominated beneficial class
may be so remote for the Court to approach the question of disclosure on the same basis as that of an event that
is highly unlike to occur.

1984, Art 9A.

Disclosure of Information and Documents

those wishes, there is likely to be a stronger basis for the settlor seeking and (if he pressed
the matter to proceedings) being entitled to information concerning the trust. Such a situation is similar to the involvement of settlor in the administration of the trust by virtue of
having powers conferred upon him. If the trustees are to be bound to have regard to the
settlor's wishes, it is more rather than less likely to be in the interests of the beneficiaries if
the settlor's expressed wishes are informed.
Trustees should not disclose documents and information to the settlor if such disclosure
cannot be reasonably justified by reference to their administration of the trust. Trustees
should not succumb to a desire to placate a settlor by providing disclosure to them safe
in the knowledge that such letters of wishes they receive back are not binding upon them.
Trustees who do so may be in breach of their duty of confidentiality to the beneficiaries.
Where the trustee suspect that the settlor's demands for information are based on a desire
to interfere or control the trustee's decision-making process rather than just provide the
trustee with his informed wishes, the Court is likely to uphold the trustee's decision to
refuse disclosure if the settlor were to bring proceedings for disclosure orders.
Where there is no question of a tax liability impacting upon the trust property, there will
normally be no objection to disclosure to the settlor concerning the trust to enable the
settlor to discharge his tax liabilities, subject again to appropriate safeguards as to confidentiality. Where such disclosure would give rise to a negative impact upon the trust property,
the question is more finely balanced and may legitimately require an application for directions. While the trustees may not owe any duties to the settlor qua settlor, it may not be in
the interests of the beneficiaries for the trustee's refusal to give disclosure to the settlor to
lead to a confrontation between the settlor and the fiscal authorities if that situation has the
potential to lead to the greater exposure of the fund.

J. Disclosure by Outgoing Trustees to their Successors
5-80

An incoming trustee, whether appointed by court order or under the provisions of the trust
instrument is entitled to require the former trustee to deliver up all records, books and
other papers pertaining to the trust which the incoming trustee may reasonable require
to administer the trust.146 The incoming trustee is also entitled to inspect and copy other
papers in the hands of the former trustee so far as they contain information that relates to

146 In the matter of the Bird Charitable Trust and the Bird Purpose Trust (n 15) at [26]; Tiger v Barclays Bank
Limited [1952] 1 All ER 85. Practical guidance on the classes of documents that should normally be surrendered
or made available to an incoming trustee are listed in R Williams, A Straker and T Graham, A Practical Guide to the
Transfer of Trusteeships, 2nd edn (STEP, 2011) but will usually include: (1) the governing documents including the
trust instrument, any dispositive instruments, all instruments transferring trusteeship, instruments of indemnity
and release, formal notices of assignment of beneficial interests, letters of wishes, minutes of the trustee's meetings, trustee resolutions (and all supporting materials) instruments of appointment or retirement of protectors
or other power holders, correspondence with the protectors or other power holders; (2) the trust accounts (for
at least the last 3 years, including accounts for all underlying entities, book keeping ledgers from the last year end
to date (including a trial balance), tax certificates and tax returns for at least the last 3 years, current investment
valuations and bank statements, documentation concerning loans to beneficiaries or from third parties, all contracts with third parties); (3) documents of title to trust assets, documents relating to undertakings, guarantees or
indemnity, security documentation, leases); and (4) legal documents (including documentation concerning any

the trust.147 The papers which the incoming trustee is entitled to see and obtain copies of
include the minutes or memoranda of the meetings of the trustee and the former trustee's
correspondence files.148 In the exercise of its overriding supervisory jurisdiction the Court
may qualify the incoming trustee's entitlement to delivery up and disclosure. Where the
papers may be voluminous, the Court is likely to take a practical or staged approach to
disclosure and will order as a starting point, that the outgoing trustee, so far as they are a
reasonably able, provide the incoming trustee with sufficient information to enable it to
administer the assets, with an explanation supported by affidavit if they are not reasonably
so able, with liberty to apply if further disclosure is required.149 The incoming trustee is not
obliged to embark upon an exhaustive search for breaches of trust by its predecessor but is
obliged to undertake a reasonable review and investigate if a breach of trust comes to his
notice.150 Where the documents provided by the outgoing trustee do not contain information and explanations that may be sought by the incoming trustee, the incoming trustee is
entitled to request such information if the request is reasonable and the outgoing trustee is
obliged to cooperate and supply the information.151 The outgoing trustee is under a duty
to take reasonable care that the information it does supply is accurate.152 Where the outgoing trustee does comply with its duties in the provision of information and documents the
incoming trustee may seek a court order to force compliance by way of summons or by way
of Representation.153

K. Disclosure to Foreign Revenue Authorities
Jersey is a party to 37 separate Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs).154 A TIEA
is a bilateral international agreement between the States of Jersey and other jurisdictions to
legal proceedings in which the trustee has been engaged on behalf of the trust, instructions to counsel. An outgoing trustee can usually be expected to retain and make available upon request the correspondence files, historic
asset valuations and bank statements, trust accounts and accounts for underlying entities older than 3 years and
the trustee's KYC documentation.

exchange information relevant to their domestic tax laws. In order to comply with international standards of financial regulation, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, Jersey has been an early adopter of the principles set out in the OECD
Model Tax Convention upon which all of Jersey's TIEAs are based.155 TIEAs are entered
into pursuant to the provisions of the Taxation (Exchange of Information with Third
Countries) Regulations 2008, as amended.156 A TIEA is not a tool by which private parties
to civil proceeding may obtain disclosure of tax information from Jersey, but is primarily
used at an intergovernmental level. A TIEA does not permit the enforcement of foreign
revenue claims in Jersey157 but the information obtained by the Comptroller and provided
to a foreign government pursuant to a TIEA is directed at the enforcement of the requesting
state's domestic tax laws. In Jersey, requests from a foreign government with whom Jersey
has a TIEA must be made to the Comptroller of Taxes.

i. Scope of Information under a TIEA
5-82

5-83

The scope of information that can be obtained under each TIEA is broadly the same
although the individual taxes covered may vary in each TIEA as agreed between the countries party to them. In order to be able to request assistance a requesting state must prove
that the requested information is foreseeably relevant: to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the parties concerning the taxes covered by the TIEA; and to
the determination, assessment, enforcement or collection of tax or to the investigation of
tax matters or prosecution of criminal tax matters. There is no obligation to provide information which is not either held by or in the possession of the Comptroller or is obtainable
by persons who are within Jersey.
Pursuant to the Regulations the Comptroller has authority within Jersey to obtain and
provide upon request, tax information held by banks, other financial institutions and any
person, including nominees and trustees, acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity; as well
as information regarding the ownership of companies, partnerships, collective investment
schemes, trusts, foundations and other persons, including information on all persons in an
ownership chain, and in the case of trusts (even trusts that are not Jersey law trusts), information on settlors, trustees, protectors and beneficiaries. Notwithstanding that neither the
enabling 2004 legislation nor the 2008 Regulations themselves contain any positive power
for the Comptroller to transmit tax information to a foreign competent authority under
a TEIA, that is not a valid basis for challenge; the power of the Comptroller to provide
information under a TIEA is to be implied as necessarily ancillary to the power to obtain

that information.158 Where the request for information includes information foreseeably
relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of such taxes, the recovery and
enforcement of tax claims (ie civil tax matters), the request can only be made for matters
arising on or after the date of execution of the TIEA.159 Requests for information concerning criminal tax matters can be made for any period prior to or after the execution of
the TIEA.160 However, there appears to be no restriction on the use to which information
obtained in the course of a criminal tax investigation may be used within the scope of
Article 1, such as a civil tax assessment.161 Tax Information is defined as
any fact, statement, document or record in whatever form or within an individual's knowledge or
belief that is foreseeably relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of taxes within
the scope of the TIEA; the recovery and enforcement of such taxes; the recovery and enforcement
of tax claims; or the investigation or prosecution of tax matters.162

ii. Requests for Information
Each TIEA sets out what a request should contain with emphasis placed upon the 'greatest
detail' being provided by the requesting state; however, there are a uniform set of requirements for any request. Each request must be in writing and must contain:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

6.
7.
8.

the identity of the person under examination or investigation;
the period for which the information is requested;
the nature of the information requested and the form in which the requesting state
would prefer to receive it;
the tax purpose for which the information is sought;
the reasons for believing that the information requested is foreseeably relevant to the
tax administration and enforcement of the requesting state, with respect to the person
identified in number (1) of this list;
grounds for believing that the information requested is in the possession of the Comptroller or is in the possession of or obtainable by a person within Jersey;
to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession
of or able to obtain the information requested;
a statement that the request conforms with the laws and administrative practice of the
requesting state, that if the requested information was within the jurisdiction of the
requesting state then the competent authority of the requesting state would be able to
obtain the information under the laws of the requesting state or in the normal course
of administrative practice and that the request is in conformity with the TIEA; and

a statement that the requesting state has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information, except where that would give rise to disproportionate
difficulty.

The Jersey Court of Appeal has observed that at the heart of the TIEA regime is tension between the private interest in commercial confidentiality and the public interest
in international co-operation in the investigation of potential tax evasion.163 There is no
mandatory standard template for procedures under a TIEA: 'The question is whether a
less intrusive measure could have been used without unacceptably compromising the
objective'.164 Margins of appreciation must be accorded to legislatures sensitive to and
­sensible of local circumstances. The proper question is whether in their current form those
regulations are: first, within the enabling power; second, compatible with the Human Rights
Law and, third, proportionate.165 It has been held that the 2008 Regulations, as amended,
are compatible with the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000166
If a request is not compliant with the above, the Comptroller may decline to assist. Where
a foreign authority cannot provide the Comptroller with any reasonable basis for believing that the person subject to any tax investigation will have any useful information, the
Comptroller may decline to provide the information requested.167 That said, the evidential threshold that the Comptroller needs to satisfy himself of in respect of the matters in
Regulation 3 is whether there are 'reasonable grounds for believing' they are satisfied. The
Comptroller is under no obligation to require the production of evidence in support of
facts of which he is informed in order to verify them for himself.

iii. Notices Issued by the Comptroller
5-87

There are two categories of notices that the Comptroller is able to issue under the Regulations upon receipt of a request from a foreign competent authority that he deems reasonable to progress: (1) notices issued direct to taxpayers (ie the individuals or entities that are
the subject of the request from the foreign competent authority); or (2) notices issued to
third parties ('Third Party Notice') in relation to information regarding a taxpayer. These
notices must be issued in writing. Where a Third Party Notice is issued, the Comptroller
must provide the taxpayer in question with a copy of the Third Party Notice within seven
days. However, the Regulations provide for circumstances where the Comptroller need not
provide the taxpayer with a copy of the notice, and indeed, prohibit the third party in
question from disclosing the Third Party Notice to the taxpayer or any information relating thereto. A recipient of a notice will not incur any civil or criminal liability by reason of
compliance with the notice and providing information to the Comptroller.168 The Comptroller would not need to disclose the Third Party Notice to the taxpayer if he is satisfied

that, for example, (1) the taxpayer has committed a criminal offence; (2) disclosure to the
taxpayer would prejudice the assessment, collection or recovery of tax or the investigation
or prosecution of tax matters; or (3) the requesting foreign competent authority requests
that the taxpayer not be informed due to concerns similar to (1) and (2) above. Where a
third party is prohibited from disclosing the notice to the taxpayer, it cannot do so unless it
is able to obtain written consent from the Comptroller or the Royal Court of Jersey. Breach
of the prohibition is a criminal offence. The Third Party Notice need not name the taxpayer
to whom it relates provided that it states an account number or other, similar, identification
for the tax information required. In the event that the Third Party Notice does not name a
taxpayer or at the time the Third Party Notice is given, the Comptroller does not know the
taxpayer's name and address, the Comptroller would need to provide the taxpayer with a
copy of the Third Party Notice within seven days from receiving the response and information from the third party (unless the Comptroller has reasons not to notify the taxpayer as
set out above).

iv. Challenges to Notices Issued by the Comptroller
Upon receipt of a notice, the taxpayer or a third party can choose to (1) comply with the
requirements of the notice and produce the information requested within 15 days of receipt
of the notice; or (2) challenge the notice. Failure to respond to the notice within the time
frame provided, or making any statements in any response that are false, misleading or
deceptive are offences under the Regulations (and individuals guilty of such offences would
be liable to 12 months' imprisonment and a fine). There are additional offences listed
in the Regulations, including aiding and abetting, or liability of directors, managers and
partners of body corporates and partnerships who commit offences. On 6 November 2013, the
Taxation (Exchange of Information with Third Countries) (Amendment No 7) (Jersey)
Regulations 2013 came into force which introduced a number of material amendments to the
Regulations. A series of amendments to the 2008 Regulations in 2013 greatly reduced reduce
the procedural rights accorded to taxpayers when compared with the 2008 Regulations
in their original form. The position in Jersey can be compared with the United Kingdom
whereby greater rights are accorded where requests are made under a TIEA.169 The 2008
Regulations as amended provide that no reasons are required for the sending of notices;
Regulation 14 introduces a 14-day time limit in which to bring proceedings to challenge a
notice, Regulation 14(2) excludes certain grounds for judicial review from the scope of such
challenge, makes compliance with a notice mandatory notwithstanding inception of judicial review proceedings; and the right of appeal from a judicial review is to the Privy Council directly which will apply its own determination as to whether leave should be granted.
Most importantly, the purpose of the amendments was to narrow the scope of challenge to
notices, by forcing a taxpayer or third party into a judicial review of the Comptroller's decision, ie establishing that the Comptroller was acting illegally, irrationally, unreasonably or
his decision-making was procedurally improper. Prior to this amendment, if a taxpayer or
third party was to challenge a notice, it did so by way of an administrative appeal, and the
Court would consider the matter 'de novo' (or afresh). Additionally, the amendments have
removed the requirement on the Comptroller to provide the taxpayer with his 'reasons' for

issuing the notice, thereby limiting the information presented to recipients of notices and
making it more difficult to challenge notices received from the Comptroller. A third party
will also not be able to use a prohibition or failure to notify a taxpayer as a ground of challenge. Therefore the Regulations now provide that any challenge must be made by way of
judicial review, within 14 days of receipt of the notice. It is important to note that where
a party wishes to challenge the notice, they are still required to provide the response and
information requested to the Comptroller within the time frame stipulated in the notice, or
15 days if no deadline is given. Further, if an application for judicial review is unsuccessful,
an appeal can only be made to the Privy Council, provided that leave to appeal is granted.
Accordingly, there shall be no right of appeal to Jersey's Court of Appeal. The Comptroller
must not provide to the foreign competent authority the tax information provided by the
taxpayer or third party until the time period for commencing an application for judicial
review has expired, the application for judicial review has been withdrawn or dismissed, or
he is permitted to do so by the Royal Court.
Prior to the amendment of the Regulations, the only authority concerning challenges of
notices was the Volaw case, where it was held that
It is no part of the Comptroller's function when deciding whether to issue a Regulation 3 notice in
response to a request under the TIEA, or this Court's function on any appeal from such a decision,
to resolve contentious issues of Norwegian tax law or to reach definitive conclusions about whether
the person the subject of the request is or is not liable to Norwegian tax. Indeed, in the ordinary
way it is unlikely that the Comptroller would have expert evidence of Norwegian tax law in front of
him at the time when he is called upon to make his decision…and it would be impractical that he
should be required to obtain such evidence and undertake a process of detailed evaluation before
coming to a conclusion.

5-90

The threshold which the Comptroller therefore had to meet was low. It has to be seen how
the Royal Court treats the decision-making process of the Comptroller in the context of a
judicial review. The authors are currently involved in a judicial review application which,
we believe, will be the first under the Regulations, as amended.

IV. Disclosure of Trust Documents and Information in Hostile
Proceedings against the Trustee

The rules described above, for the disclosure of information and documents under the
Court's supervisory jurisdiction are distinct170 from the rules on discovery set out in the
Royal Court Rules 2004171 applicable to proceedings commenced against the current or former trustee for breach of trust, or challenging the trustee's decisions other than those pertaining to the disclosure of documents or information under the supervisory jurisdiction.

A. Pre-action Discovery of Documents
Jersey's rules of civil procedure do not currently permit for pre-action discovery of documents in trust litigation172 (other than in limited circumstances against non-parties under
Jersey's equivalent to the Norwich Pharmacal/Bankers Trust jurisdiction.173 Notwithstanding that the Royal Court has power to compel the disclosure of any document by a trustee
to any person under its inherent jurisdiction, which the Court will not permit to be used
as a backdoor route to pre-action discovery against a trustee,174 the Royal Court Rules do
not admit of an equivalent pre-action protocol procedure as found in the English civil procedure whereby parties are positively encouraged to exchange information and documents
prior to the commencement of proceedings in order to narrow the issues between them.175

5-92

B. Norwich Pharmacal and Bankers Trust Orders
The Royal Court has jurisdiction to make an order under the jurisdiction established in the
English case of Norwich Pharmacal v Customs & Excise Commissioners.176 A Norwich Pharmacal order requires the person against whom it is made to give disclosure of information
and documents to a plaintiff to enable the plaintiff to identify the correct defendant and
possibly so as to make a correct claim and obtain justice. The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction was originally a means to obtain information to identify a defendant, but this relief
now has a wider application extending to the obtaining of information to substantiate a
cause of action as well as to the discovery and protection of tracing claims.177 This jurisdiction is available to permit the making of interlocutory orders against third parties requiring
them to give disclosure regarding the assets of wrongdoers.178 A third party that becomes
involved in an attempt by a defendant to make himself judgment-proof or to defraud creditors, may be ordered to give full disclosure about assets (whether held in the defendant's
name or the name of the third party) under the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to assist the
plaintiff in the vindication of his proprietary rights.179

Where the Court is asked to make an order, it will consider:180

whether it was satisfied that there was a good arguable case that the plaintiff was the
victim of wrongdoing;
whether it was satisfied, to the same standard, that the defendant was 'mixed up' in that
wrongdoing; and
whether, as a matter of discretion, it was in the interests of justice to order the defendant to make disclosure.

Disclosure of Information and Documents

In New Media Holding Company LLC v Capita Fiduciary Group Limited,181 the Royal Court
took the opportunity to make the following observations about the jurisdiction:
1.

The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction is an extraordinary one which should be exercised
lightly.
Although there was no formal requirement that a plaintiff has to establish that it was
necessary for the Court to make a Norwich Pharmacal order because there was no other
way to gain access to the information sought, if a plaintiff had a straightforward and
available alternative means of obtaining the information it would probably not be a
reasonable exercise of discretion for the court to make a Norwich Pharmacal order.
The Court would have to consider carefully the purposes for which a Norwich Pharmacal order was sought (which could be for the identification of potential defendants in
litigation, or for other purposes, whether in connection with other litigation which was
continuing or for the purpose of taking other lawful steps, albeit not steps in a court
of law).
A defendant in Norwich Pharmacal proceedings need not have been innocently involved
in the wrongdoing of which the plaintiff complained and may be a wrongdoer himself.
The Court would have to consider very carefully an application for a Norwich Pharmacal order against an alleged wrongdoer because, other than the disclosure permitted
under the Law Reform (Disclosure and Conduct before Action) (Jersey) Law 1999,182
pre-action discovery was not permitted under Jersey law. It would be very unlikely
that a Norwich Pharmacal order would be made if the Court were satisfied that its primary purpose was to obtain pre-action discovery. The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction
does not impose upon 'mixed up' third parties a general obligation to give discovery or
information when the identity of the defendant is already known.183
In an appropriate case, a Norwich Pharmacal order could be made to assist proceedings
in another court, whether in Jersey or overseas. Norwich Pharmacal relief would be
available to identify a potential defendant in foreign proceedings or to establish a cause
of action or tracing claim for the purposes or foreign proceedings but it would not be
granted if the predominant purpose was to supplement the disclosure process in an
overseas court.184 A foreign court would be permitted to exercise its own jurisdiction
over the disclosure that it required to do justice in the substantive case before it.

The Royal Court has expressed itself as regarding the jurisdiction to order the production of banking documents under the Bankers Trust jurisdiction as deriving from the
principles that underpin the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to such an extent that the
two original jurisdictions overlap to such a very considerable extent that the Bankers
Trust jurisdiction has in practice been subsumed almost entirely by the Norwich
­Pharmacal jurisdiction.185 In the ordinary case, where a person can be ordered to give
information under the equitable jurisdiction to help preserve and protect traceable
funds, it is hard to imagine that he will not also have become 'mixed up' in the wrongdoing. If there are cases in which there is a meaningful distinction between the jurisdictional limits of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction and the Bankers Trust jurisdiction,
it has been held that the limits of the Bankers Trust jurisdiction are that the jurisdiction rests upon the proposition that unless the assets in question can be located and
secured, the ultimate determination of ownership of those assets may be frustrated by
their removal or dissipation and there will be no point in calling on the third party at
the trial to produce the required documents or give the requested information. In a
Bankers Trust186 application, the plaintiff must demonstrate a real prospect that the
information may lead to the location or preservation of assets to which he is making a
proprietary claim.187

i. Procedure to Obtain Norwich Pharmacal Relief
Norwich Pharmacal relief is obtained by way of an Order of Justice. The application is therefore a free-standing set of proceedings in their own right from any proceedings in which
the disclosure obtained by reason of the Norwich Pharmacal proceedings is used. The relief
sought is in the nature of a mandatory injunction for disclosure and so the Order of Justice
falls within r 20/5 RCR 2004 so as to require the Bailiff 's signature before it can be served
on the party against whom it is made pursuant to the Royal Court Rules for service of an
Order of Justice.188 The draft Order of Justice must be supported by an affidavit setting out
the basis upon which the relief is sought. The relief may be obtained ex parte in urgent cases
or where there is a credible risk that documents would be lost or destroyed were notice to
be given, in which case the plaintiff is under a duty of full and frank disclosure,189 but more

for that purpose, although in Systems Design Ltd v The President of Equatorial Guinea 2005-06 GLR 65 at 59 the
Guernsey Court of Appeal held that the Royal Court of Guernsey did have jurisdiction to grant Norwich Pharmacal proceedings in aid of foreign proceeding on the basis that the jurisdiction should be widely interpreted. It
was important for Guernsey as a financial services centre to ensure it did not become a safe haven for those who
sought to evade financial liabilities. The contention was not pursued in the Privy Council ([2006] UKPC 7) which
determined the appeal on other issues.

C. Discovery of Documents during the Course of Proceedings
5-97

5-98

The applicable rules of discovery in the Royal Court Rules 2004 are those concerning the
discovery and inspection of documents under r 6/17 RCR 2004 and those concerning provision for discovery by interrogatories under r 6/16 RCR 2004. Both of these sets or rules
are based upon the former RSC Ord 26 and RSC Ord 24. As under the former Ord 26 discovery under r 6/17 RCR 2004 requires discovery of all documents191 relating to the matters
in question that are in the possession, custody or power of the party making discovery.192
A party gives discovery of a document by stating whether the document exists or has existed
in their possession, custody or power.193 A beneficiary subject to discovery obligations
under r 6/17 RCR 2004 must discover all documents in their possession, custody or control
regardless of whether the discoverable documents are held in a capacity other than as a beneficiary in the proceedings in which the obligation arises.194 It should be noted that ownership of documents is not relevant to a party's discovery obligations in respect of them.
The confidentiality of the documents, as distinct from any privilege in the documents, is
not a basis upon which discovery and inspection may be withheld.195 In many, if not most,
cases a beneficiary joined to proceedings (that does not already physically possess originals
or copies) will not have trust documents within their control capable of being discovered.
That is because a beneficiary does not have an automatic right to trust documents from the
trustee.196 The beneficiary's control of the documents for the purposes of giving discovery
of them (other than where the beneficiary physically possess them) is formally dependent
upon the exercise of the trustee's discretion to disclose the document to a beneficiary.197
Documents in the hands of the beneficiary obtained from the trustee in the course of or
as a result of a directions hearing under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 cannot
be disclosed by the beneficiary outside those proceedings (who will commit a contempt of
court) without the consent of the Jersey court.198
The usual order for discovery under r 6/17 RCR 2004 is for standard discovery although
the Court has discretion to make a wider order.199 Standard discovery is discovery of any

inspection but not discovery that fall within the recognised heads of privilege.201 An order
for specific discovery can be made by summons at any time and need not follow from deficiencies in the list.202 Discovery in Jersey is a continuing obligation on parties to litigation.203

D. Discovery and the Court's Inherent Supervisory Jurisdiction
The Royal Court has held that it may order the production of any document or information held by a trustee to any person under its inherent supervisory jurisdiction204 which
conceptually may fall outwith the scope of standard discovery. The converse is equally possible: there are categories of documents that the Court can be expected to refuse disclosure
of under the supervisory jurisdiction but which, if it falls within the scope of r.6/17, are
discoverable and cannot be withheld on the basis of their confidentiality.205 While confidentiality per se may be cited as a reason why the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction
to order the disclosure of a document under the supervisory jurisdiction, the confidentiality of a document (that is not privileged) is not usually a ground upon which the document
can be excluded from discovery or inspection.206

5-99

E. Discovery against Former Trustees and Non-parties
Jersey's Royal Court Rules, unlike the CPR,207 make no provision (other than certain limited exceptions) to seek discovery of documents as the sole basis for relief from a non-party
against whom no cause of action is alleged.208 An action may not be brought in Jersey
for discovery alone.209 Neither is it possible, save in limited circumstances, in the ordinary
course of civil proceedings to obtain discovery against a non-party.210 It is therefore necessary for a beneficiary to join former trustee's to proceedings in order to obtain discovery
of documents in their possession, custody or power that have not been transferred to the
incumbent trustees. The limited exceptions to the general prohibition against pre-action
discovery and discovery from non-parties that are recognised in Jersey in the context of

V. Disclosure of Evidence from Jersey in Support
of Foreign Proceedings
5-102

As an international finance centre, it is likely that a dispute involving a Jersey trust structure
may be litigated in a jurisdiction outside Jersey. Where the forum for litigation is a jurisdiction other than Jersey, it may be imperative to obtain evidence from non-party, Jersey-based
witnesses who have not or will not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court to give
evidence. The principal means by which this is achieved is by letters rogatory, more commonly referred to as letters of request. This section is dedicated to the Jersey procedure for
obtaining deposition and other evidence by means of letters of request from non-parties
in Jersey. In a civil litigation context, there are three important statutory regimes which
authorise and facilitate the taking of evidence within the island.215

A. Service of Process and Taking of Evidence (Jersey) Law 1960
('The 1960 Law')
5-103

The 1960 Law is the principal statute governing the mechanism by which requests for the
deposition of Jersey witnesses are directed to Jersey from foreign courts. The 1960 Law
allows Jersey to meet its obligations under the under the 1970 Convention on the Taking of

211 [1974] AC 133, [1980] 1 WLR 1275. The trend in the Jersey authorities has been to regard these 2 authorities
as based upon a single underlying doctrine; see Macdoel Invs Ltd v Brazil (Federal Republic) (n 177); New Media
Holding Co LLC v Capita Fiduciary Group Ltd (n 180).

Evidence abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (the Hague Evidence Convention).216 The
Royal Court has recently observed that there have been a number of practical changes in
the way letters of request are processed in Jersey since the 1960 Law and Service of Process
Rules 1994 were enacted which have not been reflected by amendments to the legislation.217
In this part is a procedural summary of how oral evidence may be obtained under the 1960
Law/The Hague Evidence Convention for use in foreign proceedings. However, this procedure also applies, mutatis mutandis, to requests emanating from non-Hague Evidence Convention jurisdictions218 and to those arising under the other enactments listed above.219
Part 2 of the Service of Process and Taking of Evidence (Jersey) Law 1960 provides for the
taking of evidence in Jersey in proceedings pending or in contemplation before courts outside the island (referred to as 'the requesting court'). The proceedings to which the request
relates must be related to civil or commercial matters220 arising in a court or tribunal having jurisdiction in the relevant country or territory.221 Where these criteria are met, the
requesting court may apply to the Royal Court222 for assistance in obtaining evidence. The
Royal Court is empowered with a wide discretion to make such provision for the obtaining of evidence in Jersey as may appear to it to be appropriate but may not make provision
beyond the terms of the 1960 Law.223 The relevance of evidence obtained under Articles 3
and 4 is to be adjudged under the law of the requesting court.224 Evidence will be relevant,
as per the Jersey test, if it makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable.225
The Royal Court has no power under the 1960 Law to accede to a request for it to conduct
its own factual investigation into matters regarding which the foreign court seeks evidence.
The Royal Court's procedure is adversarial and not inquisitorial.226 An order for judicial
216 The English equivalent of the 1960 Law, as amended, is the Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions)
Act 1975 with the equivalent procedural procedure set out in the now repealed RSC Ord 70 (CPR pt 34 and PD
34 r 6).

218 The signatories to the Hague Evidence Convention are: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Barbados,
Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Cyprus, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia,

Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, United States of America and Venezuela.
219 The 1960 Law as originally enacted and as preserved by the 1985 amendment (pt II, Art 3) permitted the
Royal Court to render discretionary assistance to any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction outside the Island.
Hence, such assistance may likewise be rendered to non-Convention countries though it is suggested that nonConvention countries might profitably apply Hague Convention requirements as a model.
220 Service of Process and Taking of Evidence (Jersey) Law 1960, Art 3(6). What is a civil or commercial matter
depends on a classification of those proceedings according to a combination of the law of the requesting court
and Jersey law. The Royal Court's jurisdiction under the 1960 Law (as the English High Court's jurisdiction under
the equivalent 1975 Act) was not affected by the rule that the English courts would not enforce an action for the
enforcement of a foreign revenue law, see Re State of Norway's Application (Nos 1 and 2) [1990] AC 723.
221 1960 Law, Art 3. In Wadman v Dick [1993 JLR 63], the Court concluded that foreign matrimonial proceedings fell within the ambit of civil matter, although the point does not appear to have been argued. The authorities
on s 1(b) of the 1975 Act are likely to be instructive in delineating the scope of civil or commercial matters in Jersey.
222 The Royal Court is the designated central authority in Jersey able to execute letters of request under Article 25
of the Hague Evidence Convention.

assistance cannot require any steps to be taken unless they could be required to be taken for
the purpose of obtaining evidence in civil proceedings in Jersey.227 As a matter of principle, the requested court should always strive to give effect to letters of request.228 It should
decline to comply with a foreign request only in so far as it was not proper or permissible
or practicable under its own law to give effect to it. It is not within the power of the Royal
Court to restructure, re-cast or re-phrase the letter of request (for example by changing the
description of categories of documents) so that it becomes different in substance from the
original request.229 The Court may only amend the request by excision, or by adding or
substituting words in order to clarify what is being sought without altering the substance
of the request.230

i. Issuing a Request to the Royal Court
5-105

When a foreign judicial authority has issued a letter of request, the letter should be remitted with the sealed, original order of the requesting court, usually via official channels,
to Jersey's Attorney General on behalf of the Royal Court. It is not a substantive basis of
objection to a letter of request that the request is not transmitted to the Royal Court via
the UK Home Office as per the Service of Process (Jersey) Rules 1994.231 The Law Officers' Department will advise whether it will progress the request within the Department or
whether outside legal representation from the Jersey bar must be engaged for this purpose.
A request that contains, for example, a short list of particular questions might be processed
entirely in-house by the Law Officers' Department whereas a request that requires the indepth examination of a witness is likely to need to be referred to a local legal practitioner.
The Law Officers' Department may also suggest whether a request needs refinement in any
way so as to comply with any of the necessary requirements.

ii. Contents of a Request
5-106

A letter of request should be in English or French (accompanied by an English translation)
and must specify:
1.
2.

the identity and address of the sender;
the foreign authority requesting its execution;
any date by which the request needs to be acted upon;

whether an interpreter will be required at the Jersey examination;
whether a sound recordist, shorthand-writer or transcriber will be required (or will be
provided by the requesting party);
what arrangements are to be made for the production of the transcript;
how the transcript is to be authenticated;
to whom the transcript is to be transmitted, and by what means;
whether the parties may be provided with a copy of the transcript; and
what privileges may be claimed by the witness in the requesting jurisdiction

A letter of request that is too widely drawn or strays into areas, access to which is forbidden
by the law of Jersey, may have those offending sections exercised.233

5-108

iii. Form and Execution of a Request
Subject to the mandatory contents set out above, a letter of request may be in such form
as the requesting court deems expedient. The Royal Court is itself likely to be flexible as to
the actual format of a letter of request, though of course such format may be prescribed
within the territory of the requesting court by regulations applicable there.234 Article 9 of
the Hague Convention requires letters of request to be executed expeditiously and in any
event, as already seen, the request should specify any date by which the transcript of evidence is sought.

232 Art 7 of the Hague Evidence Convention requires, upon request, notice of the time and place of the examination to be sent to the requesting authority, or direct to the parties, to enable the latter, or their representatives,
to be present. Under the Convention, such notice can, effectively, be given either by the Law Officers' Department or the Presiding Officer but, in practice, the Presiding Officer delegates any such duty to the parties' local
representative(s). See further para 5-114 below.

the examination of witnesses, either orally or in writing;
the production of documents;
the inspection or protection of any property;
the taking of property samples;
the medical examination of any person; and
the taking of blood samples from any person

However, an order made under the 1960 Law cannot require any steps to be taken in aid that
could not be taken in the context of civil proceedings in the Royal Court itself. But in acceding to a request under the 1960 Law, the Royal Court may permit a person to give evidence
other than on oath236 if this is sought by the requesting court.

v. Documents Disclosable
5-112

As in England and Wales, the discovery process in Jersey sets its face against 'fishing expeditions' and, as in England and Wales,237 but unlike many jurisdictions in the USA, pre-trial
discovery is not available in Jersey.238 It must be shown that the proposed witness who is
to give oral evidence has relevant evidence to give.239 If there was, on the evidence, sufficient ground for believing that the intended witness might have relevant evidence to give
on topics relevant to an issue in the action, there could be no objection on the grounds
that it was a 'fishing' exercise.240 An order made under the 1960 Law may not require a
person to state what relevant documents are, or have been, in his possession, custody or
power.241 He may only be required to produce particular documents specified in the order
as documents appearing to the Royal Court to be in his possession, custody or power.242
However, in a proper case, the Court may dispense with the statutory strictures of the 1960
Law and permit disclosure in its widest where, without discovery of the information in the

235

1960 Law, Art 4.
Evidence given viva voce in proceedings before the Royal Court is given on oath or by affirmation. (Note that
by Art 7 of the 1960 Law, it is however an offence to give false testimony when that testimony is given otherwise
than on oath.)

Goff of Chievley [1990] 1 AC at 810. In ratifying the 1970 Hague Convention, the UK declared, pursuant to Art 23,
that it would not execute letters of request issued for the purpose of obtaining pre-trial discovery of documents.

possession of the person against whom discovery was sought, no action could be begun
against a wrongdoer; and where such person had himself, albeit innocently, been involved
in the acts of the wrongdoer so as to facilitate them. In such circumstances, the Court
may order the person in possession of the documents to assist the person who had been
wronged by giving full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoer.243

vi. Summoning the Witness
By rule 6/20(8) RCR 2004, as amended, any party required to give evidence before the Royal
Court shall be summoned to appear at least two clear days (excluding Saturday, ­Sunday and
Public Holidays)244 before the day on which his appearance is required. In most cases, it
will thus be necessary to summon the witness through the Viscount's Officer (the Officer)
accordingly.245 The route of service of a summons to appear does not exclude the possibility of a witness attending to be examined by agreement, in which event counsel may
decide to forgo the formality (and protection) of issuing a summons. It is usually advisable
for counsel for the party at whose behest the request has been issued to confirm with any
witness, the witness' availability prior to issuing a summons. Clearly, a busy professional
person (for example, a banking officer) may well feel unable to prepare himself adequately
to give evidence and produce documents in a complicated commercial matter, within the
short period of notice allowable under rule 6/20(8) RCR 2004. A witness who finds himself unable reasonably to respond to the terms of a summons requiring him to attend for
examination may apply to the Presiding Officer for an adjournment of the examination.

5-113

vii. Record of Service
The witness having been duly summoned, the Viscount's official Record of Service will be
provided by the Viscount to the applicant party. The Record of Service should also be copied by the applicant party (or by the Viscount) to the Presiding Officer. Thereafter, parties'
representatives in the requesting jurisdiction are normally to be notified of the date fixed
for the Jersey examination, in accordance with the terms of the request. In practice, it is for
the parties' Jersey counsel to ensure that this notification takes place.

5-114

viii. Open or Closed Proceedings?
Notwithstanding that the examination of witnesses normally takes place in a courtroom, formally such proceedings take place in chambers and the public has no right of
­admission.246 It would be illogical if this were not so since such proceedings invariably
precede the trial of the issue in question in the country or territory of the requesting court.

245 The Viscount's Department should be told and provided with whatever documents are to be served along
with the summons: these might include a copy of the original order of the requesting court, the letter of request
and any questions that are disclosable to the witness beforehand.

Disclosure of Information and Documents

ix. Presiding Officer
5-116

Article 3(1) of the 1960 Law permits the Royal Court to appoint any person named in
its order to act as Presiding Officer. The Court may also sit as an examining body to take
evidence itself. In practice, the Royal Court normally appoints the Viscount or the Judicial Greffier (the Master) to take the examination of any witness required to give evidence
under the 1960 Law.247

x. Order and Exclusion of Witnesses
5-117

Where there is more than one witness to be examined the witnesses will be examined in the
order agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, in the order that the applicant party
requests. Upon the request of the applicant party, witnesses will be excluded from hearing
each other's testimony, in accordance with general principles in Jersey.

xi. Proceedings at the Examination
5-118

The form of the proceedings at which evidence is taken is to some extent determined by
the request for assistance. If a request which has been approved by the Royal Court simply
requires the witness to answer a number of particular questions (ie interrogatories248), then
the entire examination may be conducted by the Presiding Officer.249 However, much will
depend upon the requirements for the admission and proof of evidence in the requesting
court. As indicated, not all jurisdictions are dependent upon the processes of examinationin-chief, cross-examination and re-examination, which is the customary way of adducing
live evidence in Jersey (and in most common law jurisdictions): indeed, in foreign courts
that operate an inquisitorial model, the Court alone questions the witness. In any event, the
parties to foreign litigation often wish to be present when evidence is taken in Jersey and the
customary approach is the one most commonly adopted.

xii. Who May Appear to Conduct the Examination of Witnesses?
5-119

In Wigley & Ors v Dick,250 contrary to the then practice whereby only a Jersey advocate
could appear before the Bar of the Royal Court, foreign counsel was authorised to appear
before the Viscount, as Presiding Officer, in order personally to conduct the examination
of Jersey witnesses. Foreign counsel, who will often have conduct of the matter before the
requesting court, have frequently availed themselves of this option since. However, it is
usually advisable for a Jersey advocate or solicitor also to be present so as to introduce the
proceedings to the Presiding Officer and to deal with any aspects of Jersey law or procedure which may arise. However, foreign counsel may not appear when the Royal Court,
rather than the Viscount, sits to take evidence at the request of a foreign court for use
in ­proceedings.251 Neither is foreign counsel permitted to appear before the Bar to argue
objections taken by a witness to answering questions.
247

RCR 2004, r 17.3(g).

248 A request seeking authority to ask particular questions should always seek to include a more general power

of examination in relation to such questions. Such a facility would specifically enable background and supplementary issues also to be explored at least to a limited extent.

xiii. Compellability of Witnesses
A witness formally and properly summoned to appear to give evidence is bound to comply
with the terms of the summons served upon him, anyone competent to give evidence under
Jersey law being generally compellable to do so. However, it should be borne in mind that,
albeit rarely, certain categories of witness-such as a spouse of an accused party in criminal
proceedings, those holding information the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to
State security252 or, it seems, even the Jersey Comptroller of Income Tax253-may actually
be non-compellable as a matter of Jersey law, or may seek to establish such a claim either
before the Royal Court or the Presiding Officer. Any such matter should always be resolved
prior to the hearing before the Presiding Officer. If the parties are unable to resolve the
issue themselves, the practice is for the Presiding Officer to refer any such application to
the Royal Court.

5-120

xiv. Objections to Answering Questions
When a compellable witness is giving evidence pursuant to an order made under the 1960
Law, such witness cannot be compelled to give any evidence which he could not be compelled to give in civil proceedings in the island or in such proceedings in the country or territory in which the requesting court exercises jurisdiction.254 Such privilege is not claimable
unless the claim to it is either supported by a statement contained in the request itself or is
conceded by the applicant party. Nonetheless, Article 4 permits the taking of the evidence
provisionally where neither avenue is available (the witness answers the questions put to
him but the requesting court is left to decide upon the validity of the objection and the
admissibility of the evidence in the requesting court). The practical result of the protection
given by Article 4(3) is that a witness will normally be able to claim both a privilege against
self-incrimination and legal professional privilege. It is axiomatic that outside the scope of
the 1960 Law, a Jersey witness will in any event be able to claim both privileges from the
standpoint of domestic procedure in Jersey; and, on the same basis, he will also be able to
claim objection to answering questions on the grounds of irrelevance and unwarranted
breach of third party confidentiality.255 The basis for objection is not limited to information protected by legal privilege but includes requests that are oppressive, that, if answered,
would breach confidentiality or the answer to which is irrelevant.256 The confidentiality of
information is not, per se, a bar to it being disclosed pursuant to the 1960 Law. The value in
preserving confidential information is to be weighed in the balance with the information's
financial importance to the party in the requesting court.257 When any privilege or objection is claimed or raised by a witness during the course of his examination, the Presiding
Officer has no power to direct the witness to answer the question. Neither is the Viscount
empowered to accede to or determine any privilege or objection raised by the witness, the
witness is able to make such objections as it pleases and the procedure is for the Presiding
Officer to make a note of the claim or objection and the ground for it. If necessary, the

indeed answer the question in issue.258 The Royal Court retained the right, in support of
civil proceedings, on completion of the examination, to compel a witness to answer a question to which objection is taken.259 Foreign counsel may not argue objections before Royal
Court.260

xv. Representation of the Witness
5-122

Contrary to the usual rule in Jersey civil proceedings whereby a witness who is not a party is
not entitled to have their counsel present during their examination, a witness summonsed
pursuant to a letter of request may be represented by counsel. If this right were not accorded
to the witness it might well be impossible for a witness properly to raise claims of privilege
or objection to answering questions. Such a situation would entail unfairness to the witness
and impose an undesirable burden on the Presiding Officer who would be the only person
left to protect the witness. Nonetheless, a witness' counsel's function is purely protective: it
is not open to the witness to confer with, or seek advice from their counsel as to how the
witness should answer the questions put to him.261 Neither is it appropriate for counsel for
the witness to raise questions relating to the validity of the Act of the Royal Court. The Presiding Officer will not go behind an Act of the Royal Court and enquire into its validity.262
All such questions should either be raised with the Royal Court or resolved between counsel
for the parties and for the witness prior to the examination.

xvi. Recording and Transcribing Evidence
5-123

The normal mode of adducing evidence before the Royal Court is by oral examination. The
usual method of recording such evidence in Jersey is by tape recording. It follows that the
evidence of witnesses heard before the Presiding Officer pursuant to a letter of request will
generally be so recorded by the Royal Court. In ordinary circumstances, those staff would
also provide a transcription service. However, circumstances may arise in which it is beyond
the resources of the Royal Court to provide a transcription service when acting in aid of a
requesting court. In such circumstances and in others, such as where the transcript of the
proceedings is urgently required, the usual available alternatives are that:
1.

the Royal Court will provide a sound recording service only. Copy tapes will then be
sent to transcription specialists in England; or
the parties to the proceedings themselves engage a specialist stenographer (if necessary
utilising a Computer Aided Transcription System-which would provide for the production of an instantaneous transcription).

2.

5-124

The present position is that a letter of request must specifically request for proceedings
before the Presiding Officer to be video-taped and such request is always subject to the
discretion of the Presiding Officer. Circumstances may arise where the requesting court

seeks the supply of both a video-tape and a written transcript of the Jersey proceedings.
This is the standard procedure applied in England and Wales. It will be apparent that other
than in cases where the Royal Court has found it possible to provide a sound recording and
transcription service in-house (where specified fees will apply) all disbursements relating to
providing any of the alternative services mentioned will be payable by the applicant party.

xvii. Privacy and 'Gagging' Orders
The examination of witnesses pursuant to the 1960 Law takes place in private.263 However,
in appropriate circumstances privacy and 'gagging' orders will be obtainable in Jersey (for
example) to prevent the witness from disclosing to any party that he has been subjected
to examination in Jersey. Such an order can also extend to preventing the unauthorised
use, copying or dissemination of the transcript of the Jersey proceedings. In re C Ltd264
information disclosed to the Royal Court but deemed to be otherwise confidential was
withheld from persons convened to give evidence in an application arising under Article 48
of the 1990 Law. All such requests should be included in the letter of request. There have
been cases where it has been suggested that an order made by the Royal Court preventing
unauthorised copying or dissemination of the content of a Jersey examination may be subsequently disregarded in that the content of the Jersey examination becomes public domain
material once introduced into the proceedings in the requesting court. It is submitted that
this is a specious argument. Orders of the Royal Court should be complied with even if they
are difficult to enforce in the territory of the requesting court. Impliedly, it is a condition of
the grant of assistance by the Royal Court to the requesting court that orders of the Royal
Court will be respected within the territory of the requesting court. The correct procedure
in circumstances such as those outlined is for Jersey counsel to make an application to the
Royal Court seeking a variation of any confidentiality order earlier made by it. Leaving
aside the question of enforceability, should such an order of the Royal Court be ignored
within the territory of the requesting court, such conduct might well be taken into account
in any subsequent application to the Royal Court from a court in the requesting territory.

5-125

xviii. Completion of Testimony
Normally, the completion of a witness' examination serves to finalise his testimony. However, circumstances may arise in which it may be preferable for counsel to seek to reserve
before the Presiding Officer any purported rights of further examination and recall: in such
circumstances, it may be prudent for counsel to ask for the examination to stand adjourned
sine die rather than for his evidence to be acknowledged as complete.

5-126

xix. Signing and Transmission of the Deposition
Subject to any special requirements of the requesting court, once the witness has approved
the transcript of his evidence he will be required to appear before the Presiding Officer
in chambers to authenticate the transcript by signing it. The Presiding Officer will then

countersign the deposition in the presence of the witness. Counsel are not normally present
when a deposition is authenticated in this way though they will usually have been provided
with a draft for information. In cases where a witness becomes unavailable to authenticate
his deposition it may be authenticated under the hand of the Presiding Officer alone. It is
generally agreed that the parties and/or the witness may be provided with and retain copies
of the authenticated transcript. Once authenticated, the original deposition will be transmitted to the requesting court by the means specified in the letter of request.

xx. Costs
5-128

When witnesses are being examined in Jersey in a civil or commercial matter it is not appropriate for the Presiding Officer, or even the Royal Court, to make any order as to costs inter
partes. These will in all cases fall to be determined subsequently by the requesting court.265
However, the Presiding Officer has the power266 to make provision for the reimbursement
of, for example, fees paid to experts, interpreters and the expenses of any special procedure
adopted when rendering assistance to the requesting court. Further, under Article 26 of the
Hague Convention fees and costs incurred in connection with the execution of letters of
request, the service of process necessary to compel the attendance of a witness, the costs
of attendance of any such witness and the cost of any transcript of evidence are likewise
reimbursable. Circumstances may arise in which additional expenditure may have to be
incurred within the context of the Jersey proceedings so as to enable those proceedings to
actually take place: these may arise, for example, where copy tapes are to be sent to transcription specialists in England or where the parties have agreed to engage a specialist
stenographer. All these expenses would appear to be reimbursable under Article 26. By
­virtue of Articles 14 and 26 it is the requesting state of origin which is technically bound
to make the reimbursements. However, in practice, it is clear that the parties must agree to
discharge these disbursements before they can be incurred and, indeed, the Act of the Royal
Court authorising the taking of evidence in Jersey will have made necessary provision for
the discharge of the Presiding Officer's disbursements.

xxi. Witnesses' Allowances and Expenses
5-129

Apart from the provision under Article 26 of the Hague Convention providing for the reimbursement of witnesses' costs, attendance allowances and expenses unavoidably incurred
in giving evidence in the context of civil proceedings of which a requesting court is seized,
these will only be reclaimable by a witness to the extent that a witness in civil proceedings
before the Royal Court would be able to claim similar payment.267 However, in our opinion
this right will not extend to the repayment of counsel's fee when he appears in representation of a witness since counsel's fee would not be an unavoidable consequence of the witness' attendance. It is recommended that the appropriate party should agree proposals for
discharging the allowances and expenses of a witness without the involvement of the Royal
Court or the Presiding Officer so as to obviate the need for ancillary applications in the
context of the Jersey proceedings.

B. Bankers' Books Evidence (Jersey) Law 1986 ('The 1986 Law')
Under the 1986 Law a bank, or officer of a bank, shall not, in any legal proceedings to which
the bank is not a party, be compellable to produce any bankers' book, unless by order of
the Royal Court made for special cause.268 Nonetheless, on the application of any party to a
legal proceeding the Royal Court may order that such party be at liberty to inspect and take
copies of any entries in a bankers' book for any of the purposes of such proceedings.269 In a
civil matter an application for such an order must be made by summons served on the bank
and on the other party, supported by an affidavit showing the materiality of the inspection
and demonstrating that the application is made in good faith.270 While the 1986 Law seems
to have been implemented largely with Jersey proceedings in mind, legal proceeding are
defined in the 1986 Law as meaning any civil or criminal proceeding or enquiry in which
evidence is, or may be given anywhere in the world, and includes an arbitration. It follows
that an application for the production of bankers' book evidence in Jersey can be made to the
Royal Court by a party to foreign proceedings or by a foreign court under the terms of the
1986 Law. The power of the Royal Court under Article 6 of the 1986 Law is, along with
the closely aligned principles applicable to the grant of an application for Norwich Pharmacal
relief, entirely discretionary and will in all cases be exercised with caution, and only on the
clearest grounds.

C. Discovery of Documents and Information Ordered in Support of
Foreign Insolvency Matters
The Royal Court has a discretionary power to render assistance to prescribed foreign courts
in matters of insolvency.271 However the Royal Court remains free to exercise an inherent
jurisdiction to assist non-prescribed countries, outside the application of Article 49 of the
Désastre Law. The Court will exercise its discretion in accordance with the principles of
comity and should therefore be willing to grant assistance where there is evidence of reciprocity from the courts of the foreign state.272 Implicitly, foreign insolvency or bankruptcy
matters do fall within the definition of a civil or commercial matter for the purposes of the
1960 Law. Although it has been held in England that the UK equivalent of the 1960 Law, the
Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act 1975, is inapplicable where the foreign
proceedings are in the nature of bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings, as the evidence
sought by way of the 1975 Act must be sought for trial and not some interlocutory proceeding and in the context of an insolvency, there would never be a trial in the English sense,273
applications for assistance under Article 49 are made by way of ex parte Representation

before the usual Friday afternoon sitting of the Samedi Division of the Royal Court.274 It
follows that where litigation arises in the context of foreign insolvency or bankruptcy matters that is pending or in contemplation before a court outside Jersey, evidence for use in
those proceedings could be obtained in Jersey (as the assistance rendered) pursuant to the
procedure described above in relation to letters of request under the 1960 Law. Assistance in
the context of Article 49 is wider than the provision of disclosure or evidence in support of
foreign proceedings.275 In granting such assistance the Royal Court may exercise, in relation
to the matters to which the request relates, any jurisdiction which it or the requesting court
could exercise in relation to those matters.276 An applicant for an order for assistance from
the Royal Court in insolvency and bankruptcy matters under Article 49 should consult with
the Viscount's Department with a view to ensuring that the order sought, while seeking to
achieve the objects of the letter of request, is drawn in terms suited to Jersey's domestic
bankruptcy legislation.277 Unlike under the 1960 Law, the Law Officers' Department does
not usually act as a conduit in relation to insolvency requests under Article 48 and all such
applications should be remitted directly to a Jersey lawyer to be progressed. Applications
for assistance under Article 49 are made by way of ex parte Representation before the usual
Friday afternoon sitting of the Samedi Division of the Royal Court.
The fact of the request for assistance is a weighty factor to be taken into account in granting the assistance sought.278 That said, a request cannot be conclusive as to the manner in
which the Royal Court's discretion should be exercised, notwithstanding that the foreign
court is likely to be in a better position to state what is required for the proper conduct of
a bankruptcy or winding up in its own jurisdiction. It will not normally be appropriate
for the Court to inquire into the basis for the views expressed by the foreign court making
the request but there is no reason to prevent its considering events subsequent to the letter
of request in the exercise of its discretion whether to and the manner in which the Royal
Court's discretion is to be exercised.279
The power of the Court to render assistance under Article 49 is limited by the rules of
private international law. It is therefore unlikely that the Royal Court will render extensive assistance in relation to, for example, a foreign 'revenue' insolvency.280 Assistance will
not, be granted if the foreign Revenue is the sole creditor but it may be granted if there is
another ordinary creditor who would benefit thereby, regardless of the size of the ordinary
creditor's claim in relation to that of the foreign Revenue authority.281
Subject to this caveat, it follows that in the context of a foreign insolvency, witnesses in
Jersey may be examined in aid of the foreign insolvency office holder in carrying out his

duties. While such an examination would conform, broadly speaking, to the requirements
set out in relation to the procedure under the 1960 Law, a Jersey examination in aid of a
foreign insolvency may range over a broader topic area. In a domestic insolvency in Jersey

available for more confined usage (in effectively locating, protecting and realising assets)
rather than being readily available or relevant for use in any subsequent or connected court

Trusts Arising by Operation of Law:
Resulting and Constructive Trusts
I. Introduction
This chapter is concerned with the creation of trusts which are not express trusts, created
by a settlor evincing an express or inferred intention of creating a trust whether by way of
a declaration of trust, by will or by disposition of property to trustees. Resulting and constructive trusts, especially the latter, are recognised as arising in Jersey law in a wide variety
of circumstances. The recognition and adoption of constructive trusts in Jersey law has
been primarily as a tool to thwart attempts by wrongdoers to safe harbour their nefariously
obtained gains.1 In crafting its own response to dealing with this problem, the Royal Court
has drawn from jurisprudence developed in English law and from other leading Commonwealth jurisdictions. However, the circumstances in which English law will recognise
a constructive trust arising are not wholly mirrored in Jersey law. Owing to the Norman
customary law principles that underpin the island's law of real property, wholly absent from
Jersey's jurisprudence is any equivalent of the rich seam of English case law concerning
common-intention constructive trusts that has come to govern the rights of co-owners of
immovable property. Resulting trusts are recognised in Jersey as being founded on the basis
of a presumed (but rebuttable) intention on the part of the transferor or purchaser of property not to relinquish beneficial ownership in respect of it. Many of the Jersey cases on constructive trusts, on the other hand, are concerned with a situation where a trust is imposed
on a person holding property usually against his actual intention.2 A constructive trust is
imposed by the law in circumstances in which the law requires the holder of the property
not to retain it for their own benefit and deny the interests of the true beneficiaries.3

II. Constructive Trusts and Constructive Trusteeship
A comprehensive definition of the constructive trust in Jersey law is an elusive creature and,
as in many jurisdictions that recognise the concept, there is no single unifying principle

that runs through all the c­ ategories of constructive trust or the circumstances in which the
Court will declare a constructive trust to have arisen.4 Article 33 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984 defines a constructive trustee in the following terms:

Subject to paragraph (2), where a person (in this Article referred to as a constructive trustee)
makes or receives any profit, gain or advantage from a breach of trust the person shall be
deemed to be a trustee of that profit, gain, or advantage.
Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a bona fide purchaser of property for value and without
notice of a breach of trust.
A person who is or becomes a constructive trustee shall deliver up the property of which the
person is a constructive trustee to the person properly entitled to it.
This Article shall not be construed as excluding any other circumstances under which a person may be or become a constructive trustee.

As is apparent from the article itself this is not an exhaustive description of the circumstances giving rise to a constructive trust in Jersey nor is it exhaustive of the circumstances in which a person will be described as a constructive trustee. While in a number
of instances, the circumstances in which a constructive trust will arise will fall within the
ambit of ­Article 33, in others recourse of customary law principles is necessary to fill the
gap.5 The intervention of the law by the imposition of a constructive trust is based on
principle not the free-wheeling discretion of the Court to achieve justice as it sees fit. There
is a close correlation between the imposition of a constructive trust and unconscionable
conduct, the former giving rise to the latter, so that the holder of the property subject to
the constructive trust is prevented from asserting a beneficial interest in the assets in his
hands to the exclusion of the of the true beneficial owner.6 This can be contrasted with
the jurisprudence in the United States and Canada, where the basis for the imposition of
a constructive trust appears to be to prevent unjust enrichment.7 However, the distinction
between unconscionability and unjust enrichment as a basis for the imposition of a constructive trust may be more apparent than real, as the enrichment is usually only unjust if
it is unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefit received.8 The events giving rise
to a constructive trust must be known to the person alleged to be a constructive trustee.
The conscience of the defendant being affected is of central importance to the imposition
of a constructive trust. While unconscionability may be the benchmark, the imposition of a
constructive trust does not have anything to do with punishing the holder of the property
for wrongdoing.
There are two recognised categories of constructive trust and constructive trusteeship recognised in Jersey law. The categorisation has been adopted in Jersey from English authority which identified two meanings to the term 'constructive trust' for the purposes of

5 As is evident, Art 33 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 does not encompass a dishonest assistant, who is conven-

tionally described as being liable to account as a constructive trustee, although as will be seen, that description is
not necessarily apposite.

­limitation.9 Both categories of constructive trust recognised in Jersey are based upon the
existence of a fiduciary relationship (to which the defendant constructive trustee may or
may not be a party). Jersey law recognises certain well-established categories of relationship
as fiduciary, for example trustee and beneficiary, director and company, agent and principal.
However it has been recognised that the categories of fiduciary relationship are not closed.
The categorisation of constructive trusts that has become accepted in Jersey is between a
constructive trust arising by operation of law based upon a pre-existing fiduciary relationship that is independent of any breach of trust or fiduciary duty giving rise to the constructive trust (known as a 'Type-1' constructive trust) and the imposition of a personal liability
to 'account as a constructive trustee' by way of a remedy (known as a 'Type-2' constructive
trustee) where there is no pre-existing fiduciary relationship and liability 'as a constructive
trustee' arises simultaneously with the acts giving rise to liability.

6-5

A. Fiduciary Relationships
As with the nature of a constructive trust itself, there is no single unifying definition of a
fiduciary in Jersey law. A working definition of what a fiduciary is, is that given by Millett LJ
in Mothew v Bristol & West Building Society:10

6-6

A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing
obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty.

The search for a single, conclusive definition of a fiduciary remains elusive.11 The best that
can be achieved is to define the characteristics of a fiduciary relationship. Not all fiduciary
relationships give rise to the same fiduciary duties (or for that matter remedies for breach
of those duties). There are three broad kinds of fiduciary relationship (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive) each exhibiting different characteristics: (1) relationships of trust
and confidence,12 the core obligation in this kind of fiduciary relationship being one of
loyalty; (2) relationships of influence;13 and (3) relationships of confidence.
These broad descriptions of different types of relationship will assist in identifying the
characteristics of a relationship that will convert an otherwise arm's length or commercial
relationship into a fiduciary relationship. Where one party to a relationship places themselves in a position in which they are unable to prefer their own interest to the interests of
the other person, they will have become a fiduciary in relation to that person. Outside a
handful of archetypal examples of fiduciary relationships, the paradigm example being that

they are obliged to do so. The core obligation is one of loyalty.

Resulting and Constructive Trusts

between a trustee and beneficiary,14 the Court is usually reluctant to impute to a person that
they have assumed a fiduciary relationship generally in favour of another person in respect
of the whole course of dealing between them.

B. Personal and Proprietary Remedies
6-9

6-10

6-11

In response to a breach of fiduciary duty, the law is not primarily concerned to compensate for any loss caused (although it will try to do so).15 Instead its primary concern is to
treat the defaulting fiduciary as though they were still compliant with their duties. The
mechanism by which that is achieved is by way of an account of profits, which requires the
fiduciary to disclose and pay over all profits arising from the breach.16 A fiduciary's personal obligation to account affords the beneficiaries of that duty no priority as against the
fiduciary's personal creditors in the event of the fiduciary's insolvency. The imposition of a
constructive trust will give rise, at least, to a personal liability upon the constructive trustee
to account to those for whom they are a constructive trustee. In certain circumstances, the
law will recognise the imposition of a constructive trust giving rise to a proprietary remedy
in favour of the victim of the breach of fiduciary duty.
The paradigm cases in which a proprietary constructive trust will arise over property is
in circumstances where property is transferred to be held by a fiduciary who holds it as
a fiduciary, either for the transferor of for beneficiaries (in the case of an express trust).
A superficially different situation, but in which the result is the same, is where the asset that
is transferred to a fiduciary is substituted by the fiduciary for another asset. The basis upon
which a proprietary constructive trust in the substituted asset arises involves a resorting to
the principles of tracing.17 It is uncontroversial that the basis on which a constructive trust
arises is on the ownership of the original asset entitling the plaintiff to assert beneficial
ownership in the traceable substitute asset.
The issue of central importance between the availability of a proprietary as opposed to a
personal remedy against a constructive trustee is the defendant's solvency. If the constructive trustee is sufficiently solvent to satisfy the beneficiaries' claim, there is usually no need
to assert a proprietary claim to the assets. However, where the solvency or the ability of
the constructive trustee to otherwise satisfy a personal claim is in issue, the beneficiaries
should insist upon their proprietary entitlement to the assets. In circumstances where the
constructive trust arises from a fraud or theft (which has been the factual scenario in a
number of the leading Jersey authorities on the nature of constructive trusts) there is likely
to be an insufficiency of assets for the defendant constructive trustee to be able to satisfy all
personal claims against him. Assets in the hands of a constructive trustee that are subject
14 The other archetypal examples being the relationship between agent and principal (FHR LLP v Cedar Capital
LLC [2014] UKSC 45); director and company (Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1991] 2 AC at 565; In Re Esteem
Settlement (n 1)); solicitor and client (Hirschfield v Philip Sinel & Co [1999 JLR 55]; Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG
[1999] 2 AC at 235-36); partnerships (Cannon v Nichol [2006 JLR 299]); and, possibly, parties to a joint venture
(although whether a fiduciary relationship exists is likely to be a question of fact in each case and is not to be
judged simply and solely by reference to the existence of the relationship alone).

Constructive Trusts

to a proprietary ­constructive trust are set apart from the assets beneficially owned by the
defendant constructive trustee. A proprietary claim will therefore survive the insolvency of
the constructive trustee and the assets subject to a constructive trust will not fall into a pari
passu division of the assets beneficially owned by the defendant trustee. Put another way,
the plaintiff will maintain priority against the body of the constructive trustee's u
­ nsecured
creditors to the extent of the asset over which a proprietary interest is claimed. One of
the benefits of being able to assert a proprietary remedy against assets in the hands of a
constructive trustee is that the plaintiff is entitled to any uplift in value the asset has gone
through since it became subject to the constructive trust. In contrast, save for the possible
award of interest, a beneficiary asserting a personal claim against a constructive trustee is
usually for a fixed sum, representing the plaintiff 's loss. Another consequence of a proprietary remedy is that it widens the potential number of claims that may be brought, beyond
the constructive trustee; for example, against accessories who knowingly receive the traceable proceeds of the original breach of trust or fiduciary duty or who dishonestly assist
in any further failure of the original constructive trustee to account.18 The trust property
remains traceable against any person into whose hands the trust property comes, who is not
a bona fides purchaser for value.

C. Type-1 Constructive Trustees: 'True' or 'Institutional'
Constructive Trustees
The defining feature of cases in which a Type-1 constructive trusteeship arises is that the
defendant constructive trustee has already accepted or assumed the role of a trustee or a
fiduciary independently of and preceding the acts giving rise to liability. The imposition of
a constructive trust vindicates the rights of those to whom the constructive trustee already
owes fiduciary duties. A Type-1 constructive trusteeship arises from the date of the circumstances giving rise to it; the function of the Court is to declare that such a trust has arisen
in the past; the constructive trust is institutional and does not arise at the discretion of the
Court.19 A Type-1 constructive trustee is not permitted to receive the property in his own
right, the transaction by which he comes by the property is deemed to create a trust from
the outset and the trustee's possession of the property is coloured by his pre-existing fiduciary relationship by which he obtained it. The law treats a Type-1 constructive trustee as
holding the property concerned on trust for the plaintiff and the plaintiff is usually entitled
to assert a proprietary remedy against the traceable assets in the hands of the constructive
trustee.
The recognised categories of fiduciary relationship capable of giving rise to a Type-1 constructive trust are those where the defendant constructive trustee has already willingly
assumed a fiduciary position. The archetypal example is that of an express trustee but
also includes a person purportedly exercising the office of trustee even though improperly
appointed (a trustee de son tort) or a person recognised to exercise another fiduciary office,

analogous to that of a trustee, such as the director of a company. A trustee de son tort
is a treated as administering the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust
notwithstanding their improper appointment. A director of a company, unlike either an
express trustee or a trustee de son tort, is not usually vested with the company's property,
but will have de facto control over the company's assets and so is in an analogous position
to a trustee in respect of that property, being accountable to their company, being in a
position of trust and confidence to their company, being subject to similar rules as trustee
concerning unauthorised profits at the expense of their company, conflicts of interest and
self-dealing and otherwise dealing with the assets to the detriment of their company. In
each of these examples the imposition of a constructive trust bars the fiduciary from claiming the property subject to the trust beneficially; the trust ensures the fiduciary's treatment
of the property subject to the constructive trust is consistent with their existing duties.

i. Unauthorised Gains by a Fiduciary and their Proceeds
6-14

6-15

A Jersey trustee, is not permitted to make a personal gain during the course of their trusteeship without the express authorisation of the beneficiaries, the Court, the terms of the trust
instrument or the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.20 This rule applies irrespective of whether there
has been a misuse of trust property (ie a misappropriation of trust assets for the benefit of
the trustee or a third party) or where the trustee (or other fiduciary in an analogous position to a trustee, such as a company director or agent) has otherwise abused his position,
for example by receiving a bribe or secret commission21 by appropriating for themselves
an opportunity which comes to the fiduciary in that capacity. As is explored elsewhere, this
rule is applied strictly and irrespective of whether the trustee or fiduciary has acted in good
faith, that the gain would not have accrued to the beneficiaries, that the fiduciary has not
caused an actionable loss, or that the gain was obtained by reason of the fiduciary's own
skills.22 This rule operates to prevent temptation on the part of the fiduciary by automatically appropriating to the beneficiaries the trustee's unauthorised gains and the traceable
proceeds deriving from them.
Self-evidently, a trustee is not liable to account as a constructive trustee (whether on a personal or proprietary basis) for every gain that accrues to him. When it comes to identifying the gain for which the constructive trustee must account, the Court will usually allow
a deduction for the trustee's reasonable costs and expenses in maintaining the gain. Put
another way, the trustee is liable for his net profits not its gross receipts.23 The defendant is
only liable for gains which have been made in his capacity as a fiduciary or by virtue of that
fiduciary position. The plaintiff must establish the exact nature and extent of the fiduciary's
obligations before it is able to lay claim to the gain by way of a proprietary claim or obtain

an account of it from the defendant. In cases where the fiduciary duties derive from a particular status, such as a trustee, this is uncontroversial. In other cases, where the fiduciary's
status and the scope of his obligations arise from a fact-specific context the position is not
as straightforward.
The test of causation, whereby the Court is able to establish a sufficient connection between
the breach of duty and the profit or gain derived, is that applicable to any other breach of
trust by a trustee.24 The breach must have been the cause of the gain. The breach need not
have been the sole cause, nor need it have been the predominant cause.25 The defaulting
fiduciary is unable to escape liability for the gain on the basis that he would have made the
gain even if there had been no breach of duty.26 The burden is on the defaulting fiduciary
to show that the profit is not one for which he should account.27 In effect, this means that
once the plaintiff has discharged the burden of proof that there has been a breach of the
fiduciary's duty, the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove that the breach of duty had no
causative effect at all and that any gain in his hands came exclusively as a result of activities
legitimately undertaken on his own account.28

ii. Constructive Trusts Arising from a Breach of Confidence
Information coming to a fiduciary in the course of his office is not the property of the
trust or principal to whom the fiduciary duty is owed, and may be used by the trustee for
his own benefit or the benefit of other trusts unless the information is confidential, ie it is
given to the trustee in circumstances which, regardless of his position as a trustee, would
make it a breach of confidence for him to communicate to anyone for it has been given to
him expressly or impliedly as confidential, or alternatively in a fiduciary capacity, and its
use would place him in a position where his duty and his interest might possibly conflict.29
An obligation of confidence arises where a person receives confidential information in the
knowledge that it is to be kept confidential. A breach of confidence arises where information that has the necessary quality of confidentiality is imparted in circumstances importing
an obligation of confidence and there has been an unauthorised use of the information.30
Where a trustee of two settlements, the A Trust and the B Trust, holds shares in the same
small company, and the trustee learns facts qua trustee of the A Trust about the company
which are encouraging, in the absence of special circumstances (such as, for example, that
the A Trust wants to buy more shares) there is nothing in principle that makes it improper
for the trustee to tell his co-trustees of the B Trust who feel inclined to sell, that the trustee
has information that this would be a bad thing to do because the shares in the company

are likely to appreciate in value. However, where, as trustee of the A Trust, the trustee learns
facts that make him and his co-trustees want to sell the shares, clearly the trustee could not
communicate this knowledge to his co-trustees of B Trust until the holdings of the A Trust
in the company have been sold. To share that information would amount to an obvious
conflict, reflected in the prices that might or might possibly be obtained.
Article 31(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides that where a trustee acts as trustee for more than one trust, it shall not, in the absence of fraud, be affected by notice of
any instrument, matter, fact or thing in relation to any particular trust if the trustee has
obtained notice of it by reason of the trustee's acting or having acted for the purposes of
another trust. We do not regard this provision as deviating from the principle espoused in
the examples of the A and B Trust given above. The trustee of Trust A may share information with himself or his co-trustees of another trust if doing so would be beneficial, but is
not obliged to do so and cannot be held at fault by the beneficiaries for having failed to do
so or to take advantage of confidential information of which he has notice or has otherwise
obtained qua trustee of the A Trust.
Where a trustee is possessed of confidential information, he is not permitted to make use of
it to the prejudice of the person from whom the information was received in confidence or
to whom the duty of confidence is owed without their consent.31 If the trustee or fiduciary
does breach his duty of confidence and makes a profit or gain from the information, the
trustee must account for the profits obtained.32 There is as yet no Jersey authority in which
the Court has imposed a proprietary constructive trust over the profits obtained by a fiduciary in breach of confidence and the Royal Court has yet to declare whether confidential
information is property, whether a relationship of confidence is fiduciary, or whether a
plaintiff is restricted to a loss-based remedy for damages, rather than a proprietary one.33

iii. Constructive Trusts Arising on the Taking of a Corporate Opportunity
6-21

Unlike in cases where it is possible to identify that the property sought to be subject to
a proprietary remedy is either the original property or its traceable proceeds,34 in cases
where a fiduciary, such as a director, has taken an opportunity for himself which should
have been obtained for the benefit of his company, there is usually no pre-existing ownership in the asset by the principal to whom the duty is owed. Take a case where a director
of a property development company, on becoming informed of a sale of land, acquires the
land for himself and does not afford the company for whom he is a director the possibility
of considering the opportunity; the opportunity of which the company has been deprived
would not have appeared in the company's books or financial records, nor would it have

been something that the company was capable of offering as security for its borrowing. It
is now clear35 that a proprietary claim will arise in respect of a profit or gain obtained by a
fiduciary taking advantage of his position as a fiduciary which is the crucial factor and not
whether the opportunity could be described as somehow being the property or belonging
to the principal. The fiduciary is estopped from denying that he acquired such assets on
behalf of the person to whom the fiduciary owes his duty.36 Is it not a requirement that
the advantage or opportunity that is taken includes a misappropriation of an asset that in
fact belongs to the principal.37 It includes all opportunities which present themselves to the
fiduciary in that capacity and in respect of which he is obliged to consider the interests of
those to whom he owes his duties as a fiduciary in preference to his own interests.

iv. Constructive Trusts Arising over Bribes and Secret Commissions
There is no point paying a bribe or secret commission to a person who is not in a position
to give effect to or influence a particular outcome. It follows that a fiduciary who receives
a bribe or secret commission does so precisely because they are in a fiduciary position. It
is in the nature of a bribe or secret commission to induce the recipient to do something
they would not otherwise have done, contrary to their duties. It therefore follows that the
principles applicable to a case where a fiduciary has received a bribe or secret commission
are closely aligned with those applicable to cases in which the fiduciary has deprived their
principal of a corporate opportunity. A fiduciary who receives a bribe or secret commission
has profited from his office, giving rise to a constructive trust over the sums received or
their traceable proceeds.38 It follows that there is no difference in principle between cases
where a benefit is obtained by the fiduciary which the fiduciary was bound to obtain for
their principal (and which the law vindicates by the imposition of a constructive trust over
the benefit, as if the fiduciary had performed their duty) and cases where the benefit was
never supposed to have been obtained at all, ie cases of bribes and secret commissions.39

Where property is wrongfully transferred by a trustee or other fiduciary to a third party in

claim against the trustee, the original beneficial interest in the misdirected property subsists
and the misdirected property remains unless and until the property comes to be transferred
to a bona fides purchaser for value without notice.40 The trust to which the property that

has been wrongfully transferred attaches is often described as a constructive trust; however,
what the law imposes is not truly a new trust but a recognition of the old trust to which
the property, notwithstanding the breach, remains subject.41 While a third party may have
trust property transferred to them in breach of trust, it does not follow that the third party's
receipt gives rise to any personal liability to account for the property to the plaintiff beneficiaries. Such personal liability to account arises only where the receiving party is or becomes
sufficiently cognisant of the breach of trust to render their receipt and continuing retention
of the trust property unconscionable.42

D. Type-2 Constructive Trustees: Liability to Account
as a Constructive Trustee
6-24

6-25

The defining feature of Type-2 constructive trusteeship is that liability is not based upon
the existence of a pre-existing fiduciary relationship to which the defendant constructive
is a party that precedes the acts said to give rise to liability. A Type-2 constructive trustee is
said to be accountable or liable 'as if a constructive trustee', which, of course he is not in any
meaningful sense. The expression 'constructive trustee' in the context of a Type-2 constructive trustee is nothing more than a formula for personal liability.43
There is no necessary or complete alignment between Type-1 constructive trusteeship and
a substantive, proprietary remedy. A Type-1 constructive trustee is both personally liable
(as part and parcel of this existing fiduciary duty) to restore to the plaintiff the property
subject to the constructive trust (such property being traceable on the principles discussed
in Chapter 13) or, if the property can no longer be traced, to restore the commensurate
value to the plaintiff. Similarly, neither is it correct to assume that a Type-2 constructive
trusteeship, which is in many cases effectively a personal liability to account, cannot give
rise to proprietary relief, for example where property is stolen. The defendant to an action
for knowing receipt of the proceeds of a breach of trust or for dishonestly procuring or
assisting in a breach of trust or other fiduciary duty, even without receipt of any of the trust
property are instances of Type-2 constructive trusteeship. In either case liability depends
upon the defendant continuing to hold or retain trust property. A knowing recipient is a
special case and demonstrates the point above concerning the lack of alignment between
a Type-2 constructive trustee and personal liability. A knowing recipient that continues to
hold the trust property they have received is subject to a proprietary remedy to recover that
property from the recipient. Where the requirements of the cause of action are proven,44 a
knowing recipient is also personally liable to account even if it has parted with or used up
the trust assets they have knowingly received.

Constructive Trusts

283

However, liability as a Type-2 constructive trustee is not confined only to cases of dishonest
assistance and knowing receipt. Nor is the liability of a Type-2 constructive trustee limited
only to personal liability. The law will impose a constructive trust and a proprietary remedy
which do not arise from a pre-existing fiduciary relationship-the most notable example
being those imposed upon property that is obtained by theft,45 fraud46 or mistake.47 While a
personal liability will exist anyway, the beneficiary is also able to assert a proprietary interest
in the subject matter of the claim.
Detailed consideration of the circumstances in which a person will be liable as a Type-2 constructive trustee for their dishonest assistance48 or knowing receipt49 is provided elsewhere.

i. Constructive Trusts Arising by Reason of Fraudulent Misrepresentation
Jersey's contract law is, in a number of respects, quite different from English contract law
and the Royal Court has cautioned against an assumption that it can or should declare the
law of Jersey by reference to English law principles which have been drawn from a fundamentally different approach to the law of contract.50 There are four basic elements necessary
to constitute a contract under Jersey law: (1) capacity; (2) consent; (3) cause; and (4) objet.
Jersey's law of contract determines consent by use of the subjective theory of contract.51
It follows that, for a contractual theory based on the subjective intention of the parties, a
mistake is the principle obstacle to a valid contract.52 In Jersey law, consent is prevented,
amongst other things, by erreur.53 Erreur, as recognised in Jersey law, is of two kinds: erreur
obstacle (erreurs that prevent the meeting of minds necessary to constitute a contract's creation and cause a contract to be a nullity absolue) and erreur vice du consentement (a defect
of consent where there is consent/meeting of minds but consent is impeachable for some
other reason and which causes a contract to be a nullity relative. There is recent Jersey
authority for the proposition that a vice du consentement (and, a fortiori, erreur obstacle)
will render a contract void ab initio, that is to say, it never existed. Erreur vice du consentement is said to be relevant in this case.54 It follows that unlike English law, a contract is void,

as though it never happened and not voidable if induced by fraud.55 And so the English
authorities56 to the effect that a transaction whereby property is transferred must first be
rescinded before any question of proprietary rights and claims can be addressed are not
applicable in Jersey.57 Any transfers of property subject to the void contract should never
have been and so are traceable into substituted assets.58

ii. Constructive Trusts Arising by Reason of the Theft of Property
6-29

It is now settled law in Jersey, although the point has been rehearsed in a number of later
judgments by reference to Lord Browne-Wilkinson's rudimentary analogy of a bag of coins,
that where property is obtained by fraud (at least where there is a fiduciary relationship
between fraudster and victim), equity imposes a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient allowing the plaintiff to trace his stolen property in accordance with the established
rules of tracing in equity.59 Strictly speaking it is impossible for the thief to become a constructive trustee, having neither the legal nor beneficial title to the property stolen vested
in them. Putting to one side a situation where the fiduciary has stolen the funds (which
makes the fiduciary a Type-1 constructive trustee) the approach of the Court is to treat
the thief (even a stranger) as a Type-1 constructive trustee, so as to afford the victim of the
theft a full suite of remedies against them including a proprietary claim and not merely a
personal right to seek an account. It is the act of theft and not any pre-existing fiduciary
relationship that allows for the possibility of a proprietary claim. It follows that a plaintiff
has a proprietary claim to profits obtained from the use of those stolen monies on the usual
tracing principles.60

iii. Constructive Trusts and Unjust Enrichment
6-30

Where property in respect of which a person has an equitable proprietary interest (the
beneficiary) is received by an innocent volunteer, the beneficiary has a personal claim in
restitution against the recipient even where the recipient has not been guilty of any 'fault'
in receiving the property. The state of mind required for a 'knowing receipt' claim under
English law is not required in Jersey. It is a strict restitutionary liability. The beneficiary can
only succeed in obtaining restitution for the third party to the extent that the recipient remains
unjustly enriched. A defence of change of position is therefore available.61 The Court has
repeatedly emphasised that the liability of the third party is a personal one; the recipient is

not a constructive trustee of the property for the beneficiary in any proprietary sense.62 It
follows that Jersey law does not, as yet, currently recognise the imposition of a constructive
trust in the absence of any existing cause of action to remedy unjust enrichment; a so-called
remedial constructive trust.63

III. Resulting Trusts
Jersey law will recognise a resulting trust to have arisen in the following circumstances:
first, where a there is a voluntary payment of money by one person to another to enable
the second person to purchase an asset, with the asset then being subject to a resulting trust
in favour of the paying party in proportion to their contribution (a presumed resulting
trust).64 In relation to this type of resulting trust, the trust arises on the presumed intention
of the transferor not to make a gratuitous transfer.65 The second circumstance in which a
resulting trust will arise is where there is a transfer of property on express trusts but the
trusts so declared fail or fail to fully exhaust the entire beneficial interest in the property
transferred (an automatic resulting trust).66 A trust arises by operation of law in order
to allocate a beneficial interest which would otherwise be left in limbo; equity abhors a
vacuum. In contrast to a presumed resulting trust, an automatic resulting trust does not
give effect to an intention on the part of the settlor to retain a beneficial interest but almost
always arises in circumstances in which the settlor does not intend or foresee any beneficial
interest remaining with him.67 A third circumstance in which a resulting trust is recognised
is where a person ('A') pays or transfers money or property to another ('B') so that B holds
the money or property in trust for A subject to a power for B to apply the money or property for a stated purpose.68 In any of these circumstances, the resulting trust is enforceable
only in so far as the conscience of the trustee is affected by having knowledge of the facts
giving rise to the relationship of trustee and beneficiary.69

to be owned beneficially by the person in whose name it is purchased or transferred but
instead that the property was intended to be beneficially owned by the person contributing
the money to buy it in the proportion contributed.70 However, this is only a presumption
which will yield if there is evidence of an actual contrary intention to effect gratuitous
transfer of beneficial ownership. The presumption of a resulting trust is also thought to
yield to a presumption that a gift is intended, and no beneficial interest results, where an
asset is placed or purchased in the name of a child by a father or someone who otherwise
stands in a position of loco parentis to the child:71 the presumption of advancement. There
are, as yet, no reported or unreported decisions concerning the presumption of advancement in Jersey. The presumption of advancement will itself yield where there is evidence of
an actual intention not to make a gift at the time when the property is purchased. Where the
purchase is made in the name of some third party in order to effect a fraudulent or unlawful
purpose, then a party to that purpose (if it has been carried out) cannot seek to rely on the
improper purpose to establish his beneficial title to the asset if the purpose has been carried
out. Where it is sought to rebut the presumption of advancement, a defendant may adduce
evidence of the plaintiff 's subsequent conduct but if the defendant seeks to raise a defence
that a gift was intended, the plaintiff may adduce evidence, including evidence of an proper
purpose in order to uphold the resulting trust in their favour.72 Where, however, the plaintiff needs to rebut the presumption of advancement in order to establish a beneficial interest, he is not entitled to lead evidence of the improper purpose to rebut the presumption if
that purchase has been carried out.73
An important distinction between Jersey law and English law concerning the principle by
which a person who contributes money or property to allow a third party to purchase assets
in their own or joint names is that the principle is incapable of applying to the purchase
of Jersey immovable property.74 Jersey's law of immovable property does not recognise the
possibility of a concurrent beneficial interest alongside the legal title.75

fail to exhaust the beneficial interest.76 Once the settlor's intention to transfer assets on trust
is established that fails to dispose of the settlor's whole beneficial interest in the property
transferred, the resulting trust arises.77 The resulting trust arises automatically and not on
the basis of an actual or presumed intention of the settlor.
Subject to the terms of a trust and subject to any order of the Court, where an interest
under a trust lapses, the trust terminates, where there is no beneficiary and no person who
can become a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the trust; or where property is
vested in a person which is not for his or her sole benefit and the trusts upon which he or
she is to hold the property are not declared or communicated to the person, the interest or
property affected by such lapse, termination, want of a beneficiary or lack of declaration
or communication of trusts shall be held for the settlor absolutely or for the settlor's estate,
passing by will under a residuary gift or if there is no gift of residue, on a partial intestacy.78
No resulting trust will arise in circumstances where there is no transfer of property on trust
(it is impossible for a person to be a trustee, holding property absolutely for themselves).
Where property is settled under a power of appointment or advancement from one trust to
another, then if any property in the second settlement falls subject to Article 42 the property advanced or appointed results back to the settlement from which it came.79 The settlor
for these purposes is the particular person who provided the interest or property affected
by the lapse or termination80 Since 27 October 2006, unless its terms provide otherwise, a
­Jersey trust may continue in existence for an unlimited period and no rule against perpetuities or excessive accumulations shall apply to a Jersey trust or to any advancement, appointment, payment or application of assets from a trust.81 It follows that a Jersey trust will not
fail for perpetuity, giving rise to a resulting trust. A trust may still fail for uncertainty of
objects giving rise to a resulting trust in favour of the settlor.82 A disposition into trust that
is reversed on the basis of a mistake either at customary law or the statutory jurisdiction
under Article 47B-47H Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 inclusive, is held on bare trust absolutely
for the settlor.83 A trustee of a trust that fails, giving rise to a resulting trust in favour of the
settlor, is entitled to take, or retain to the extent already paid, its costs of administration of
the trust during the period that it had acted as trustee.84
Where property is settled so as to create successive interests, in circumstances where an
income or other like interest comes to a premature end and if the interest subsequent to it
is not accelerated, there will be a resulting trust of the income arising between the point at
which the prior income interest fails and the time of its natural termination, in favour of
the settlor (in the absence of any long-stop gift or trust).

Resulting and Constructive Trusts

C. Quistclose Trusts
6-37

6-38

If person (A) transfers money to another person (B) subject to a power to apply the sum
for a particular purpose (typically for the payment of certain debts of B), not only will
the arrangement usually give rise to a personal contractual liability for B to repay A if that
purpose is not achieved, but such an arrangement may also give rise to a species of resulting trust known as a Quistclose trust,85 in favour of A. A's beneficial interest in the sum
advanced to B subsists until the power to apply the money for its particular purpose is
validly exercised. The only trust that exists is a resulting trust from the outset in favour of
A and the existence of a mere power (and not a trust) to apply the sum advanced for a purpose does not constitute a purpose trust,86 although such a private purpose trust is, unlike
in English law, capable of existing in Jersey law.87 It is not a requirement that the recipient
must apply the money in accordance with the stated purpose-the purpose may never arise.
What is required is that the money, if applied at all, is applied only for the stated purpose.88
In circumstances where the power is not subject to a duty on the recipient to exercise the
power, we consider that the power is not in the nature of a full fiduciary or special power.89
If the money is applied for that purpose it is freed of the subsisting beneficial interest in
favour of A. In default of the power being exercised, the resulting trust continues to subsist
by default. The usual principles applicable to ascertaining the certainty of the power still
apply. If the power fails for uncertainty the recipient simply has no power to make use of
the money and must return it to the transferor when called for. In terms of categorisation,
if such an exercise is helpful, a resulting trust arises because of a disposition for an express
purpose which, if it fails, fails to exhaust the whole beneficial interest of the transferor.90 It
follows that the transferor has locus to see that the funds advanced are used for the purpose
for which they are designated91 and to pursue a third party that dishonestly assists in or
receives the proceeds of a breach of that trust.92 The arising resulting trust affords the transferor priority status as a secured creditor of B in respect of the sums advanced.
A resulting trust will not usually arise simply because money is paid for a particular purpose. The key question in each case is whether the parties intended that the money or
property paid over was at the free disposal of the recipient.93 The normal rules of evidence

apply in ascertaining the intention of the parties.94 Where what is ascertained is an intention by the parties that the money, once transferred, would be subsumed by the recipient
into their general pool of assets and was at the recipient's free disposal then no resulting
trust will arise.

D. To whom the Property Results
Where there is no person to whom the trust property may devolve, the trust's Jersey situs
property results to the Crown in right of Jersey and vests in HM Receiver General. In principle, the Receiver General may also claim property on behalf of the Crown in Jersey as bona
vacantia (wherever situated) that belonged to a deceased person domiciled in Jersey or a
dissolved Jersey registered company.

94 See Ch 4 for the applicable principles in construing written instruments. In cases where no written instrument is involved, the intention of the parties is to be objectively ascertained from the circumstances of the transaction that show the mutual intention of payer and recipient (and the essence of their bargain); Barclays Bank Ltd

Personal Remedies against
Trustees: The Personal Accountability
of the Trustee and Liability for
Breaches of Trust

The beneficiaries of a Jersey trust are entitled to the proper execution of the trust by the
trustee in accordance with the general law and the terms of the trust, for the purposes for
which the property was settled.1 The statutory duties of the trustees are set out in Article 21
of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, the key provisions of which are:
21 Duties of trustee
(1) A trustee shall in the execution of his or her duties and in the exercise of his or her powers and
discretions -
(a)

act -
(i)
with due diligence,
(ii) as would a prudent person,
(iii) to the best of the trustee's ability and skill; and

(b) observe the utmost good faith.
(2) Subject to this Law, a trustee shall carry out and administer the trust in accordance with its
terms.
(3) Subject to the terms of the trust, a trustee shall -
(a) so far as is reasonable preserve the value of the trust property;
(b) so far as is reasonable enhance the value of the trust property.
(4) Except -
(a) with the approval of the court; or
(b) as permitted by this Law or expressly provided by the terms of the trust,
a trustee shall not -
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

directly or indirectly profit from the trustee's trusteeship;
cause or permit any other person to profit directly or indirectly from such trusteeship; or
on the trustee's own account enter into any transaction with the trustees or relating to
the trust property which may result in such profit.

Personal Remedies against Trustees

(5) A trustee shall keep accurate accounts and records of the trustee's trusteeship.
(6) A trustee shall keep trust property separate from his or her personal property and separately
identifiable from any other property of which he or she is a trustee

7-2

The trustee's failure, whether by positive act or omission, to administer the trust in accordance with its terms or comply with any duty imposed on a trustee by the 1984 Law will
amount to a breach of trust,2 which, if it causes a loss to the trust fund, or to the beneficiaries personally, is actionable by the beneficiaries for compensation in the nature of damages
from the trustee to personally make good the loss caused.3 The beneficiaries' claim for compensation or for an order that the trustee account is not the only possible remedy available
where a breach of trust has occurred. Alongside a personal remedy against the trustee for
reparation for the loss, it may be possible to assert a proprietary remedy by tracing the
trust property held by the trustee or into the hands of a third party.4 A third party to the
trust may also become personally liable for their dishonest assistance or knowing receipt
of trust assets misapplied in breach of trust.5 A claim for dishonest assistance or knowing
receipt is premised on a breach of trust or fiduciary duty and the personal liability of the
trustee for a breach of trust or fiduciary duty that causes loss to the fund which (assuming the trustee is able to recover the assets or otherwise satisfy that liability) is the primary
claim to be considered in this chapter. A breach of trust has the potential to undermine the
trust and confidence of the beneficiaries so that the trustee's continuation in office becomes
detrimental to the good administration of the trust and is recognised as a proper basis upon
which the court may remove a trustee if it fails to resign voluntarily.6

I. Actions for an Account
7-3

An action for breach of trust is brought by way of a claim that the trustee account to the
beneficiaries for the loss sustained in their administration of the trust.7 Claims alleging
a breach of trust should ordinarily be commenced by way of Order of Justice, requiring
full particulars as to the breaches of duty alleged.8 In very many cases, the amount of the
loss will be quantifiable (either by way of admission or proved at trial) without the need
for the taking of a separate account of the trustee's administration and the claim is simply
brought for a monetary remedy by way of equitable compensation in the nature of damages
or for the return of the missing trust property to make whole the loss.9 Where the loss is
not obviously quantifiable, the Court may order the trustee, as part of a court-supervised
process, to provide an account to the beneficiary of the trustee's administration of the trust.
It should be remembered that the account itself is not the remedy that will restore the loss

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 1(1).

3 A breach of trust may still be actionable even if no loss is caused. 'Loss' can include profits that would have

been made but for breach of trust by improper investment of trust funds; see Midland Bank Trust Co (Jersey) Ltd
v Federated Pension Services [1994 JLR 276].

5 As to claims for secondary liability, see Chs 9 and 12.

to the fund; it is the mechanism by which the amount of the loss and the trustee's personal
liability to make good that loss is ascertained.
A court-ordered account serves the purpose of allowing the beneficiaries to know what
assets the trustee has received, what the trustee has done with those assets over time by way
of re-sale, investment or distribution to the beneficiaries, what income or gains the assets
have yielded and the current status of the trust fund. The account may identify specific
assets of which the beneficiaries may have been unaware in respect of which the beneficiaries may be entitled to proprietary relief. The procedure also enables the beneficiaries to
ascertain what, if any, personal liability the trustee has arising from its maladministration.10
Where the trustee no longer has an asset which it should have (because the trustee cannot
account for whether the asset has been sold, invested or distributed) the account serves to
convert the obligation to restore the asset into a personal obligation to pay an equivalent
sum as an equitable debt or liability in the nature of debt.11 The same principle applies to
third parties who receive misdirected trust assets with sufficient knowledge of their wrongful provenance who are described as being liable as a constructive trustee and are personally
accountable in the same sense.12
The Royal Court has jurisdiction to order the giving of an account in common form and on
the basis of wilful default.13 The usual form of order for an account, referred to as an order
for an account in common form, requires the defendant to account only for what he or she
has actually received, the trustee's expenses and any disbursements. The taking of an account
in common form does not imply wrongdoing by the trustee against whom it is made, it is
simply part and parcel of the fundamental requirement of the office of trustee to account
to their beneficiaries.14 Once the account is prepared, it is open to the beneficiaries to seek
orders to surcharge or falsify particular transactions in the account. Where entries in the
account are falsified or surcharged, at the conclusion of the account being taken, the result
will be an excess of assets that are deemed to be what the trustee should still be holding, as
against what is actually in its hands. The trustee is personally liable to make up the shortfall,
usually restoring to the trust fund a monetary sum of commensurate value to the shortfall.

A. Proceedings for an Account in Common Form
There are no reported decisions, procedural rules or practice directions in Jersey as to how
an account in common form or an account on the basis of wilful default is to be conducted.
In the absence of local procedural rules, recourse may properly be had to the English procedural rules.15 A claim for an account of the trustee's administration of a trust is conventionally

divided into three stages. The first stage concerns the plaintiff beneficiaries' entitlement to
an account and on what basis. The second is the taking of the account which may be a separate set of proceedings from the trial and for which directions and further evidence may
be ordered (the taking of the account may, in simple cases, be delegated from the Inferior
Number to the Master)16 and which results in a verified settled account covering the period
for which the account is given. The third stage (where the account yields a discrepancy
between what the trustee actually has and what they should have) is for relief, usually in the
form of an order for payment.

B. The Beneficiary's Entitlement to an Account
7-7

The trustee's liability to account to the beneficiaries arises automatically from the trustee's
receipt of property as trustee.17 The liability to account in common form does not depend
on the defendant having mishandled the property or otherwise breached their trust.18 The
beneficiaries may allege and seek to prove specific irregularities in the account and if they
succeed then the order will direct that the accounts be taken in light of the Court's findings.
The Court's jurisdiction to order an account is within the discretion of the Court and the
Court may refuse to do so where an account in common form is unnecessary or unlikely
to be fruitful.19 However, given the fundamental nature of an account to the relationship
between a trustee and beneficiary, for the Court to refuse to order an account would require
special circumstances.

C. Settled Accounts
7-8

A trustee is not obliged to provide an account if they have already been released from their
duty to account by having already delivered an account that has been settled.20 The beneficiaries can only hope to circumvent this defence if able to prove the settlement was obtained
by fraud or imposition,21 or that it contains sufficient errors of sufficient magnitude to warrant setting it aside and taking the account afresh.22 If the beneficiary can only prove errors
of a lesser number or magnitude then they will normally be granted leave to surcharge or

16 However given the restrictions on what the Master may determine on his own (matters falling within the
RCR 2004, pt 8 (Interim Payments) are reserved to the Inferior Number), and that an account on the basis of wilful
default entails factual findings of fault against the trustee, an account on the basis of wilful default may have to be
determined before the Royal Court sitting in the Inferior Number.

falsify the account in respect of the errors. The onus falls upon the beneficiary to rectify
specific errors and the Court will not usually allow the beneficiary to assume a roving commission to seek out fresh breaches of trust.23

D. Taking the Account
The trustee is expected to submit their verified accounts and supporting documents, and
the beneficiary may then raise any specific objections they may have. Objections to an
account presented to the Court as complete by the trustee are either by way of surcharge or
falsification. To surcharge the accounts is to credit the account with a transaction (or credit
more than is admitted by the trustee's own account) on the incoming side of the account.
To falsify the account is to seek to treat as expunged an item of discharge or loss to the
fund that has been wrongly inserted into the outgoings side of the account by the trustee-
the beneficiary alleging that the entry in the account showing as a debit was improperly
recorded as properly paid out.
In an account in common form, the beneficiary has the burden of proving surcharges and
the trustee carries the burden of proving their discharge.24 The trustee must be prepared
to document each item, and presumptions may be made against them if they have not kept
proper records or have destroyed them. The Court should lean particularly hard against a
professional who has kept inadequate records as well as against a trustee who has destroyed
trust records in bad faith.

7-9

7-10

i. Accounting for the Income of the Trust
The account will consist of so-called 'items of charge' and 'items of discharge'. Items of
charge are items that are debited against the trustee on the incoming side of the account (ie
sums received). An accountable party must 'charge themselves' with any property actually
received in their capacity as trustee, whether personally or through an agent, as well as the
fruits of that property or property exchanged for the original property as the trustee invests
and reinvests the sums received. The criterion of whether property is received by the trustee
is the trustee's control of it.25 Where there are multiple trustees, the receipts of one trustee
are not to be vicariously imputed to another for this purpose.26
Where the basis upon which a sum has been paid out from the trust fund is not clear, a
claim that the beneficiaries are entitled to falsify the accounts may put the burden on the
trustee to explain the payment in or out of the trust without the beneficiary having to
specify the precise nature of the breach. However, where the trustee provides the beneficiaries with a detailed breakdown of its receipts, costs and fees and distributions from the fund,
the beneficiaries are expected to state their objections to particular items in the account.27

Personal Remedies against Trustees

ii. Accounting for the Outgoings from the Trust
7-13

On the other side of the account are items of discharge which operate to extinguish the
trustee's personal responsibility for their receipts or items of charge. A trustee is entitled to
a discharge in respect of all payments and transfers of trust property received as items of
charge that are necessary to carry out any of the duties and powers. There are recognised to
be three types of discharge: discharges for proper payments to the beneficiary; discharges
for proper administrative outlays;28 and, discharges for property lost or stolen through no
fault of the trustee. Where the trustee validly exercises a power of sale over a trust asset or
investment, this is treated in the account as the trustee being charged with the proceeds of
sale or investment in place of the original item of charge in respect of the property received
by the trustee and used to acquire the new investment. Where a trustee has entered into a
transaction that is not authorised by the trust instrument or by the general law, it is disallowed on the taking of the account by it being falsified. By falsifying the transaction, the
account is then taken as if the expenditure had not been made, and as if the unauthorised investment had not formed part of the assets of the trust. That creates a deficit in the
account that the trustee is personally liable to make whole. Where the trustee has misapplied the trust property the trustee's liability to restore it is strict, and does not depend on
proof of causation. Therefore, where for example an investment may be acquired by the
trustee with the consent of a protector and such consent is not forthcoming, if the trustee
acquires the investment which then falls in value, the trustee is personally liable to restore
the value the investment was acquired for and is not to be given credit for any extraneous
factor that might have caused a loss of value in any event had the investment been authorised (like a sudden collapse in share prices).

iii. Accounting for the Misapplication of Trust Assets
7-14

The trustee is not entitled to a discharge for dispositions of property not authorised by the
terms of the trust or made in breach of the general law. Unauthorised outlays by the trustee
are liable to be struck from the account and the account falsified so as to be taken on the
basis that the asset or money used to meet the outlay had remained in trust.29 When the
account is finalised, this will give rise to a discrepancy between what the trustee has and
what the trustee ought to have that the trustee will have to make up from its own funds.
Disallowed items of discharge can include the trustee's consumption, discard of or destruction of the trust property; giving it to a person not entitled to it under the trust; the misapplication or appropriation of the trust property for their own purposes or the making of
an unauthorised investment.30 The breach does not need to be pleaded, but can simply be
raised as an objection to the account, and the resulting personal liability is not a species of
damages.31 The trustee is required to make good the deficiency in the account from their
28 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 26(2) including the cost to the trustee of employing or delegating to any person
in the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 25.

own pocket. Alternatively, the beneficiary may elect to ratify the unauthorised transaction
if it has fortuitously resulted in valuable proceeds or a gain.32 Usually the misapplied assets
are accounted for at values on the date when the account is taken and not the earlier date
on which they were misapplied.33

iv. Consequential Relief upon the Taking of the Account
Usually beneficiaries will seek consequential relief which is the final stage of the account. In
each case where by reason of their misconduct the balance of the account is greater than the
funds actually held by the trustee, the trustee is required to make good the difference with
a monetary payment from their own pocket.

E. Accounts on the Footing of Wilful Default
In contrast to an account in common form, an account ordered on the basis of wilful
default is grounded on the trustee's misconduct.34 If the complaint is that the trustee has
omitted to do something which a prudent trustee ought to have done, an account on the
footing of wilful default, this is an account of which he might have received but for the
trustee's wilful default.35 In order to obtain an order for taking of an account on the basis
of wilful default the plaintiff beneficiary must show there has been a loss of assets received
by the trustee or assets which might have been received.36 The availability of an account
on the basis of wilful default is not confined to cases of conscious wrongdoing by the trustee.37 An account on the basis of wilful default casts a far more substantial burden of proof
on the trustee than applies in an account in common form. The onus is on the trustee to
justify the account where the beneficiary seeks to falsify or surcharge an entry. An account
on the footing of a wilful default leads to an order requiring the trustee to replenish funds
wrongfully depleted by him or her and in that sense to make restitution for the benefit of
the plaintiff beneficiary.
To obtain an account on the footing of wilful default, the beneficiaries must make out a
special case by pleading and proving that the past conduct of the trustees raises a prima
facie inference that other breaches, not yet known to the beneficiary or the Court, have
occurred.38 The Court may order an account on the basis of wilful default upon proof of at
least one instance of wilful default;39 however, it would have to be a very telling instance.40
The Court may also take into account evidence of bad faith as well as the trustees'

conduct in the litigation.41 Poor or inadequate record keeping is not thought to be a sufficient basis to seek an account.42 If the admissions and proofs before the Court are conflicting or raise only a weak suspicion then an inquiry may be directed in order to gather
further evidence. Where individual instances of wilful default are proven but the evidence
is not strong enough to support an order for a general account, the Court may give relief in
respect of the proven breaches only.43

i. Orders for an Account on the Basis of Wilful Default
7-18

7-19

The term wilful default is synonymous with breach of trust: A failure to meet the applicable
standard of care will constitute wilful default as much as intentional wrongdoing whether
the trustee knows it to constitute a breach of duty or not.44 The emphasis in an account
on the basis of wilful default is whether the trustee has failed to discharge its duty rather
than whether the plaintiff beneficiary has established any active misconduct in breach of
its duties (although proof of this will be sufficient to justify an order). However there is no
alignment between what might be termed 'active' and 'passive' breaches of trust and the
basis of the account that may be ordered.45 The true distinction is between an order for
administration (the account in common form), which arises from the Court's jurisdiction
to supervise the trustee's administration of the fund and fails to do so properly (if this can
be called a passive breach by not doing what the trustee ought to have done), and an order
for an account to replenish the fund where the complaint is about specific instances of
wrongdoing by the trustee (which might be referred to as active breaches, although 'active'
may mean non-feasance as well as misfeasance).46
An account on the basis of wilful default covers the same ground as an account in common
form but additionally the trustee is surcharged with items of charge that the trustee would
have received but for the trustee's wilful default. The Court is granted a roving commission
to inquire into all aspects of the trustee's administration of the trust.47 The purpose of an
account on the basis of wilful default is to discover concealed misconduct by the trustee
and to put mismanaged trusts in order. Misconduct may be investigated in the course of an
account on the basis of wilful default that was neither pleaded nor mentioned at the hearing at which the account was directed. A direction that an account be taken on the basis of
wilful default is not a common order to make. It has been described as 'drastic' and 'a very
strong' order to make.48 There are no reported (or unreported) decisions in Jersey where
an account on this basis has been ordered and in practice (owing to the limited judicial

resources that would need to be dedicated to what has the potential to be extremely timeconsuming) the Court is likely to be reluctant to make such an order unless persuaded of
the clear need for it.49 The Court may refuse to make an order if it considers that an account
on this basis would be oppressive or wasteful50 or an account in common form would be
more proportionate and appropriate use of resources.
Where a trustee is found to have caused the fund to suffer a loss through their wilful default,
the beneficiaries will usually seek to surcharge the account in the amount of the loss giving
rise to a discrepancy between what the trustee actually holds and what it is recorded as holding that the trustee is liable to make good from their own resources. The loss is accounted
for on the incoming/item of charge side of the account as if the trustee had received more.
However, this does not mean that the surcharge represents a receipt that never materialised.
It is not only breaches of the trustee's duty that may result in the trustee not receiving an
asset that they would have received if they had done their duty that are accounted for in this
way. For example, a trustee may be charged on the basis of wilful default where they invest
the fund negligently, or where they fail to safeguard the fund by monitoring others.51 The
governing concept is compensation for loss caused by breach of duty.52

7-20

F. Rescission of Transactions and an Account of Profits
Where a transaction has been entered into by the trustee, in breach of his fiduciary duties
to the beneficiaries, the beneficiaries may be able to seek a rescission of the transaction and
an account of profits in the hands of the trustee, such as to put the trust fund in the same
financial position it was in before the breach of duty occurred.53 Where a trustee has made
a profit from the trust fund the profit is imbued with a constructive trust in favour of the
beneficiaries and so usually no question of personal liability arises, the beneficiaries (subject to the doctrine of notice) have an unassailable proprietary entitlement to the profit in
the hands of the trustee or a third party, if it still exists. However, the beneficiaries are not
entitled to recover both the profits and the loss suffered by the fund; they must elect which
to pursue.54

II. The Basic Rule for the Personal Liability of the Trustee
A trustee is liable for a breach of trust either committed by the trustee or in which the
trustee has actively or by omission concurred.55 The basic rule on the personal liability of a
trustee for breach of trust is that he must restore to the trust fund (rather than the beneficiary

bringing the action personally) either the value of the assets which have been lost by reason
of the breach of trust, or the monetary value of the profit, if any, which would have accrued
to the trust property if there had been no such breach.56 A plaintiff in a breach of trust
action must prove both the fact and the amount of loss suffered.57 The trustee's personal
liability continues in existence after trust has been terminated. A trustee cannot therefore
seek to mitigate the quantum of their liability by bringing the trust to an end. Where the
trusts are no longer subsisting at the date of trial, the award of compensation is made to
the beneficiary or beneficiaries absolutely entitled or possibly by way of a reconstitution
of the trust fund.58 At such point, there is no longer a right to specific restitution of the
trust estate. If specific restitution of the trust property is not possible, the trustee must pay
sufficient compensation to put the estate back to what it would have been had the breach
not been committed.59 A trustee is not be liable for a breach of trust committed prior to
the trustee's appointment, but a trustee who becomes aware of a breach of trust committed prior to their appointment is obliged to take all reasonable steps to have such breach
investigated and remedied.60

A. What Loss Is Recoverable?
7-23

A breach is only actionable where a loss has been caused by the breach. 'Loss' for this purpose includes opportunity or profits that would have been made but for breach of trust
by improper investment of trust funds.61 A breach of trust does not necessarily give rise
to an actionable loss. There are circumstances where a trustee may commit a judicious
breach of their duties or act beyond their powers62 but cause no loss, for example by making an investment in a class of asset which is prohibited by the trust instrument but which
nonetheless increases in value. Whilst a beneficiary may require such trustee to sell the
unauthorised investment and reinvest the process in an authorised manner, no loss will
have been suffered.

B. Causation and Loss
7-24

Is a trustee that commits a breach of trust liable to compensate the beneficiaries only for
losses caused by the breach, or also for losses which would have been suffered in any event
even if there had been no breach? Put another way, what are the rules of causation of loss in

The Personal Liability of Trustees

a claim for breach of trust? The House of Lords (affirmed in Jersey and since reaffirmed by
the UK Supreme Court) has held that the test is one of 'but for' causation.63 Where the loss
would have been caused in any event, there is no right to compensation. The position may
be different in the case of a subsisting trust, where the loss would be that of the fund, and
all of the beneficiaries would need to be compensated for the breach. It should therefore be
borne in mind that the recoverable loss will often depend on the nature of the trust and on
whether it is subsisting at the date of trial.
The test as to whether compensation may be recovered is the same where there is a dishonest breach, and the Court is then not precluded by authority or by principle from asking whether the loss would have occurred in any event simply because there is an element
of dishonesty in the defendant's conduct.64 Where, however, rescission of a transaction is
available, say because of a non-disclosure by a fiduciary, it is irrelevant what would have
happened if the relevant disclosure had been made.
The trustee is liable for all loss which would not have been suffered but for the breach.
Therefore the principles as to causation, foreseeability and remoteness of loss are not to
be applied in the assessment of the compensation payable.65 The trustee is liable for the
whole loss, however unexpected the result. The trustee's performance must, however, not
be judged with hindsight. The exception to the principle of strict liability for loss is where a
trustee is in breach of the equitable or statutory66 duty of skill and care. Compensation may
be sought for loss arising from a negligent breach of trust but the compensation sought is
more akin to damages and so the principles of causation and remoteness are reintroduced
to determine the measure of damages that apply. This is because the award of equitable
compensation in such a case is equivalent to the award of damages (for breach of contract
or in tort) at common law.67 Where a breach of the duty of care is alleged, the plaintiff must
show that the loss would have been avoided if the breach had not occurred (ie that alleged
breaches of duty were the cause of the loss for which compensation is claimed) and that
the scope and purpose of the equitable duty of care concerned is to prevent the type of loss
that has been sustained.

7-25

7-26

C. Valuation of the Loss
The quantum of compensation is that required to restore the trust to its value as if the
breach had not taken place.68 Where the beach consists of an omission to act, compensation is to be calculated on the basis of what a prudent trustee would have achieved had the
omission not occurred. As a general rule, there is no element of penalty in the assessment
of compensation.69 The loss is assessed at trial with the full benefit of hindsight and not

the date of loss.70 However, a trustee who improperly parts with trust assets is not bound
to restore the highest value that they attained between the breach of trust and the trial, but
only their value at trial.71 That is not the approach adopted to valuation of the loss where
the action is for an account of profits wrongfully obtained by the trustee in breach of fiduciary duty. The amount recoverable in an action claiming an account of profits is dependent
upon the profit made by the fiduciary, not (as in a breach of trust claim) where it is dependent upon the loss suffered by the beneficiaries.

D. Setting off Losses Against Gains
7-28

A breach of trust need not necessarily result in a loss to the trust fund. For example, a trustee may invest in a particular asset class prohibited by the trust instrument that fortuitously
yields a gain. A trustee liable for a loss caused by a breach of trust cannot raise as a defence
to their obligation to reconstitute the fund, a profit or gain arising in respect of another part
of the trust fund.72 There is English authority to the effect that this prohibition on set-off
depends upon whether the breaches are unconnected (where no set-off is permitted) or
connected (where set-off may be possible).73 However, there are no Jersey authorities that
have affirmed this principle. The prohibition on set-off applies irrespective of the proximity
the breaches have to one another.

In any proceedings for the recovery of any debt or damages, the Royal Court may, if it thinks
fit, order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given, simple interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the debt or damages in respect of
which judgment is given, or, if payment is made before judgment, for the whole or any part
of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date of judgment
(or the date of payment if earlier).74 A claim for breach of trust is a claim for damages for

this purpose.75 The Royal Court will generally awards interest, subject to this discretion, on
any compensation that a trustee is ordered to pay for a breach of trust. The 1996 Law does
not permit the Royal Court to award interest upon interest; it follows that only simple interest may be awarded under the 1996 Law.76 Even where the breach is an improper payment
made bona fides under a mistake of law, the trustee is regarded as still having the money in
his own hands and is accordingly liable to pay interest as well as capital.
The Royal Court has said that its preference is to adopt an interest rate based on bank base
rates, with an uplift of 1 per cent to reflect obtainable market rates on bank deposits.77 It
has been the longstanding practice of the Jersey courts to award interest at a slightly higher
rate than the English courts.78 In circumstances where, as has been the case since 2009, the
Bank of England's base rate has stood at 0.5 per cent for a prolonged period, the Court is
likely to award interest at base rate, or at such rate as can be shown to have been reasonably
available to depositors during the period of the loss plus 1 per cent. It is not the purpose of
an award of interest to penalise a defendant.79 Jersey follows the English practice of applying US Prime Rate when making awards in US dollars in commercial cases.80
It is open to the plaintiff beneficiaries to plead and prove actual interest losses caused by
late payment of a debt which might include an element of compound interest, and that
such losses would be subject to the principles governing all claims for damages for breach
of contract.81 Such a situation may arise where, for example, an investment wrongfully sold
out was yielding more than the pre-judgment court rate of 2 per cent, in which case the
trustees may be held chargeable with the rate of interest that it was yielding.
Pre-judgment interest, that is interest on a sum for which judgment is given in a breach
of trust action, is not to be confused with the judgment debt rate of interest, at which the
judgment sum (inclusive of pre-judgment interest) will accrue if not paid, which is currently capped at 2 per cent above the prevailing UK selected retail banks short-term money
rates (base rate), interest per annum.82 It appears to have been the practice for some time
in ­Jersey (albeit prior to the collapse in interest rates seen since the 2008/09 financial crisis)
that pre-judgment and post-judgments rates of interests were in alignment.83

jurisdiction to award compound interest in cases of fraud or breach of fiduciary duty.84
Compound interest will often be ordered as a substitute for ordering a disgorgement of
profits but the Royal Court has stated that is reluctant to lay down any rigid rules as to the
circumstances in which it will make an award of compound interest. The Royal Court has
recently affirmed the principle that in assessing a proper measure of compensation, which
an award of interest is intended to do, the Court should apply restitutionary principles so
as to put the plaintiff back into the position he would have enjoyed but for the breach of
trust.85 Interest normally runs from the date of the breach86 but in certain circumstances,
fairness might dictate that interest should not start to run until a defendant was aware that
a claim was to be made against him. However, the plaintiff 's delay in commencing proceedings from the accrual of the cause of action will not always impact on the date from which
interest was ordered to run.87 Compound interest may be ordered with the number of rests
per year at the Court's discretion.88

III. The Personal Liability of Protectors
7-35

As a matter of principle, as equitable compensation is available as a remedy for breach
of fiduciary duty generally, there seems to the author no reason why a protector who has
breached a fiduciary duty by failing to properly exercise a fiduciary or special power cannot
be personally liable for the loss to the fund arising from such a breach. However, the functions of a protector and the nature of their powers varies sufficiently from trust to trust to
such an extent that it is not possible to lay down a general proposition to the effect that a
protector owes an equitable duty of care to the beneficiaries. It would have to be demonstrated with sufficient clarity on the facts of a particular case that the protector has assumed
a duty of care for the beneficiaries' interests for the protector to be liable for breach of a
duty of care and skill.

IV. Procedure and Parties

Procedure and Parties

305

since the trustee is entitled to know by way of a fully pleaded case89 precisely what is alleged
against it.90 In a claim for breach of trust, at least one of the current trustees must be a party
to ensure there is someone able to receive any compensation that is ordered.91 Where an
order is sought that compensation be paid to the trust fund (ie a claim for reconstitution),
the author's view is that the claim is only properly constituted if all the trustees in office at
the time of the breach are joined as parties either as defendants, or as plaintiffs (in the case
where a co-trustee or former trustee sues another incumbent or former trustee for breaches
of trust).92 The liability of co-trustees for a breach of trust is joint and several and therefore
all the trustees at the time of the breach are likely to be necessary and proper parties for the
purposes of joinder.93 No party may be joined as a plaintiff against their will.94 Where relief
is not sought to reconstitute the trust fund but to compensate the beneficiaries personally
(because the breach predates the termination of the trust) there is old English authority to
the effect that a claim may be brought against the defaulting trustee alone without joining
former co-trustees.95 In the author's view, plaintiff beneficiaries intending to reserve their
right to sue another trustee whom is not joined as a party to proceedings for breach of trust
from the outset should expressly state the basis upon which they have not joined the trustee,
otherwise the subsequent proceedings against a trustee not originally joined are likely to be
vulnerable to an application to strike out.96

A. Joinder of Beneficiaries
The plaintiff in a claim for breach of trust is usually a beneficiary or a new trustee. A beneficiary of a discretionary trust has sufficient locus standi to sue their trustee for breach of
trust and seek reconstitution of the trust fund if they are an object of a fiduciary, special or
mere power or have a contingent interest under an ultimate default trust.97 Any plaintiff
to a breach of trust claim, whether a trustee or beneficiary, must give an address for service
in Jersey.98 As a general rule, those parties named in proceedings are bound by any judgment or order delivered in those proceedings and are not able to re-open any issue which is

subject to a chose jugée. A compromise of the claim for breach of trust will be binding on
those who are privy to it for the same reason.
Where the plaintiff to the action is the trustee, the trustee may prosecute the claim without
joining any of beneficiaries.99 Any judgment or order given or made in those proceedings
shall be binding on the beneficiaries unless the Court in the same or other proceedings
otherwise orders. The Court may only do so on the ground that the trustees could not or
did not in fact represent the interests of those persons in the first mentioned proceedings.100
There is usually no need for the trustee to join beneficiaries as additional defendants unless
the relief that is sought prejudices or affects them distinctly from the other beneficiaries.101
Where the plaintiff to the action is brought by the beneficiaries, it is not necessary for all
beneficiaries to be named as plaintiffs (if it is even possible to do so)102 as all beneficiaries
will, at least in most circumstances, have a privity of interest in the proceedings as there will
be a sufficient degree of identity between them such that all will be bound. The Court may
if it considers it expedient to do so, appoint one or more named parties to the proceedings to represent any person or class of persons who is or may be interested or otherwise
affected by the proceedings. Where the Court makes such an order, any judgment or order
of the Court given or made when the person or persons appointed in exercise of that power
are before the Court shall be binding on the person or class represented by the person or
persons so appointed.103 Where one or more beneficiaries have a demonstrably separate
interest from that of other beneficiaries, such as where one class of beneficiaries will not
benefit from any compensation recovered or may have their interests defeated, they will
not be bound by any judgment given in proceedings to which they are not parties and may
appear separately. The Royal Court may also order that any judgment or order made in
proceedings in which the trustee appears as a party purportedly representing the interests
of the beneficiaries does not bind those beneficiaries where the trustee could not or did
not in fact represent the interests of those persons in the first mentioned proceedings, acts
fraudulently, or colludes with the other party to the proceedings.104
Where beneficiaries who are not parties wish actively to participate in the dispute, for
example because they do not agree with the way in which the claim is being prosecuted,
they should apply by way of summons to be joined at the earliest possible opportunity, but
in being joined will be bound once a judgment is delivered.105 This is particularly so where
the defendant trustee proposes to settle on terms which one or more beneficiaries consider
to be disadvantageous.
Royal Court rule 4/4(4) provides that where the Court has made an order under that rule
and any compromise of the proceedings is proposed and some of the persons who are
interested in, or who may be affected by, the compromise are not parties to the proceedings
(including unborn or unascertained persons) the Court, if satisfied that the compromise

will be for the benefit of the absent persons and that it is expedient to exercise this power,
may approve the compromise and order that it shall be binding on the absent persons, and
they shall be bound accordingly except where the order has been obtained by fraud or nondisclosure of material facts. The Court may only approve a settlement of the proceedings
if there is some other person with the same interest as a party convened before the Court
who agrees to the compromise or on whose behalf the Court sanctions the compromise;
or the absent persons are represented by a person appointed under rule 4/4(1) RCR 2004
who so agrees.
The beneficiaries who are not joined to the proceedings may apply by way of summons
to take over the conduct of the claim from the trustee, as we consider that if they fail to
do so and a compromise is reached, it will be too late for them to start a new claim, unless
their interest is not bound by the judgment. If they are bound, and are dissatisfied with the
compromise made by the trustee, the beneficiaries have a remedy against the trustee for his
conduct of the claim, not against the trustee against whom the claim was brought.

B. Locus Standi for a Breach of Trust Action
Only beneficiaries,106 that is those to whom the trustee is liable to account,107 and any other
trustee of the trust, have standing to take proceedings in respect of a breach of trust. This
excludes those with whom the trustee does not stand in a fiduciary relationship from bringing a claim but who might otherwise be interested in in the outcome such as a protector, the settlor or an excluded beneficiary (for breaches occurring after their exclusion).
A beneficiary for this purpose includes a beneficiary with a vested interest in the trust
or a contingent beneficiary, however remote the contingency.108 An object of a fiduciary
power-whether a trust power (ie a power that the trustee was required to exercise) or a
mere power (ie a power that the trustee had merely to consider from time to time whether
or not to exercise)109-had locus standi to bring proceedings for breach of trust and seek
relief, including the reconstitution of the trust fund if loss had been caused to it by a trustee's breach of trust. It would be a matter of discretion for the court, in a particular case, as
to what relief, if any, should be granted.110 The Royal Court in Ansbacher also expressed the
view that where a party with standing to bring a claim for breach of trust failed to do so and
allowed his claim to become statute barred, and later procured a beneficiary to bring the
claim as his 'stool pigeon', relief may be refused as a matter of discretion.111

Personal Remedies against Trustees

Where there is a trustee capable of bringing a claim for breach of trust against a co-trustee
or a former trustee, it is inappropriate for the beneficiaries to commence the action for
breach of trust and the claim will be improperly constituted unless circumstances exist that
make it appropriate for the beneficiaries to bring a derivative claim. No beneficiary has any
entitlement as of right to bring a derivative action at the expense of the trust fund.112 In a
derivative action, the beneficiary would be acting as a trustee and the trustee would in effect
be a third party-if it were to lose, damages would be payable by it to the trust fund rather
than to the beneficiary.113 In appropriate cases, an action by a beneficiary might lie against
an agent of a trustee if the agent were aware that the beneficiary might rely on his negligent
advice and therefore suffered economic loss, or if the agent assumed responsibility to the
beneficiaries.114
It follows that a beneficiary cannot invite the Court to intervene to vindicate his interest in
the trust if the beneficiary has no interest and so no locus to bring a breach of trust claim in
respect of trust capital or income in which he has no or no potential interest. A beneficiary
with an interest in part of the trust fund cannot complain of a breach of trust in respect of
another part of the trust property held on trusts for other beneficiaries and which cannot
accrue to the part of the trust property in which he is interested. A beneficial interest that is
validly assigned will permit the assignee to stand in the position of the original beneficiary
and have the same locus as the original beneficiary to seek a remedy for a breach of trust.
Where the beneficial interest is resettled on new or sub-trusts, it is the trustee of that second
settlement that will have locus to sue the trustees of the head-settlement. The beneficiaries
of the second settlement may be able to bring a derivative claim against the trustees of the
head-settlement for breach of trust if there are special circumstances.115

C. Claims by Trustees
7-46

The other trustees (if there is more than one) have locus to take proceedings against a
defaulting trustees.116 The trustees can (indeed are obliged) to get in the lost assets or monetary compensation of commensurate value even though they were themselves implicated
in the breach of trust. The object is to secure the return of the trust property for the benefit
of all the beneficiaries according to their respective interests. The fact that the defaulting
trustee may have a defence as against an individual beneficiary is irrelevant.117

112 In The Matter of the X Trust [2012 (2) JLR 260]. The Court may authorise the bringing of a derivative action
and the rights of the beneficiaries to be indemnified for their costs in the same way as a trustee would, were the
trustee bringing the claim under Art 51(3) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. Leave to bring a derivative claim should
be commenced by way of separate proceedings commenced by Representation; see Ch 3 and Ch 12.

Liability between Co-trustees

309

V. Personal Liability for Breaches of Trust as
between Co-trustees
A trustee of a Jersey trust is not liable for a breach of trust committed by a co-trustee unless
the trustee becomes aware or ought to have become aware of the commission of such breach
or of the intention or threat of his or her co-trustee to commit a breach of trust; and the
trustee actively conceals such breach or such intention or fails within a reasonable time to
take active measures to protect the fund and the beneficiaries' interests or restore the trust
property or prevent such breach.118 The trustee's failure to do any of these things will make
the trustee concurrent in the co-trustee's breach. The practical importance of the principle
that a trustee is not generally liable for the acts or defaults of a co-trustee is limited by the
principle that where there is more than one trustee, trusteeship is a joint and continuous
office and that trustees must act jointly in the execution of the trust.119 Where two or more
trustees are liable in respect of a breach of trust, they shall be liable jointly and severally.120
If the breach of trust has already been committed and comes to light a co-trustee should
bring an action for the restoration of the trust fund or, at least, take such other active measures as in all the circumstances may be most prudent. A trustee who discovers a breach of
trust by his co-trustee is usually well advised to seek directions from the Court as to what,
if any, steps he should take to remedy it.
Where co-trustees are jointly liable for a breach of trust, the beneficiaries (or trustee) may
seek to satisfy a judgment against any one of the trustees. The trustee(s) against whom judgment is sought to be satisfied may be able to claim a contribution from the other trustees who
are also liable. A contribution may be ordered in appropriate cases under the inherent power of
the Court. Jersey's statutory regime governing the right of a party to seek a contribution is confined only to underlying claims between parties that are jointly and severally liable in tort.121 In
England, the equivalent statutory provision was section 6 of the Law Reform (­Married Women
and Tortfeasors) Act 1935. The report of the Law Commission (Law Comm No 79) in 1977
recommended that the statutory right to obtain a contribution should be widened to cover the
situation where one or other of the parties (or both) was not a tortfeasor but was liable to the
plaintiff for breach of contract, breach of trust or other breach of duty. That was achieved by
the passing of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. But in Jersey the position remains
unaltered. It follows that the defendant trustee may only seek a contribution from his cotrustee either under the jurisdiction that may exist at customary law to order a contribution
as between those equally liable (whether jointly or jointly and severally) to the plaintiff for a
common debt that existed at English common law prior to the passage of the 1978 Act, or if
the co-trustee could be liable in tort to the plaintiff, if sued, in respect of the damage which is
the subject of the claim in the Order of Justice.122 Conceivably a claim for contribution might
be brought in respect of a breach of the trustee's duties of care and skill which is analogous to
a tortious duty of care but that proposition is, as yet, unsupported by authority.

Personal Remedies against Trustees

A. Assessing the Contribution
7-49

The contribution to be paid by a trustee is such as may be found by the Court to be just
and equitable having regard to the extent of that trustee's responsibility for the damage for
which the compensation is payable. Where the trustees are equally blameworthy, the Court
will no doubt generally order contributions such that they suffer the compensation in equal
shares. In other cases, the Court can exempt a trustee from liability to make any contribution, or direct the payment of a complete indemnity. The extent of a trustee's liability for a
breach of trust can be measured according to the trustee's blameworthiness for the breach
as well as his proximity to it.123 It is thought that court will be slow to order a contribution
by a trustee who was in active breach of trust to another who was in passive breach on the
basis that it would discourage trustees from playing the active part they are expected to in
administering their trusts.124 Where all the trustees are equally guilty, there is usually no
reason the Court would not direct an equal apportionment.

VI. Trustee's Responsibility for Asset Managers,
Agents and Companies
7-50

Subject to the terms of the trust, a trustee may delegate the execution or exercise of any of
his or her trusts or administrative or dispositive powers (which may be sub-delegated).125
Unless the terms of the trust specifically provide to the contrary, a Jersey trustee may delegate management of any trust property to and employ investment managers whom the
trustee reasonably considers competent and qualified to manage the investment of trust
property and may employ accountants, advocates, attorneys, bankers, brokers, custodians,
investment advisors, nominees, property agents, solicitors and other professional agents
or persons to act in relation to any of the affairs of the trust or to hold any of the trust
property.126 A trustee shall not be liable for any loss to the trust arising from a delegation or
appointment under Article 25 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 who, in good faith and without neglect, makes such delegation or appointment or permits the continuation thereof.127
The effect of Article 25(3) is to throw the burden of proof upon the persons seeking to
charge the trustee with a loss caused by an agent whom he had properly employed although
the trustee bears the burden of establishing he acted in good faith and without neglect.
The provision applies both to the appointment of the agent and, as well, to the supervision
of the person to whom the trustee has delegated the functions in Article 25(2). An agent

124 Whether or not it orders a contribution, the Court may absolve a trustee who acts honestly and reasonably

and ought to be excused from liability under Art 45; see Ch 11. Note the comments in Bahin v Hughes (1886) 21
Ch D 390 at 398, per Fry LJ: 'it would act as an opiate upon the consciences of the trustees; so that instead of the
cestui que trust having the benefit of several acting trustees, each trustee would be looking to the other or others
for a right of indemnity, and so neglect the performance of his duties'.

Defences of Concurrence and Release

311

appointed by the trustee under Article 25, or a company within the same group as the
corporate trustee, acting within the scope of the authority conferred by trustee is not liable
as a trustee de son tort128 and an agent will (unless it assumes a duty of care towards the
beneficiaries directly) have no direct liability to the beneficiaries of the trust.129 If a trustee
were to refuse to enforce a claim against a defaulting agent, eg because of a close association with the agent, the beneficiaries of a trust could either bring an administrative action
seeking a direction from the Court that the trustee take the necessary action (or, perhaps,
that the trustee should be replaced) or, in special circumstances, they might be permitted to
bring a derivative action on behalf of the trust.130

VII. Defences of Concurrence and Release by a Beneficiary
A beneficiary of full age and capacity with full knowledge of all material facts may freely
consent to a breach of trust or may waive his right to sue his trustee.131 Having consented to
the breach or waived his rights, the beneficiary is not later permitted to sue for the breach.
The beneficiary's participation in the breach or where the beneficiary gives his consent to the
breach, will afford the trustee a defence. The beneficiary may also formally release his claim
against the trustee. The facts relied on in order to establish any of the defences considered
above must be specifically pleaded.132
A beneficiary who concurs in the acts that constitute a breach of trust by the trustee is
estopped from proceeding against the trustee for the consequences that arise from the
breach. This is so whether or not the beneficiary knew that the act constituted a breach
of trust133 and whether or not the beneficiary derived benefit from the breach.134 Where
a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation or at the request or with the consent
of a beneficiary, the Court may by order impound all or part of the interest of the beneficiary by way of indemnity to the trustee or any person claiming through the trustee.135
The Court will consider all the circumstances in order to determine whether it is fair and
equitable to allow the beneficiary to sue the trustee for a breach in which the beneficiary
has concurred. In particular, the Court will focus on whether the beneficiary understood
what he was concurring in.136 No estoppel will arise where the beneficiary is a minor unless
possibly where the beneficiary falsely claims to be of age in order to induce the trustee to
breach its duties.137

Personal Remedies against Trustees

A. The Requirements for a Valid Release
7-53

For a release or confirmation to be valid the following conditions must be satisfied:138
1.
2.
3.

7-54

The beneficiary must be of full age and capacity.
The beneficiary must have full knowledge of all material facts.
The release must not improperly induced by the trustee to give the release.

The test regarding the degree of knowledge required of a beneficiary has been stated as
follows:139
The … court has to consider all the circumstances in which the concurrence of the [beneficiary]
of the trust was given with a view to seeing whether it is fair and equitable that, having given his
concurrence, he should afterwards turn round and sue the trustees; … subject to this, it is not
necessary that he should know that what he is concurring in is a breach of trust, provided that he
fully understands what he is concurring in, and … it is not necessary that he should himself have
directly benefited by the breach of trust.

B. Effect of Concurrence and Release
7-55

7-56

A beneficiary who concurs in a breach of trust or who relieves a trustee from liability,
is forever barred from suing the trustee. A beneficiary's interest under the trust may be
impounded by the trustee to indemnify the trustee who committed the breach140 in making
whole the loss claimed by the beneficiaries. The release or concurrence of one beneficiary
does not prevent another beneficiary, who has not so waived the right to sue, from bringing
a claim for breach of trust. A new trustee, having a privity of interest with the beneficiaries
in respect of a breach of trust is in no better position than them and if all have acquiesced
in a breach of trust, then the trustee will have no claim.
Does a beneficiary who has lost the right to sue the trustee by reason of concurrence or
release have a right to benefit in the future from the fruits of any claim brought back into
the trust resulting from a claim brought by another beneficiary. The obvious practical problem is that the compensation paid by the trustee to reconstitute the fund is likely to be
mixed with assets already held by the trustee, such that it may not be possible to ascertain
with any degree of certainty whether an appointment out is of assets recovered following
a successful claim for a breach of trust to which the beneficiary had concurred. It may be
open to the Court to make a declaration that the trustee may not appoint out in favour of
one or more objects who concurred in a breach, thus requiring the trustee to maintain a
segregated fund comprised only of the compensation. The author does not consider there
to be any principled basis to suggest there should be a reduction in the amount of compensation payable on the grounds that a beneficiary had concurred in the breach as there can be
no certainty that the acquiescing beneficiary would ever have received the sum paid by way
of compensation, and it is hard to see how it could be just to deprive the other beneficiaries
of the of the full amount recovered from a claim against the trustee.

Exculpatory Provisions

313

VIII. Defence under Exculpatory Provisions
in the Trust Instrument
The statutory and customary law defences available to a trustee charged with a breach
of trust may be extended by the express terms of the trust.141 An effective defence may
be achieved by provisions in the trust instrument which, either alone or in combination,
enlarge the powers of trustee, abridge the duties of the trustee, exclude the trustee's liability
for breach of trust or enlarge rights of indemnity in respect of liabilities to third parties
incurred by a trustee in the administration of a trust.

7-57

A. Enlarging the Powers of the Trustees
The express terms of a trust may enlarge the powers of trustees so as to authorise some act
in the administration of the trust which would not otherwise be authorised. A very common example was an extended investment power. However, Jersey law has long provided
that a trustee, in relation to the trust property, has all the powers of a natural person acting
as the beneficial owner of such property.142 A trustee acting in accordance with an extended
power or in accordance with a power reserved to a third party under Article 9A will not be
liable for breach of trust in respect of his action because there is no breach of trust.143 As
is discussed elsewhere, whether the actions taken in accordance with the terms of the trust
are authorised or not has no impact on whether the trustee is entitled to its indemnity out
of the trust property in respect of liabilities, costs and expenses properly incurred by it in
connection with its action.144 Whether a trustee acts within the four corners of the power
conferred is a separate question to whether it acts in accordance with its duties of diligence,
as would a prudent person, to the best of the trustee's ability and skill while observing the
trustee's duty of utmost good faith.145 If some act or transaction, though within the scope
of the power, is in the particular circumstances of the case one that a prudent trustee would
not have exercised, the trustee cannot seek to rely upon the extended power as authorising
the act or transaction.146

7-58

B. Abridged Duties of Trustees
The provisions of the trust instrument may also abridge the ordinary duties of the trustees.147 A common example of the abridgement of the duties of trustees is a provision

Personal Remedies against Trustees

limiting the duty to interfere in the management of a company in which the trust is a substantial shareholder so that a trustee has no duty to interfere if he has no notice of any act of
dishonesty or misappropriation by the directors, known as an anti-Bartlett clause.148 While
the trustee's duties in Article 21(3) and (4) are stated to be subject to the terms of the trust,
the duties in Article 21(1) are not similarly qualified suggesting that these core duties are
not capable of being excluded either expressly or impliedly by the terms of the trust. Trust
provisions which enlarge trustees' powers or abridge their duties have the effect of making
what would otherwise make the trustee liable for breach of trust, lawful so that where such
a provision is engaged, there is no unauthorised act or breach of duty.

C. Anti-Barlett Clauses
7-60

7-61

7-62

7-63

The vast majority of professional Jersey trustees are unlikely to have either the inclination
or necessary commercial experience to either manage or exercise a controlling shareholding
in a trading company in which the trust has an interest. The vast majority of professionally drafted trust deeds (dating from the early 1980s) include clauses that have the effect
of negativing the trustee's duty to enquire into or interfere in the conduct of a company in
which the trustee has an interest, at any rate unless they are aware of circumstances calling
for enquiry, Such clauses are known colloquially as 'anti-Bartlett'149 clauses.
The wording of anti-Bartlett clauses varies. A clause that simply gives the trustee a power to
leave the conduct of the company's affairs to its directors, is, on a conventional analysis, a
trust power like any other, to be exercised for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Such a clause
will not afford the trustee any protection if it never gives any thought to whether it should
exercise any control, since such a power, if it is to be effective, must be consciously exercised.
Usually, an anti-Bartlett the clause will exclude the trustee's duty to enquire and supervise
in the affairs of any company in which the trust has an interest. Such a provision is not
properly to be regarded as an exemption clause as it presupposes no breach of trust: but a
restriction on the trustee's duties. A clause worded so as to relieve the trustee of any duty
of enquiry unless he has knowledge of circumstances which call for an enquiry, excludes
the preliminary duty on the trustee of keeping abreast of the company's affairs. But if the
trustee does become aware of circumstances which call for enquiry, the clause will afford
the trustee no protection thereafter if it does not intervene.
Even if an anti-Bartlett clause relieves the trustee of any duty to interfere, it will afford the
trustee no protection if the trustee decides to intervene. Where a trustee's own employees
or directors are appointed as directors of a company held by the trust, the trustee will have
chosen to have conduct of the company's affairs and may be held liable accordingly and an
anti-Bartlett clause will afford no protection to the trustee.
Where provision is made in the trust instrument for the settlor or a third party to give
binding directions as to the exercise of the trustee's rights as shareholder it is not unusual
to also find clauses in the trust instrument that go further than negating the trustee's duty

but impose a positive duty on the trustees not to interfere in the management of the company, at any rate in the absence of knowledge of dishonesty on the part of the directors. The
retention of such a power is not of itself objectionable150 but opens the issue as to whether
the power to give directions is fiduciary in nature, in which case the trustee may continue
to owe a duty to bring the matter before the Court.151 Whether or not the trustee's duties
are curtailed by way of an anti-Bartlett clause, the directors of such a company will still owe
duties to and be liable on those duties to the company as directors, to which an anti-Bartlett
clause is no answer. A beneficiary may prevail upon the trustee to exercise its control as
shareholder to procure the company to sue its directors where they have acted in breach of
their duties. Where the trustee has, through its own directors or employees, had conduct of
the company's affairs so as to give rise to a conflict of interest, that may afford the beneficiaries grounds to seek relief by way of a derivative claim.152
As well as the risk of civil liability, a trustee that shuts its eyes to criminal conduct of a company (or its directors) in which the trust has an interest exposes itself to the risk of committing a criminal offence of being involved in a prohibited arrangement if the trustee shut its
eyes to what is going on.153

i. An Irreducible Core of Obligations
There are limits beyond which the abridgement of trustees' duties cannot go. To do so
would be wholly to negate the trustees' duties such that there would be no trust at all. The
English Court of Appeal has referred to the 'irreducible core of obligations' of the trustee
upon which no encroachment is permitted.154 It seems from the drafting of Article 21(1)
that the terms of a trust may not negate the trustee's fiduciary duty to act in utmost good
faith, and the trustee's duty to act with due diligence, as would a prudent person, to the best
of the trustee's ability and skill.

D. Excluding the Trustee's Liability for Breach of Trust-Trustee
Exemption Clauses
A different kind of protection from that afforded by a provision abridging the trustee's
duties or extending its powers, is often afforded to trustees of Jersey trusts by an express
provision in the trust instrument that excludes or limits the trustee's personal liability for
breaches of trust. An exemption clause does not have the same effect of a clause enlarging the powers or abridging the duties of the trustee which is to make the act authorised.
An exemption clause has the effect of saving the trustee from the personal liability to pay

150

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 9A.
It is to be noted that Art 9A(3) provides that 'where a power mentioned […] has been reserved or granted
by the settlor, a trustee who acts in accordance with the exercise of the power is not acting in breach of trust'. Notwithstanding such provision, in the authors' view it is wrong in principle to assume that the trustee is under no
liability if it is complicit in or otherwise gives effect to an exercise or direction that is harmful to the beneficiaries'
interests without question.

Personal Remedies against Trustees

compensation for breach of trust, and so may, to that extent, have a practical effect similar
to that of a provision extending powers or abridging duties. An exemption clause does not
usually have the effect of negating the beneficiaries' cause of action altogether. Nor does
such a clause have the effect of conferring a good title on a person to whom the trustee has
made an unauthorised distribution so as to protect such a person from a tracing claim,
or perhaps even a personal remedy for knowing receipt.155 Nor does an exemption clause
allow a trustee to retain unauthorised profits for which he would otherwise be accountable at any rate in the absence of special wording in the trust instrument.156 A trustee may
consciously rely on the latter provisions to justify their acts or omissions. But a trustee may
not consciously rely upon an exemption clause to justify a departure from the trusts, for
a trustee who relies on such a clause to justify what he proposes to do will thereby lose its
protection.157 Many professionally drafted trust instruments exclude liability for the trustee's ordinary negligence so that in order to make a trustee liable some element of bad faith,
reckless indifference or gross negligence to the terms of the trust must be established.158 An
exemption clause is usually to be construed as availing former trustees as well as incumbent trustees. Commensurate with an outgoing trustee's continuing right of indemnity for
costs reasonable incurred, an exemption clause forms part of the terms on which a trustee
accepts office and provides protection in respect of his conduct as a trustee.

i. The Scope of Exemption Clauses
7-67

The rule of general application is that an exemption clause in a trust instrument can
exclude liability for everything except the trustee's own fraud, wilful misconduct or gross
negligence.159 It should be noted that the position in Jersey is stricter than the prevailing
position in English law where it is possible to exclude liability for everything up to the
trustee's fraud, including gross negligence.160 Absent specific wording to the contrary, an
exemption clause which excludes the liability of the trustee will not also exclude the liability
of agents under the contractual or common law duties they may owe to the trustee. Gross
negligence means a serious or flagrant degree of negligence which amounts to an unusual
and marked departure from the normal standards of professional trustees and does not
import any requirement to prove deliberate or reckless fault which is associated with wilful misconduct; the two concepts are not synonymous.161 It is clear that the term 'wilful
default' in the context of exemption clauses does not have the same technical meaning in
which that term is used as the basis upon which an account may be ordered.162 A common
formulation for limiting the scope of an exemption clause is to exclude liability for 'wilful

155 While it is a prerequisite for liability on the ground of knowing receipt that there should have been a transfer
of property in breach of trust, there is no requirement that the trustees must be personally liable to pay compensation for the breach of trust. By the same principle a third party may be liable for dishonest assistance in a case
where the trustee, because of an exemption clause, cannot be pursued for compensation.

default'. The potential for confusion arises because, as discussed above, the court may order
a trustee to account on the basis of 'wilful default', and 'wilful default' in the context of an
account, includes default on the basis of the trustee's ordinary negligence.163 In the context
of exemption clauses, however, 'wilful default' has a similar meaning to wilful misconduct
in this context and is to be equated with consciousness that the act or omission complained
of is a breach of duty, or recklessness as to whether that act or omission is a breach of
duty.164 The limiting words 'wilful breach of this trust' refer to deliberately and purposely
doing something which the trustee knows, when he does it, amounts to a breach of trust,
consisting in his failure to perform his duty as trustee. 'Wilful … wrongdoing' is a reference
to a deliberate breach of trust.165 Thus, where 'wilful default' and 'wilful misconduct' occur
it is not clear whether recklessness would suffice to take the trustee outside the protection of
the exemption clause. The meaning of the limiting words 'gross negligence' in the context of
an exemption clause is problematic, it having been said that English lawyers have a healthy
disrespect for the distinction between negligence and gross negligence, and that it is merely
one of degree which is a serious, unusual and marked departure from the normal standards
of professional trustees.
It has been held that a trustee whose exemption from liability does not extend to a 'breach
of trust knowingly and wilfully committed' is liable if he knowingly and wilfully (ie intentionally) does something which is a breach of trust, even though he does not know it to be
a breach of trust.166 This is in contrast to the position in English law in relation to limiting
words such as 'wilful default', 'wilful misconduct' and 'wilful breach of trust' where it is suggested that it is not enough that the trustee intentionally does something which is a breach
of trust, but that, in addition, the trustee must know that his acts are unauthorised and so
a breach of trust, or be reckless in that regard. If a trustee embarks upon a course of action
knowing it is unauthorised, then, in the context of 'wilful default', 'wilful misconduct' and
'wilful breach of trust' the trustee will have disqualified himself from coming within the
scope of the exemption clause. Trustees who knowingly set out to achieve a result which
they knew were not authorised by the terms of the trust may be acting dishonestly. A trustee
will not be protected, even if his liability is limited to actual fraud, if he makes a distribution
to someone whom he knows is not a beneficiary, and through ignorance of the law does not
know what fraud or dishonesty means.167
Fraud in this context connotes, at minimum, an intention on the part of the trustee to
pursue a particular course of action, either knowing that it is contrary to the interests of the
beneficiaries, or being recklessly indifferent as to whether it is contrary to their interests or
not.168 Fraud in this context is inclusive of but not co-extensive with the concept of fraud

Personal Remedies against Trustees

in Jersey's customary law.169 To count as fraud, there is no requirement that the trustee
should benefit personally from the wrongful distribution. In the context of an exemption
clause fraud means dishonesty.170 It is for the Court to determine what are the normally
acceptable standards of honest conduct and the fact that the trustee concerned genuinely believes that he has not fallen below those standards is irrelevant.171 Not all deliberate breaches of trust will be fraudulent. A trustee may deliberately exceeds his powers in
good faith and in the belief, which does not fall below the normally acceptable standards
of honest conduct, that he is acting in the interests of the beneficiaries is not committing a
fraud.172 However, if no reasonable trustee could have thought that what it was doing was
for the benefit of the beneficiaries will not be honest even though the trustee's belief in its
own honesty was actually held.173
In a case where the breach of trust relates not to investment or administration of the trust
fund but to distribution, a distinction needs to be drawn between two kinds of case. It will
be a fraudulent breach of trust if the trustee makes a distribution of trust assets to a person
whom he knows is not entitled or is recklessly indifferent whether that person is entitled
or not. However, where the trustee makes a distribution to a person whom he believes in
good faith to be entitled, though greater care might have revealed that his belief was not well
founded, is not fraud, though if a trustee were to receive legal advice to the effect that the
doubts as to beneficial entitlement are so serious that the proper course is to seek directions
from the Court, and ignores that advice, the trustee risks committing a fraudulent breach
of trust, on the ground that he has acted with reckless indifference.

ii. Interpretation of Exemption Clauses
7-71

7-72

An exemption clause is to be restrictively construed and anything that is not clearly written
in should be treating as falling outside it.174 It is for the trustee to show that the case against
them fell within the ambit of an exculpation clause with any doubt being resolved against
it; any ambiguity in the meaning of the words used would also be resolved against it.175
The approach of the Jersey courts to the construction of clauses by which exculpation from
liability is sought to be achieved is therefore similar to that of the English courts.176 There
is no Jersey equivalent to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 under which an exemption
clause may be declared inapplicable if it fails to meet the statutory test of reasonableness.
The most narrow limiting words permissible are for 'fraud', 'wilful misconduct' or 'gross
negligence', and these words should be construed in the ways considered above concerning the permitted scope of exemption clauses. We doubt whether the limiting word 'actual

319

fraud' adds anything significant.177 The limiting words which cause the greatest difficulty
are those which purport to include 'wilful default' within the scope of the exemption. ­'Wilful
default' was the formulation used in Article 30 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 prior to
1989 before it was replaced with 'wilful misconduct'.178 The potential for confusion arises
because in the context of a trustee being made accountable on the footing of 'wilful default',
he is made liable to account for money which he could with reasonable diligence have
received, and so the term 'wilful default' includes ordinary negligence, which Article 30
would suggest is within the permissible scope of an exemption clause.179 'Default' means
failing to do something which duty or law requires and which is something which the trustee ought, in all reasonableness, to do, having regard to the relationship that exists. What is
reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the case. If a trustee knows what he ought
to be doing, knows what is reasonable in the circumstances and, in that knowledge, fails to
do it then he is in default.180 'Wilful' only means that the action taken is done intentionally
as a spontaneous act of will and one which the person was not under compulsion to take.
It does not, in the view of the Royal Court, imply dishonesty and probably means no more
than that a reasonable man viewing the decision taken would not have taken the decision
under those circumstances. It follows that wilful default goes no further than a test of 'want
of ordinary prudence' or negligence test181
In the context of exemption clauses, 'wilful default' or 'wilful misconduct' is to be equated
with consciousness on the part of the trustee that the act or omission complained of is wrong
on his part or a breach of duty, or recklessness as to whether that act or omission is a breach of
duty.182 Though the limiting words 'wilful default' do not extend to negligence, they appear
to be wider than 'fraud' and 'gross negligence' in that a trustee who deliberately does something which he knows to be a breach of trust is not protected, even if he honestly believes that
the breach of trust is in the interests of the beneficiaries. It is the author's view is that the formulation in the current legislation, 'wilful misconduct,' is consistent with the interpretation
of the meaning of wilful default in the context of exemption clauses considered by the Jersey
Court of Appeal in Midland Bank Trustees (Jersey) Ltd v Federated Pension Services.

177 See Armitage v Nurse (n 44) at 250C; West v Lazard Bros & Co (Jersey) Ltd (n 33). Fraud in this context is
thought not to be equated with equitable fraud which generally covers matters which are outside the scope of
exemption clauses anyway; see Midland Bank Trustees (Jersey) Ltd v Federated Pension Services Ltd (n 3) at 297;

Personal Remedies against Trustees

The meaning of 'gross negligence' in the context of an exemption clause, as distinct from
ordinary negligence is merely one of degree.183 The Jersey Court of Appeal has said that
gross negligence involves a serious or flagrant degree of negligence, which is a serious, unusual and marked departure from the normal standards of professional trustees.184

E. Enlarged Rights of Indemnity in Respect of Liabilities to Third Parties
7-75

7-76

At customary law, which is mirrored in the terms of Article 26 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984, a trustee is not entitled to indemnity out of the trust property in respect of liabilities
to third parties and costs and expenses incurred in consequence of unauthorised acts.185
This default position is subject to any contrary provision in the trust instrument which
expressly enlarges a trustee's rights of indemnity in respect of liabilities to third parties, not
only by enlarging the powers of the trustee, but also by entitling a trustee to be indemnified in respect of unauthorised acts generally, or specified unauthorised acts, entered into
in good faith.
In the author's view, unless the court adopts a less strict approach to the construction of
exemption clauses than is usually adopted the common form of exemption clause will not
assist a trustee who in good faith enters into an unauthorised contract and faces a personal
claim from avoiding liability to the other contracting party. Liability at the instance of beneficiaries for breach of trust in respect of a loss to the trust fund (which is the traditional
providence of an exemption clause) is one thing. Entitlement against the beneficiaries to
indemnity out of the trust property in respect of personal liabilities of trustees to third
parties is quite another. The question will not be whether the beneficiaries can sue him for
breach of trust, but whether he can pay or recover the amount of the liability from the trust
fund. The effect of the trustee's limited liability to third parties, which has the potential to
operate in a similar fashion to an exemption clause in respect of liability to third parties, is
discussed elsewhere.186

IX. Power of Court to Relieve a Trustee from
Personal Liability
7-77

The Royal Court has a statutory jurisdiction under Article 45 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984,187 which provides:
45 Power to relieve trustee from personal liability
(1) The court may relieve a trustee either wholly or partly from personal liability for a breach of
trust where it appears to the court that -

(Jersey) Ltd [2009] JRC 003.
184 ibid.
185 As to the scope of the trustee's indemnity, see Ch 11.
186 See Ch 11.
187 The English equivalent provision is the Trustee Act 1925, s 61.

Court's Power to Grant Relief

321

(a) the trustee is or may be personally liable for the breach of trust;
(a) the trustee has acted honestly and reasonably;
(b) the trustee ought fairly to be excused -
(i)
for the breach of trust, or
(ii) for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which such breach
arose.

(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred
before or after the commencement of this Law.
Article 45 is not confined only to express trustees but includes trustees de son tort.188 The
formulation in Article 45(1)(a) means that relief may be granted for actual or potential past
liability incurred by the trustee but the Court cannot forgive a future liability. If there has
been no breach of trust, Article 45 cannot be invoked by the trustee. Article 45 is a provision
that is internal to the relationship between the trustee and beneficiaries and does not operate to excuse a trustee from liability to a third party to the trust contract.189 Article 45 is not
limited only to trusts that have beneficiaries capable of enforcing the duties of the trustee
and so also applies to charitable and private purpose trusts.

7-78

A. The Power is Discretionary
Article 45 confers a discretion upon the Court and it is not possible to lay down strict rules
as to the way in which the Court will exercise it, the merits of each case being governed by
its own circumstances. Indeed there are few reported cases in which the scope of Article 45
has been explored in any depth. The English case law arising from the mirror discretion
conferred by section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 is likely to be instructive as a guide. Being
an exercise in discretion, the Court of Appeal is likely to be reluctant to interfere with the
exercise of its discretion by the Royal Court.190

7-79

i. Honestly and Reasonably
The burden of proving that the trustee acted reasonably, as well as honestly, lies with the
trustee seeking relief.191 Whether a trustee seeking to rely on Article 45 has acted reasonably
and honestly is a question of fact in each case.192 There is high English authority that the
equivalent jurisdiction in English law was intended to protect honest trustees and ought
not to be narrowly construed.193 It is unlikely that the Jersey court would seek to apply an
artificially high restrictive or high threshold to the question of the trustee's reasonableness,
given Jersey's importance as an international financial centre for trust company business.
The threshold for relief is conjunctive. A trustee must have acted honestly and reasonably.

Honest folly is not to be excused.194 When considering whether a trustee has acted honestly,
the particular transaction is not to be viewed in isolation from others and the knowledge of
the trustee's officers is cumulative.195
a. Conduct Held Unreasonable
7-81

Every case turns on its own facts considered as a whole; without being exhaustive in the
slightest, the following are examples of conduct which has been held not to have been reasonable. A trustee that fails to obtain appropriate advice where this is called for does not act
reasonably.196 However, the trustee's reliance on legal advice is not, without more, a basis to
seek relief.197 Where the trustee has committed a breach of trust because it reasonably and
honestly relied on legal advice, the trustee is expected to attempt to recover the loss caused
from the legal advisor for their negligence. For the trustee not to do so and expect absolution from the Court is unreasonable.198

best or reasonable practice which increases the risk of loss from fraud is still a relevant
consideration for the Court when considering reasonableness even where the fraudster
would have achieved his goal even if the trustee had acted reasonably. Where one trustee
is wholly relieved from liability but the other is not, that other trustee will bear the whole
loss and is not usually entitled to a contribution or indemnity.206 There is English authority
pertaining to the liability of officers and auditors of companies, which may, by analogy, be
applicable to trustees, to the effect that it is not a bar to relief that the breach involves a want
of reasonable care and skill. A trustee who has committed a negligent breach of trust may
still, in all the circumstances, have acted reasonably.207
b. Conduct Held Reasonable
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of conduct where the trustee was held to
have been reasonable:
1.

Where trustees make a distribution or otherwise act on the footing of an understanding of the law subsequently held on appeal to be erroneous.208
Reasonably thinking that it had been properly appointed as trustee and having failed to
have acted as trustee after its purported resignation.209
Where trustees, acting on erroneous legal advice, make an unauthorised distribution.210
Erroneously assuming that the trustee had a power of sale but the sale would have been
a proper one if they had in fact possessed a power of sale.211
Where payment had been made to the wrong person on a reasonable misinterpretation
of the trust instrument.212
Where a trustee ceases to act as trustee having purported to transfer trusteeship to new
trustees on the basis of an appointment that appeared on its face to be formally valid
but which was found not to be.213
Where a trustee ceases to act as trustee having purported to transfer trusteeship pursuant to the exercise of a power that is set aside on the basis the basis of the statutory
jurisdiction under Article 47H of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.214
Wilfully compromising, abandoning or otherwise settling any debt or claim owed to
the trust where the trustee had reasonable grounds to believe pursuing proceedings
would have been ineffectual.215

Personal Remedies against Trustees

A careful and conscientious and thorough trustee who conducts a transaction by the book
in all respects but fails to discover a fraud is likely to be relieved by the Court.216 The question is whether the trustee acted reasonably, not whether best practice was adhered to in all
respects.217

ii. The Court's Discretion as to whether the Trustee Ought Fairly to be Excused
7-85

7-86

7-87

Even where the trustee's conduct has been honest and reasonable, the Court still has to consider whether the trustee should fairly be excused, both for the breach of trust and for the
trustee's failure to obtain the direction of the Court in the matter in which he committed
the breach of trust218-that is to say in fairness both to the trustee and to others who may
suffer detriment (such as the beneficiaries) if the relief is granted.219
In many of the English cases, one of the recurring factors to which the Court has regard is
whether the trustee seeking relief is lay or a professional, remunerated trustee. These cases
arise from a context in which, at least traditionally, trusteeship was a gratuitous office. A lay,
unremunerated trustee may be excused where they take decisions within the limits of their
experience and knowledge, listen to reason, and do not act irrationally or obdurately.220
The norm (although not universal) is that trustees of Jersey trusts are regulated professional
trustees. While the duties of a lay and a professional trustee are the same under Article 21, a
professional trustee's duty of reasonable skill and care is to be judged as reasonable having
regard to any knowledge or experience that it is objectively reasonable to expect a professional trustee to have.221 Further, where a trustee deliberately places itself in a position
where its duties as trustee do or are likely to conflict with its interest in a personal capacity
(for example by maintaining a business relationship with the settlor, a particular risk for
institutional trustees that are banks), the Court will be very reluctant to relieve the trustee
from liability.222
Many of the cases concern the liability of the trustee for losses caused to the trust arising
from a breach of trust. There is nothing in Article 45 to prevent the application of the article where the trustee has breached his duty by making a profit for himself or a third party
from his office as trustee. It is difficult to visualise circumstances in which a court would
conclude that a trustee who has made a profit from their office would have acted honestly
and reasonably in not returning that profit to the fund. Clearly where a proprietary claim
to such profit is still in prospect there is no reason to see why the Court would be moved to
protect the trustee.

Court's Power to Grant Relief

325

iii. Practice
Relief under Article 45 may be granted in breach of trust proceedings against the trustee
commenced by way of Order of Justice but may also been granted in proceedings commenced by Representation under the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. A trustee that fails
to plead its reliance on Article 45 (and the factual basis for such reliance) in its Answer is
likely to be in difficulties in obtaining relief under it.223 Relief under Article 45 may also be
claimed in proceedings that would be commenced by Representation by a trustee de son
tort seeking to regularise a defective appointment.224

material facts on which the party pleading relies for that party's claim or defence'.

Conflicts of Interest and
Unauthorised Profits
I. Introduction
The beneficiaries of a Jersey trust are entitled to the undivided loyalty of their trustee.1
A duty of fidelity or utmost good faith2 is the defining characteristic of a fiduciary, of which
a trustee is the archetypical (although not the only) example.3 A resulting trustee and a
category one constructive trustee4 may also owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries but
normally only where the trustee becomes aware of the circumstances giving rise to the
trust for whose benefit the property is subject.5 A trustee's duty of loyalty (or other fiduciary in an analogous position, such as a company director, agent6 or public servant)7 gives
rise to certain specific obligations.8 The first is that a trustee is not, without authorisation,9
permitted to retain a benefit or profit from the trust property or by virtue of trusteeship.10
The common effect of this rule, which does not depend on there being any fraud or absence
of good faith on the trustee's part,11 is that a trustee is not allowed to derive any personal
advantage or confer any advantage on a third party to the trust from its office. This is the
no-profit rule. But the trustee's obligations go further than that: the trustee is not allowed
to place itself in a position where its personal interest is allowed to conflict with its duties as
a fiduciary, or allow the performance of its obligations in one capacity to be influenced by

his obligations in another capacity.12 This is the no-conflict rule. The principle which is in
play in this rule is that the fiduciary must not be inhibited by the existence of his personal
interests or other employment from serving the sole interests of his beneficiaries as faithfully and effectively as if the beneficiaries were the only ones to whom the trustee is responsible.13 As can be seen from Article 21(4) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, the trustee's fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive in nature, informing the trustee what it
must not do, rather than what it should. Conduct which is in breach of these rules need not
be dishonest but it must be intentional for the consequences of the breach to bite.14 Thus a
trustee who acts loyally but incompetently is not in breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
beneficiaries, although may be in breach of its parallel duty to exercise diligence, prudence
and skill and care.15 The objective in the operation of these two rules, which may in practice
and conceptually overlap,16 is to preclude the trustee from succumbing to the temptation to
abuse its position to its own advantage and to preserve the trustee's obligations of fidelity.17
The vast majority of Jersey trustees are corporate entities rather than individuals. The assets
the trustee will be holding will often be shares in corporate vehicles, whether trading or not,
forming part of an underlying structure. This proliferation of corporations requires a careful analysis as to whether the conflict that is alleged to have arisen (and its consequences)
concerns the duties owed by the legal or natural persons who run the corporate trustee or
the duties owed by the directors of corporate entities within a trust structure (who will have
no fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries) or by the trustee itself to the beneficiaries. In each
case, what is required is a meticulous examination of the factual matrix to identify both the
fiduciary and non-fiduciary duties that are actually engaged, where in the trust structure
they arise and to whom such duties are owed.
The subject of conflicts of interest and conflicts of duties in regulated trust company businesses has been the subject of intense interest in recent years (from a regulatory standpoint)
from the Jersey Financial Services Commission.18 The Commission's concern arises from
the potential for conflicts of interest to strike at the heart of the fiduciary nature of trusteeship but also because conflicts have a tendency to undermine the confidence of those who
use Jersey trust structures in the quality of the services provided, thereby diminishing the
attractiveness of Jersey as an international financial centre.19 The Commission has sought
to test whether regulated trust company businesses' internal policies and procedures are

12 This rule finds partial expression in Art 21(4) (so far as the trustee's own interests are concerned) and a
prohibition on a trustee in conflict with its duties in another capacity is recognised in In The Matter of the E, L, O
and R Trusts (n 1).

sufficiently robust to identify and be able to deal with a range of conflicts as they arise, citing the following examples:
1.

2.
3.
4.
5.

6.
7.

The acceptance of a gift (above a de minimis value) from a client structure or relationship, or from a client, by an employee (or a relative of the employee) of the trust
company.
Retrocession fee arrangements (including shared fee/commission arrangements)
entered into by the trust company.20
Acting as a director or trustee of two or more structures in circumstances where a dispute arises between clients with interests in those structures.21
An employee of the trust company (or, relative of the employee) securing a personal
loan, or financing of any description, from a client structure, or, directly from a client.
A trust company, or an employee of the trust company (or, relative of the employee)
arranging to make a loan, or to arrange financing of any description, to a client structure, client entity or to a client directly.
Employees of the trust company (or, relative of the employee) co-investing with a client
structure, or, with a client.
Employees of the trust company providing a service to a client structure or to a client in
a private capacity that is not associated with or connected to the trust company.

As will be apparent from these specific examples, what the Commission and general law is
concerned to guard against is not only that that an actual or potential conflict should not
arise between the personal interests of the trustee (or individuals within it) and the interests of the beneficiaries or corporations to whom fiduciary duties are owed but also that an
actual or potential conflict of duties in different capacities (a conflict of duties) does not
also arise. A robust approach to on-site inspections and regulatory guidance notwithstanding, the Commission's role is as a macro-prudential financial services regulator and it will
not embroil itself in the management and legal consequences of specific instances of conflict that arise day-to-day in regulated trust company businesses, the resolution of which is
a matter for the general law.22
It is striking that while the prohibition on a conflict of interest or a conflict of duties features in a number of reported decisions of the Royal Court, in the main, those decisions
concern the exercise of discretions or powers alleged to be vitiated by a conflict or the
continuation in office of a conflicted trustee. There are relatively few reported decisions
in which the Court has explored in detail the principles governing a trustee's conflict of
interest on particular transactions in which the trustee is engaged. There is also a surprising dearth of Jersey authority on the treatment of unauthorised profits by trustees or those
associated with them. Given the examples cited by the Commission in its guidance, it is
not thought that the dearth of reported decisions is attributable to conflicts of interest not
being a source of difficulty for professional trustees.
Such Jersey authorities as there are on the issue of conflicts of interest take the principles
espoused in English and those of other Commonwealth jurisdictions as their starting point.
20 We would also include within this type of arrangement: interest rate spreads, payments in the nature of secret
commissions, gratuities, incentive payments, benefit kick-backs and bribes however described.

That trusteeship in Jersey is and always has been a professionalised and regulated
(since 1998) activity which forms a significant portion of the island's hugely profitable
financial services industry23 and, as a corollary, trusteeship in Jersey is expected to be a
remunerated and not a gratuitous office.24
That one of the consequences of the consolidation in the market for professional trustee services in recent years has been the emergence of large, institutional trustees that
often serve as trustee for numerous (sometimes related) trust and corporate structures
as well as providing a range of other financial products and services to trustees.25
That the employees or directors of a corporate trustee will often sit as directors on the
boards of companies whose shares are held by the trust, giving rise to a potential for a
conflict of duties between their obligations to the company of which they are directors,
and their duties as employees or directors of the corporate trustee.26

While unlike the related principle that the trustee should not, without authorisation, profit
from its office, which is stated expressly to be contrary to the trustee's duties in the terms
of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984,27 the no-conflict rule is not but exists as part of the general
law governing fiduciaries. The no-profit rule is part of a wider principle that a person in a
fiduciary position, of which a trustee is the archetypal example, is not permitted to put itself
in a position where his interest and his duty do or possibly may conflict.28 The test as to
whether the trustee's duty and interest does or may conflict is an objective test adopting the
perspective of a reasonable man, who, looking at the relevant circumstances would think
that there was a real sensible possibility of conflict.29
The no-conflict rules that applies to trustees of Jersey trusts is based on the very realistic
approach that, human nature being what it is, there is danger, in such circumstances, of

and commercial matters. See Code of Practice for Trust Company Business, principle 2.2: 'A registered person

'professional capacity'.
25 The issue of conflicts of interest in trust administration is not confined to large institutions; striking infringements of the no-conflict principle have involved smaller, older, owner-managed trust companies without a sophisticated compliance function and often with smaller client basis often connected through business, familial or
fraternal ties. See Dick v Pantrust International SA & Ors [2016] JRC 021.

the trustee being swayed by its personal interest rather than by its duty to the beneficiaries.30 That reality is a particular feature of trusteeship in a jurisdiction like Jersey in which
trusteeship is very much a business. By having a personal interest in a transaction which
conflicts with its fiduciary duty a trustee puts itself in such a position that it may be tempted
to stray from the straight and narrow path.
The no-conflict principal has been described as having a prophylactic quality31 in that for
the rule to bite it is enough that the trustee does something that has a tendency to interfere
with its overriding duty of fidelity to the beneficiaries. Indeed a fiduciary may be in breach
of the no-conflict rule in circumstances where the conduct engaged in has actually been
to the benefit of the object of the trustee's duty.32 The rule is based upon a generalised
consideration of risk, rather than one which requires a detailed assessment of whether the
fiduciary has actually succumbed to temptation with all the ancillary difficulty there may be
in actually determining that fact.33 A fiduciary can be in breach of the no-conflict rule even
though his or her conduct has been to the benefit of the beneficiaries. With this in mind it
becomes clear that the fairness or otherwise of the transaction is generally not a relevant
consideration as to whether the rule has been engaged.34 Nor is it relevant whether any gain
by the trustee was one that the beneficiaries could not have obtained for themselves.35 The
honesty or otherwise of the fiduciary is also irrelevant to the operation of the rule.36 Also
irrelevant is any question of morality on behalf of the trustee who may breach his fiduciary
duty without any subjective consciousness of wrongdoing.37
The no-conflict rule cannot be avoided by the fiduciary arranging a transaction in such a
way as to ensure a third party benefits from the conflict38 if there is an 'understanding or
agreement in honour, or in any other shape'39 with the effect that the third party is in fact
acting on behalf of the fiduciary.40
The no-conflict rule has very few exceptions. By statute, the trustee may only profit from his
office, in breach of the no-conflict principle with the approval of the Court or as authorised
by the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 or the terms of the trust instrument.41 The trustee may
also be absolved from liability for what would otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty by
obtaining the fully informed consent from the beneficiaries to act. The directors of Jersey
companies are also required to declare the existence, nature and extent of their interest in
a transaction with the company in which they are interested to other company directors,
usually with accompanying authorisation to act from the other directors.42

Conflicts of Interest

A trustee's conflict of interest is not generally cured, so as to release the trustee from liability
by making full disclosure to the beneficiaries without more. Rather, the trustee's obligation
is to desist from acting in a way that involves a conflict between its duty and its interest.
Full and frank disclosure coupled with the beneficiaries' informed consent is one of the
mechanisms by which the fiduciary can avoid liability and continue to act (if it wishes to
do so). While a trustee cannot be said to have preferred its interest to its duty in circumstances where it is completely unaware of its interest, that is not to say that a trustee cannot
hope to avoid the effect of the no-conflict rule by deliberately shutting its eyes or refraining
from acquiring information about a conflicting interest, or where it ought to have recognised the conflict. There are countless conceivable examples in which the no-conflict rule
is engaged. Several of the scenarios in which the no-conflict rule is engaged have become
sufficiently common in practice to have developed into recognised limbs of the no-conflict
rule: the prohibition against the trustee 'self-dealing' and the so called 'fair-dealing' rule.
The distinction between these rules, which clearly overlap, is that in the former instance the
trustee is transacting with itself while in the latter it is not.43 Both the self-dealing and fairdealing rules are essentially rules of equity that subject the trustee to a disability in respect
of transactions falling within their scope. This characterisation means that breaches of the
rules have been held44 (per curiam) in England not to fall within the scope of the six-year
limitation period in section 21 of the Limitation Act 1980. There is no Jersey authority as to
whether a breach of the self-dealing rule falls within or without the scope of Article 57(2)
of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.45

A. Self-dealing
8-13

The prohibition on a trustee self-dealing46 is that if a trustee sells the trust property to himself, the sale is voidable by any beneficiary as of right, however fair the transaction.47 That
is not to say that the trustee may never purchase the trust property but that the purchase is
always vulnerable to being set aside.48 That is so even if it was for a price higher than that
obtainable on the open market, or on terms which are generous to the trust.49 Any beneficiary may have the transaction set aside within a reasonable time after he discovers the
circumstances.50 This is the classic formulation of the prohibition on a trustee self-dealing;
however, the underlying principle clearly has a wider application to transactions other than

ibid, at 247-51.
45 A breach of trust is defined as a breach of any duty imposed on a trustee by this Law or by the terms of the
trust and Art 21(4) could be read as encompassing the self-dealing rule so than an action founded on a breach of
that article might be read as falling with Art 57(2). A breach of the self-dealing rule does not necessarily fit easily
within the definition of fraud for the purposes of Art 51(1) (although often such breaches will be deliberate rather
than negligent) but may encompass a claim to recover the trust property from the trustee (if the trustee is under
disability from acquiring the trust property by virtue of the self-dealing rule itself).

the purchase of trust property, for example a loan transaction51 or the vesting of trust property in a company of which the trustee, or an individual behind the trustee, is a director.52
The self-dealing principle is engaged not only in a case where the trustee purports to enter
a transaction on its own account, in its own name, or through an agent or nominee,53 but
also in a case where the trustee transacts with what appears to be a third party on a contract
or understanding that the third party will resell the trust property or otherwise indirectly
benefit the trustee. It will be an infringement of the self-dealing rule for the trustee to sell
trust property to a company which he has created for the purchase, if the company is the
alter ego for the trustee.54 A transaction between the trustee and a company in which the
trustee is a director is subject to the self-dealing rule as the trustee is acting on both sides
of the transaction.55 Such a transaction is also likely to amount to a conflict of duties. The
self-dealing rule will still apply whether the purchase by the trustee was from himself alone,
or from a co-trustee.56 However, if, instead of selling to himself, the trustee sells to a third
party, the trustee may repurchase the property from the third party without infringing the
rule against self-dealing provided that there was no arrangement or understanding between
the trustee and third party and that original sale was bona fides.57
Subject to the statutory derogation now found in Article 31(3) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984, a transaction in which a sole trustee purchases the trust property from himself may
be rendered void by the rule in Jersey law which requires there to be at least two parties to a
contract.58 Article 31(3) permits a trustee to contract with itself when contracting in their
capacity as trustee of different trusts. Where a trustee takes advantage of this provision, it is
still subject to its duties in Article 21. There is, as yet, no authority in Jersey as to how Article 31(3) and Article 21 can be reconciled; such a transaction is permeated by a conflict of
interest. At the time of going to press the States of Jersey has consulted as to whether Article
31(3) should be extended to allow a trustee to purchase trust property on its own account
as well. The qualification to Article 31 suggests that the provision is directed at avoiding the
effect of the technical rule that a contract without at least two parties to it is void. However,
the patent conflict of interest in such a transaction will usually be sufficient to allow the
beneficiary to avoid the transaction before recourse need be made to the technical twoparty rule.59

B. Fair-dealing
The fair-dealing rule is that instead of purchasing the trust property, the trustee purchases
the beneficial interest of any of his beneficiaries. The transaction is not voidable ex debito

justitiae, but may be set aside by the beneficiary unless the trustee can show that it has taken
no advantage of its position and has made full disclosure to the beneficiary, and that the
transaction is fair and honest.60 In reality, a scenario in which the fair-dealing rule will be
engaged is likely to be rare in Jersey as it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which a
professional trustee would have cause to purchase the beneficial interest of its beneficiary,
which, in the vast majority of cases is an interest of no value whatsoever if the beneficiary is
merely an object of the trustee's discretionary power.61
The fair-dealing rule and the self-dealing rule apply to different sorts of situations and
are therefore treated as distinct rules.62 However, the distinction between them is not
one of principle.63 Both are concerned with the conflict between the trustee's duty and
its interest. Under both rules the transaction may be saved but only if the trustee proves
that the beneficiaries consented after the trustee having made full and frank disclosure
of all material facts. The reference to fairness in respect of the self-dealing rule is not
substantive fairness in the transaction but the objective evidence as to what was disclosed so as to assist the court scrutinising the transaction in determining whether the
beneficiaries' consent was fully informed.64 A fair-dealing transaction may be upheld
notwithstanding an unequal exchange of value provided the beneficiaries consented
with full information to the transaction in that form.65 Like a self-dealing situation, a
fair-dealing transaction is said to be one of great delicacy, and one which the Court can
be expected to scrutinise very closely to determine whether the beneficiary's consent
truly was fully informed.

C. Profits by the Trustee
8-17

The second of the two major themes of fiduciary loyalty is the no-profit rule. It has long
been acknowledged that a trustee who obtains for itself an opportunity or advantage that
arises by virtue of its trusteeship or knowledge derived from that trusteeship66 is deemed
to be a constructive trustee of the opportunity obtained.67 The rule is the foundation of a
broad general principle that a trustee is not permitted to make or retain any unauthorised
profit or personal advantage for himself or for a third party by way of his position as trustee.
This prohibition is encapsulated in Article 21(4)(b) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 which
provides that a trustee must not directly or indirectly profit from the trustee's trusteeship;
cause or permit any other person to profit directly or indirectly from such trusteeship; or on
the trustee's own account enter into any transaction with the trustees or relating to the trust

property which may result in such profit. The no-profit rule may be regarded as a sub-rule
of the no-conflict rule as a trustee who is given the opportunity or who actually obtains a
profit in a transaction by virtue of their office inevitably places themselves in a position
where they prefer their own interest to their duty.
The essence of the no profit rule is that a fiduciary acts in breach of fiduciary duty where
he or she makes a profit by reason or in virtue of the fiduciary office or otherwise within
the scope of a fiduciary office.68 A trustee that does obtain an authorised profit is liable to
account for any benefit or gain obtained or received. The crucial point is not that the profit
that is made is the fruit of the trust property or the trusteeship (although in many cases the
trustee will also have taken advantage of the trust property or its position as trustee), but
that it is made in circumstances where a conflict exists and the profit falls within the scope
and ambit of the conflicting duty.
The rule will bite on the mere fact of the unauthorised profit having being made. As soon as
the advantage in question is shown to have been acquired by virtue of the trusteeship, the
trustee will hold it for the benefit of the beneficiaries.69 In the absence of express authorisation from the trust instrument or by the Court, the effect of the rule is that a trustee is
simply disabled from retaining the benefit of the opportunity arising on its own account.70
This disability is absolute and irrebuttable. It is irrelevant to the strict operation of this
principle that the trustee acted in good or bath faith or whether the actions of the trustee
were clandestine, whether or not the making of the profit involved skill or risk taking on
the part of the trustee; and whether or not the profit would have arisen for the benefit of
the beneficiaries in any event.71 This is because if a fiduciary could justify his or her conduct
on such a basis the temptation would be for the trustee to hold back from pressing the best
interests of the beneficiaries as strongly as it might otherwise do (which could itself amount
to a breach of duty) knowing that, if it did not meet its obligations, an opportunity to profit
for itself might then present itself. It is also irrelevant whether the fiduciary's conduct has
caused any loss to the trust fund72 as the beneficiaries may elect to require the trustee to

be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest conflicting, or which possibly may conflict, with the interest of those whom he is bound to protect. So strictly is this principle adhered to,

account for its profits to the beneficiaries even though it acted in good faith and, purportedly, in their interests.73

i. Renewal of Leases
8-20

As Jersey law does not admit of the possibility that Jersey immovable property may be held
directly by a trustee, the Royal Court has not expressed a view as to whether the principles espoused in Keech v Sandford,74 the leading decision on the renewal of leases, and in
Protheroe v Protheroe,75 the leading decision on the purchase of reversions, have any direct
application as part of Jersey law. That said, the principles in Keech v Sandford, while on its
facts directly not relevant in Jersey, are not entirely without application and may be relevant
when considering whether the no-profit rule is engaged by the trustee's renewal of a lease
in its own name outside Jersey. While the treatment of leases in Jersey trust law is one thing,
the broad principle found in Keech v Sandford, that a trustee may not make an unauthorised
profit from his fiduciary position has been applied in a wide variety of other scenarios.

ii. Bribes and Secret Commissions
8-21

It is a clear breach of fiduciary duty for a trustee to take a bribe, secret commissions, or
other like payment by whatever name, of a similar nature.76 The prohibition on receipt of
bribes or secret commissions applies to fiduciaries other than trustees as well.77 Absent fully
informed consent a director is liable to account for any profit which he makes personally
using his position as director of a company. An agent who takes a secret profit in the course
of his agency must account for it to his principal.78 A bribe consists in a commission or
other inducement, which is given by a third party to a fiduciary as such, and which is secret
from the person to whom the fiduciary owes its duties. It is immaterial for these purposes
whether the bribe was effective so as to actually influence the fiduciary's conduct.79 It is
in the nature of a bribe or secret commission that it is intended to induce the fiduciary to
do something it might not otherwise do.80 A bribe or secret commission is also recoverable under the no-profit rule as it amounts to an unauthorised payment obtained by the
fiduciary as a result of its fiduciary position, and so it is unnecessary to show the bribe as
being effective so as to give rise to an actual conflict between duty and interest; the mere
fact of the bribe is sufficient.81 It is irrelevant whether the paying party acted with a corrupt

motive or intent.82 The trustee's honesty is also irrelevant to his liability to account to the
beneficiaries.83
Without authorisation, a trustee is required to disgorge any profit he gains by using his
position as trustee to procure for itself remunerative employment. This is a particular
risk for Jersey trustees where a trustee that itself or as part of a group also provides regulated funds or investment services which it procures in which to invest the trust assets.
Another example would be where a trustee appoints itself, or one of its own directors or
employees, as a remunerated director of an underlying company by using the voting rights
attached to shares which form part of the trust fund. Where a trustee receives a payment
from an incoming trustee who replaces him as trustee, the payment, in so far as it does
not amount to reasonable security for the trustee's reasonable remuneration and costs
reasonably incurred, to which the trustee is entitled,84 is deemed to be an impermissible
profit which had come to it only as a result of its fiduciary position and is therefore taken
in breach of fiduciary duty and is subject to the remedies available in respect of breach of
the no-profit rule.
The obligation to account for the bribe arises from the fiduciary relationship, rather than
from any principle of privity of contract, and so binds sub-agents and the principal between
whom no privity may exist.85 A Jersey trustee may authorise an agent to whom it can delegate management of the trust property to retain any commission or other payment usually
payable in relation to any transaction.86 However, the trustee remains accountable to the
beneficiaries for any such authorisation.

iii. Use of Trust Property to Trustee's own Benefit
If a trustee makes use of the trust fund in a commercial venture in which it is also personally
involved or uses it to speculate, the trustee will be liable for all the losses and the beneficiary
will be entitled to all gains arising thereon. If a trustee buys a debt against the trust estate
for less than its nominal value, the trustee is accountable for the profit it has made unless it
had first obtained the beneficiary's fully informed consent.87 Similarly, if a trustee receives a
benefit as a result of the fact that he holds the trust property, he must account for that benefit to the beneficiaries. An example of the latter would be the historic practice of pooling
trust treasury functions to obtain the benefit of a higher interest rate. If the benefit of that
higher rate resulted in a financial return by way of an undisclosed retrocession arrangement
with the bank, the trustee would be liable to account for that.

III. Conflicts of Duties
8-25

8-26

8-27

A fiduciary who acts for two principals to whom he owes conflicting duties, without the
informed consent of both, acts in breach of fiduciary duty.88 The possibility for a conflict
of duties arising in a Jersey trust structure may become particularly acute where officers
or employees of the corporate trustee serve as directors on boards of underlying companies forming part of the trust structure or on boards of client companies outside the trust.
Regardless of what may be going on within the trust structure that could give rise to a
conflict, such individuals are in an inherent position of conflict as they will owe duties to
both their ultimate employer but also (and which must take primacy) to the companies on
which they serve as directors.
A conflict of duties arises where, instead of the trustee in its personal capacity being party
to the impugned transaction, the trustee acts as principal (as trustee) or in some other representative capacity. The concern is not so much the potential for temptation on the part of
the conflicted trustee, but that the trustee, who is under a duty to act in the best interests of
both principals, cannot hope to discharge that obligation of undivided loyalty equally. In
the discharge of its duties it must inevitably further the interests of one set of beneficiaries
to the prejudice of the interests of the others. Thus the doctrine prohibits a trustee from
acting, not only where there is a conflict between the trustee's duty and its interest, but also
where there is a conflict between the trustee's duties to multiple sets of beneficiaries.
The leading Jersey authority on the conflicts of duties is In re E, L, O & R Trusts.89 The case
concerns 12 family trusts sharing a single trustee. Four of the trusts (the H Trusts) were for
the benefit of one branch of the family, the other eight were held for the benefit of the other
half (the J Trusts). The trusts between them held the same asset; a majority shareholding in
a UK holding company, the first four trusts holding approximately 20 per cent of the shares
and the remaining eight trusts holding 69 per cent. The trustee did not divide the family
shareholding in the company as that would have reduced the overall value of the trusts.
One of the beneficiaries of the latter eight trusts was the company's chairman and CEO.
In 2006, a dispute arose between the H and J Trust beneficiaries concerning the affairs of
the company and proceedings for unfair prejudice before the English High Court had been
threatened. The beneficiaries of the H and J Trusts had attempted to reach a settlement. If
they succeeded, negotiations would be necessary on behalf of all the family trusts to enable
a division or buy-out of the shares in the company, in which the trustee would owe conflicting duties to the beneficiaries of the H and J family trusts as it held all the shares in the
underlying company. When requested to do so on the grounds of its conflicted position,
the trustee refused to resign but acknowledged that there was potential for a conflict and, in
view of the competing interests of the beneficiaries of the family trusts, proposed to seek the
directions of the Court as to whether it should resign. In early 2007, the trustee unexpectedly withdrew its Representation for directions and maintained its refusal to resign. Later
in 2007, the beneficiaries brought fresh proceedings seeking the trustee's removal citing its

conflicted position. Shortly before that Representation was due to be heard in mid-2008,
the trustee agreed to resign on terms that its remuneration and legal costs incurred in connection with the two sets of proceedings should be paid out of the trust funds.
It was held that the trustee had been in a position of obvious conflict of duties and should
have retired when the dispute between the H and J Trusts arose as the beneficiaries had
conflicting interests: there was a real prospect of litigation, in which the H and J trusts were
likely to be opposing parties.90 The trustee owed a duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries of
both the H and the J family trusts and when exercising its powers and duties in respect of
each of the family trusts, the trustee had to have regard solely to the interests of the beneficiaries of those trusts. A fiduciary who acted for two principals91 with conflicting interests
without their informed consent to do so is in breach of its obligation of undivided loyalty
to each. In re E, L, O & R Trusts the conflict of duties has escalated to an actual conflict.
However, the Court held that even if a fiduciary properly acted for two principals with
potentially conflicting interests it should not be inhibited by the existence of its other duties
from serving the interests of one principal as faithfully and effectively as if it were its sole
principal. In a case such as this where an actual conflict of duties had materialised prior to
the trustee taking the necessary steps to avoid it, the trustee might have no alternative but
to cease to act for one or preferably both trusts.
In the present case, the conflict of interest had been so obvious that the trustee's refusal to
retire without the directions of the Court had been unreasonable. When requested to retire,
the trustee should have considered the principles applied by the Court on an application
to remove a trustee-namely, that it would be guided by the welfare of the beneficiaries
and the competent administration of the trust in their favour: a trustee would be removed
for misconduct which endangered the trust property or showed a want of honesty, proper
capacity to execute his duties or reasonable fidelity; and a trustee would not be removed for
mere friction or hostility with the beneficiaries unless it was caused by the trustee's administration of the trust. The court could, of course, remove a trustee who failed to recognise
a conflict of interest.
As the conflict of duties had been so obvious, there had been no justification for the trustee's Representation seeking the directions of the Court. The costs of that Representation
were therefore unreasonably incurred and outwith the scope the trustee's right of indemnity and the trustee was not entitled to charge remuneration for its time incurred in respect
of them. The trustee was also ordered to pay the costs of the other parties incurred in those
proceedings. As the second Representation had only been brought because of the trustee's
unreasonable refusal to retire, the trustee was ordered to bear its own costs and not to
charge for time spent on the Representation. It would also be ordered to pay the costs of the
other parties on the indemnity basis.
The Court was keen to stress that although the conflict in In re E, L, O & R Trusts had been
very obvious and it had been unreasonable of the trustee not to have retired as soon as
that conflict materialised or the possibility of it became apparent, a trustee faced with an
90 In fact the only active parties to any unfair prejudice application would be the trustee as both the minority
and majority shareholder; plaintiff and defendant respectively.
91 The judgment refers to the beneficiaries as the trustee's principal; however, this is not technically accurate as
the trustee is not an agent for the beneficiaries and always acts as principal.

allegation of conflict of interest was entitled to make reasonable inquiries and to take legal
advice on whether a conflict existed and whether he should retire. He should respond reasonably promptly to such an allegation but it would not necessarily be reasonable to expect
him to reach a decision forthwith. It would often be entirely reasonable for a trustee to seek
a decision from the Court before agreeing to retire or resolving to oppose an application for
his removal. Whether it is reasonable to seek directions depends upon the tenability of the
trustee's position. In many cases, even if the Court decided that the trustee should retire or
be removed, it would not conclude that he should be deprived of his costs or remuneration
if the trustee's conduct had otherwise been reasonable. In general, a trustee acting in good
faith in what he perceived to be the best interests of the trust and the beneficiaries as a whole
would not be deprived of his costs unless he acted unreasonably.
In re E, L, O & R Trusts one of the grounds on which the beneficiaries insisted the trustee
resign was that the trustee was or would be privy to information concerning the underlying dispute in one capacity that would be relevant to the interests of its other beneficiaries.
However, there appears to be no reliance upon or discussion in the judgment of the application of the provision in Article 31(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 that a trustee who
acts as trustee of more than one trust shall not, in the absence of fraud, be affected by notice
of any instrument, matter, fact or thing in relation to any particular trust if the trustee has
obtained notice of it by reason of it acting or having acted for the purposes of another trust.

A. Potential Conflict of Duties
8-33

8-34

It will be an automatic breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty to act for beneficiaries who
have potentially conflicting interests without their informed consent.92 It is unnecessary for
the two interests, and the duties which the fiduciary therefore owes to each, actually to be in
conflict. It is sufficient to constitute a breach of fiduciary duty if the fiduciary puts itself in a
position where its duty to one set of beneficiaries may conflict with his duty to the other.93
Even with the beneficiaries' informed consent to act, the trustee is nonetheless obliged to
act in good faith and in the best interests of each and must not act with the intention of furthering the interests of one to the prejudice of the interests of the other.94 A fiduciary need
not act dishonestly95 to still be held in breach of this requirement (although dishonestly will
do) but nonetheless act intentionally or consciously in favour of one side over the other.
However, the rule will not be breached where there is incompetence as this will amount
only to an unconscious omission.96 In Bristol & West Building Society v Mothew, the principle that was said to be engaged by the prohibition on acting in conflict of duties is that the
fiduciary must not be inhibited by the existence of his other employment from serving the
interests of his principal as faithfully and effectively as if he were the only employer. Where
the trustee acts, unconscious of the conflict of duties, he will not be consciously preferring
the interests of one master over those of another.

Conflicts in the Exercise of Powers

341

Even if a trustee has properly obtained the informed consent of its beneficiaries to act in
circumstances where it would otherwise be subject to a conflict of duties, and has not intentionally favoured the interests of one set of beneficiaries over those of the other, the trustee
must take care not to find itself in a position where there is, as in In re E, L, O & R Trusts, an
actual conflict of duty so that it cannot actually, or even hope to, fulfil its obligations to one
set of beneficiaries without failing in its obligations to the other beneficiaries.97 A fiduciary
who finds himself in such a position will generally be required to cease acting in at least
one capacity and potentially both, and preferably both.98 The fact that he cannot fulfil his
obligations to one principal without acting in breach of his obligations to the other is not
a defence.99

8-35

IV. Conflicts of Interest in the Exercise of Powers
The precise application of the no-conflict, no-profit and self-dealing rules to the exercise
of powers vested in trustees or other power holders under Article 9A of the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984 requires a careful analysis as to the precise construction and nature of the power.
Whether the no-conflict rule applied at all to the exercise of powers has, in the past, been
closely aligned with an analysis as to whether the power (whether administrative or dispositive) is fiduciary in character or not. If the power was fiduciary, then it was said that the
trustee could not exercise it in his own favour, thereby avoiding the issue of engagement
with the no-conflict rule.100 Conversely when the power was non-fiduciary in character
the no-conflict rule had no application. There is no necessary or easy correlation between
whether a power is fiduciary, special, limited or personal (sometimes seen described as a
beneficial or simple power) in nature and whether the power is administrative or dispositive.101 The inclusion of the donee of the power within the class of persons capable of benefiting from its exercise may, on an argument as to the construction of the power, be used to
suggest it was not intended to be fiduciary but the donee's inclusion does not, as a matter of
principle, prevent the power from being fiduciary in nature if the settlor has so designated it
to be so. The traditional shortcut analysis has in any event been thrown into doubt in light
of the English Court of Appeal decision in Edge v Pensions Ombudsman.102
The prohibition against trustees self-dealing or profiting themselves has no application to
the exercise of beneficial or limited powers since the holders of such powers have, generally,
no fiduciary duties in relation to their exercise. While the exercise of limited powers is still
subject to the doctrine of fraud on a power and the requirement that the donee is required

to exercise it bona fides for an authorised object,103 if the donee of a non-fiduciary power
is, as a matter of construction, an object of it, then the power is properly to be classed as
a beneficial power, and the doctrine of fraud on a power does not operate to preclude an
exercise in favour of the donee.104

A. Administrative Powers
8-38

8-39

Where the relevant power is an administrative power the general duty of the trustee is to
act in the best interests of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries as a whole, acting
impartially as between them, including themselves if the trustee is a beneficiary. The noconflict rule is capable of applying to administrative powers and it is not difficult to imagine
examples where, absent the no-conflict rule, an abuse of the trustee's position might occur.
For example, if the no-conflict rule did not apply the trustee could exercise its powers of
investment to invest the trust property in its own financial products or business or exercise
a power of amendment to increase the trustee's remuneration105 or exercise a power to borrow money from the trustee or the trustee's associated companies at interest.106
The application of the principle that a trustee or other fiduciary, such as a protector, should
not exercise a power vested in them where to do so would be in breach of the no-conflict
rule presupposes that the power holder is authorised to act. The approach to be taken in
the case of administrative powers is that a donee of such a power may only act in a way in
which the donee is authorised to act by the terms of the power. If the terms of the trust or
power expressly or impliedly prohibit the exercise of the power then any exercise that is
outside the four corners of the power is void as ultra vires. On one view, the effect of the noconflict rule is therefore to be considered as impliedly excluding the power holder from the
category of persons in whose favour, or with whom, the power holder can lawfully deal.107
If the purported exercise of the power is ultra vires then ipso facto its exercise contrary to the
no-conflict rule is not an issue. Put another way, as it applies to fiduciary or special powers,
it may be instructive to regard the no-conflict rule as operating in a similar fashion to the
rule against excessive execution of powers. However, this analysis is quite reductionist and
the generally accepted view is that the exercise of a power contrary to the prohibition on a
fiduciary exercising a power in breach of the no-conflict rule is that the power is voidable at
the insistence of the beneficiaries and not void.108

Where the power is dispositive, such as powers of advancement or powers of appointment,

be partial in the exercise of such powers. It is not at all clear whether the no-conflict rule
operates in the same way in relation to dispositive powers as it does to administrative powers and it may be that the analysis to be had has a closer affinity with that applicable to
beneficial powers. Unlike a beneficial power, in relation to dispositive powers the donee's
discretion is tempered by the requirement for them to exercise such powers from to time,
and to exercise them in good faith, taking into account relevant considerations but excluding from its mind irrelevant, irrational or improper considerations.109 Where the donee of
a dispositive power is outside the class of persons in whose favour it may be exercised and
purports to exercise it for its own benefit, the power is void as either excessive or fraudulent. If the donee of the dispositive power is within the class then the no-conflict rule has
no application as it is the manifest intention of the creator of the power that the donee is
capable of benefiting from an exercise of it in its own favour.
There is English Court of Appeal authority110 to the effect that it is possible, in the terms
of the trust instrument itself, to authorise a trustee who is also a beneficiary, to exercise a
dispositive power under which the trustee himself can benefit (or benefit from its nonexercise) even though such a power is usually properly to be regarded as fully fiduciary.
Where such a situation arises, the extent of the trustee's duties are modified but the effect
is not to free the trustee from any fiduciary obligations in relation to the exercise (or nonexercise) of the power. That a trustee is also an object of the power under which it is able
to benefit does not impose upon the trustee a heightened burden to show the exercise is
rational and proper. That burden falls to those seeking to challenge its exercise.111 However,
where there is no express authorisation in the trust instrument for the trustee to benefit
itself, a trustee is usually barred from exercising fiduciary dispositive powers in its own
favour, and any purported exercise of the power in favour of a trustee is either void, or voidable as of right on the application of a beneficiary prejudiced by it.112 It would seem them
that irrespective of whether the power in question is fiduciary or not, any challenge to its
exercise is less to do with the no-conflict rule and more to do with whether the exercise is
excessive or fraudulent.113
In the context of private trusts, it has been recognised that a trustee might be capable of
benefiting under a power vested in the trustees while at the same time being subject to
duties which do not apply in the case of merely personal powers.114 Taken as a whole, the
modern English authorities, which in the absence of Jersey authority are likely to be persuasive,115 do recognise that a trustee can be authorised by the terms of the trust instrument
to exercise a power vested in them (including dispositive powers) by virtue of being trustee
in their own favour. The older analysis with its automatic bifurcation of the nature of the

power in question being dependent upon its object is no longer to be regarded as good law.
A power that a trustee may exercise in favour of itself does not automatically render that
power a personal or beneficial power. It is possible to have a power vested in a trustee by
virtue of its office which is subject to the general duties applicable to fiduciary powers (such
as the duty to consider periodically whether or not to exercise the power) while simultaneously including the trustee within the class of eligible objects in whose favour the power
may be exercised-or who may benefit from its non-exercise.
The fact that a power is capable of being exercised in favour of a person upon whom it is
conferred is usually an important, but not necessarily determinative indicator whether a
power is to be construed as a mere personal power or a fiduciary power. Where a power of
appointment or other dispositive power is conferred on a trustee by virtue of their office, it
is a fiduciary power. While that may determine whether the power is fiduciary in character,
as discussed above, that does not determine the question as to whether a trustee can benefit
under it.
It might be thought that the question whether a trustee is eligible to benefit under a fiduciary dispositive power is purely one of construction of the relevant power, as in the case of
a personal power, so that if as a matter of construction the trustee is an object of the power
it may be exercised in his favour, otherwise not. If as a matter of construction a trustee was
an object of a fiduciary dispositive power, it could be exercised in his favour because it is
an object. The self-dealing rule would have no application as its effect would be to thwart
the settlor's intention. If as a matter of construction, the trustee was not an object of such a
power, the question of the application of the self-dealing rule does not arise, as the trustee is
in any event not an object of the power and ineligible to benefit from its exercise. While this
is the approach in respect of non-fiduciary powers of appointment, it is not the approach
to be adopted in respect of dispositive powers conferred on trustees by virtue of their office,
which are fiduciary in character.
The self-dealing rule is not confined only to the exercise of administrative powers.116 A
number of the authorities indicate that the self-dealing rule applies to the exercise of fiduciary dispositive powers as well.117 A power conferred on trustees, for example, to distribute a
fund to such persons as they think fit, is likely to be limited by the self-dealing rule so as to
prevent the trustee from distributing the trust fund to itself.118 The breadth of such a fiduciary dispositive power is limited by the self-dealing rule in the same way as an administrative
fiduciary power to appoint a new trustee is to be read as preventing the donee appointing
itself, even if, as a matter of pure construction of the relevant power there appears nothing
on the face of the power which shows that it is not to be exercised in favour of the donee.119
While by default the self-dealing rule may limit the exercise of a fiduciary dispositive power,
the self-dealing rule may be excluded by the terms of the trust instrument so as to enable
a trustee to benefit from its exercise (or non-exercise).120 Two exceptions are of particular

significance that authorise the trustees to benefit under them. One is that the rule does
not apply where the trustee has not placed himself in the position of conflict but has been
placed in that position by the terms of trust. The other is that the rule may be excluded by
the terms of the trust. The self-dealing rule has been described, in the context of dispositive powers, as one under which a trustee cannot act if he finds himself in a position where
he owes conflicting duties, or where his duty conflicts with his interest.121 But the more
accurate description of the rule is that a trustee is not allowed to place himself in a position
where there is a conflict between his duty and interest, or his duty in different capacities.
The self-dealing rule therefore does not apply where the trustee has not placed himself in
a position of conflict but that the conflict has been thrust upon the trustee by the terms of
the trust. Where this exception to the self-dealing rule applies, a fiduciary dispositive power
is capable of exercise in favour of the trustee.122 The conflict is the product of the terms of
the trust, not the result of the trustees placing themselves in a position of conflict of interest thereby excluding the self-dealing rule and apparently also the no-profit rule. Another
example of the operation of this exception is where a fiduciary power is conferred on the
trustee exercisable in favour of beneficiaries other than the trustee, but the trustee is interested in default of exercise of the power. A conflict will inevitably arise between the trustee's
interest in not exercising the power and his duty in considering its exercise.123
In the context of fiduciary dispositive powers, the self-dealing and no-profit rules may be
expressly excluded by the terms of the trust124 or impliedly excluded where that is necessary in order to give efficacy to the terms of the trust.125 Whether these exclusions to the
no-conflict rule apply, the powers in question remain fiduciary notwithstanding that they
may be exercised in the donee's favour and so the donee must still give proper periodic consideration to their exercise in favour of other beneficiaries, and cannot simply have regard
to their own interests, as is permissible in the case of a personal power in respect of which
the donee is an object.
Where the self-dealing rule is or may by engaged by the proposed exercise of a dispositive
power, the Royal Court has jurisdiction to direct the trustee to exercise the power notwithstanding that in exercising it the trustee will benefit. Such a direction is obtained by way of
a Representation under Article 51(2)(a)(ii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.126 The Royal
Court will only do so in a proper case, and will usually give preliminary directions that all
interested parties are to be separately represented. There is extensive case law in Jersey that
the Court will refuse an application for directions by a trustee in a Public Trustee v Cooper127
category two case (a momentous decision) where the trustee is subject to a conflict of
interest.128 To obtain the relief the trustee may have to surrender a full discretion to the

Court,129 although such cases are likely to generate more expense and take longer to
resolve.130 The Court may only exercise its jurisdiction to give directions in a case where
the trustee is not an object of the power. What the Court is doing in supplying its approval
to the proposed course is to remove the disability applying to the trustee by reason of the
no-conflict rule. The Court does not have jurisdiction (outside Article 47 and then only
with the approval of all the adult beneficiaries) to extend the dispositive powers already in
existence in the terms of the trust.

V. Defences
A. Authorisation by Trust Instrument
8-49

The terms of a trust instrument may expressly or impliedly authorise a trustee to act in
circumstances where its interests and its duties conflict.131

B. Concurrence of the Beneficiaries
8-50

A trustee's fiduciary duties exist to protect the beneficiaries' interests and the beneficiaries may elect to forgo that protection but authorising or directing the trustee to act in a
way that would otherwise be prohibited by the trustee's fiduciary duties.132 To provide the
trustee with a complete release and defence to any claim for breach duty, the beneficiaries'
consent must be fully informed and freely given.133 The trustee will be unable to obtain a
full release if the beneficial class is not closed and/or, at the time consent is sought, it contains minor or interdict beneficiaries who are unable to give consent.134 The trustee bears
the burden of establishing that the beneficiaries' consent is informed and freely given.135
However, consent may be inferred from circumstances that are sufficiently clear to justify
it.136 Subscribing to the principle that sunlight is often the best disinfectant, the trustee is
required to provide the beneficiaries with full and frank disclosure of all material facts pertaining to the conflict and the Court will jealously guard the beneficiaries' consent.137 The

information that the trustee is required to disclose to the beneficiaries goes wider than that
which would be decisive (which obviously must be disclosed) and includes anything that
may have affected the beneficiaries' willingness to consent.138 It is therefore not a defence for
the trustee, having failed to give full disclosure, to seek to argue that the beneficiaries would
have consented notwithstanding the non-disclosure.139 The trustee is required to disclosure
the nature and extent of its interest in the transaction and not merely the existence of an
interest that conflicts with its duty.140 It has increasingly been the tendency of the Commission to regard disclosure that is undertaken in a formulistic rather than functional way
as being inadequate as a tool for managing conflicts of interest and the trustee should not
make formulistic assumptions about the intelligence or sophistication of the beneficiaries.

C. Authorisation by the Court
The Royal Court may sanction a transaction or proposed course of conduct by the trustee
that would otherwise constitute a breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty.141 Proceedings for
such approval are typically commenced by way of Representation. Such approval is discretionary, not as of right and is typically sought in advance of the particular transaction. The
Court must be persuaded that the trustee has not taken advantage of its position and has
not been influenced by the conflict in its position. It is a consistent criterion in the Jersey
authorities concerning the Court's jurisdiction to sanction or bless a momentous decision
of the trustee that the trustee has come to the Court without conflict.142 Where the trustee is
operating under a conflict of interest, it must disclose this to the Court and may, by reason
of that conflict, have limited practical options that are palatably alternative to surrendering
its discretion to the Court.143 The Court is likely to be unsympathetic and may refuse to
sanction the trustee's conflict or to give the trustee directions where directions are sought
after the fact, particularly where the conflict is an obvious one.144

Conflicts of Interest

v Vautier,146 a lay trustee of a Jersey is not be entitled to remuneration for its services.147
However, where the terms of a trust are silent as to his or her remuneration, a professional
trustee is entitled to reasonable remuneration for services that the professional trustee provides.148 In practice, trusteeship in Jersey is and has always been a remunerated and not a
gratuitous office. Statutory provision for the remuneration of trustees is a significant exception to the prohibition in Article 21(4)(b)(i) that a trustee must not profit from its office.
Article 26(1A) therefore places a professional trustee in the position of being able to charge
for their services by default. This is a more generous position than that currently prevailing
in England under the Trustee Act 2000, which provides that a professional trustee is not
entitled, in the absence of express authorisation by the terms of the trust instrument or
by order of the court or by the beneficiaries (and apart from one exception in the case of a
solicitor-trustee), to charge for its services.

B. Remuneration of Director of Corporate Trustee
8-53

A director of a corporate trustee who is engaged and paid by the trustee to act in connection
with the trust is not directly accountable to the beneficiaries for such remuneration, and
the trustee may recover the director's remuneration as an expense of the trust reasonably
incurred, if such fees come within the scope of expenses allowed by the terms and conditions on which the trustee acts.

C. Nature of Trustee's Rights under Remuneration Provisions
8-54

The right of a trustee to remuneration under an express provision in the trust instrument
is to some extent regarded as a beneficial interest.149 The trustee's entitlement to remuneration is not in the nature of a contract and a charging provision in the trust instrument, even
if executed by the settlor, does not entitle the trustee to sue the settlor for satisfaction of its
fees.150 In circumstances where the trust is declared to be invalid after its commencement
and the trustee has drawn remuneration from the fund, the trustee is not to be required
to repay that remuneration if the Court otherwise regards it as being reasonable notwithstanding that in finding the trust to be invalid the effect of a charging provision would
fall away.151 However, the right of a trustee to remuneration is not regarded as a beneficial

collateral agreement alongside the trust instrument that entitles the trustee to recover fees from some source other
than the trust fund where the trust assets are illiquid, such as real estate or a debt which cannot easily be realised
without placing the trustee in a position where it may have to prefer its own interest in the recovery of fees at the
expense of upsetting the way the trust assets have been structured.

interest in the fund for all purposes. For the purpose of the Court's jurisdiction to vary the
terms of a trust, under Article 47 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 a remuneration provision
is treated as being of an administrative rather than beneficial character.152
The trustee's right to remuneration is also of a different quality from the trustee's entitlement to be reimbursed or indemnified from the trust assets in respect of the trustee's reasonable costs and expenses conferred by the general law and confirmed in Article 26 of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law.153 A charging clause entitles the trustee to deduct its reasonable charges
in priority to making distributions out to beneficiaries. But, unlike the trustee's indemnity,
and subject to contrary provision in the instrument itself, it is not in the nature of an equitable charge over or proprietary interest in the trust fund that persists after the trustee has
parted with the trust property.154
Upon retirement, a trustee whose fees are disputed, is entitled, as with costs in respect of
which it is entitled to an indemnity but which have not yet fallen due, to reasonable security
to ensure that it receives any fees ultimately found to be due but is not entitled to greater
protection by way of reasonable security than is necessary.155

8-56

D. Effect of a Breach of Trust on the Trustee's Right to Remuneration
A trustee is not deprived of his right to remuneration under a charging clause merely
because he has committed a breach of his duties as trustee.156 The authors are doubtful
whether a trustee can charge remuneration in respect of a transaction which involves a
dishonest breach of trust or in respect of a transaction that is unauthorised by the trust
fund.157 A trustee would not be entitled to an indemnity in respect of such a transaction
either at any rate unless the transaction has benefited the trust fund.

8-57

E. Challenging a Trustee's Charges
The beneficiaries are entitled, at their own risk as to costs, to subject the trustee's charges to
scrutiny by way of an assessment before the Royal Court.158 An assessment is not a formal
taxation of the trustee's fees and the scales applicable on a taxation are not relevant. The
Greffier is likely to be concentrating on two aspects, namely, whether a particular matter is
one upon which it was reasonable to spend time; and secondly, whether the degree of time
spent on a particular matter was reasonable. The test is not whether the Greffier thinks

the fees were incurred at the right level; it is whether they were reasonably incurred. Put
another way, they may only be disallowed if they were unreasonably incurred. The Court
expects a trustee to have regard to the value of the funds and to keep its remuneration at
a level which is proportionate to that amount. A trustee is not entitled to its time costs
incurred defending itself in a hostile dispute with the beneficiaries; the position is consistent with that applicable to legal fees in this context. Any doubts that the Greffier might
have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or of a reasonable amount should be
resolved in favour of the trustee.
The trustee will be liable to account for any charges on the fund insofar they are unreasonable or excessive. The Royal Court, but not the Judicial Greffier, has jurisdiction under both
Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 and under its inherent jurisdiction to order the
production of documents by the trustee to enable the beneficiaries to decide whether to
challenge trustees' fees.159 A Jersey trustee, in accordance with the Codes of Practice for
Trust Company Business, issued by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, is required
to be open and transparent in its fee structure. A trustee is expected to render regular and
prompt invoices for its fees.160 Unless the trustee provides the beneficiaries with a full
breakdown of its fees the beneficiaries are not obliged to do so unless and until an itemisation is provided.161

F. Remuneration Authorised by Order of the Court

The Court has both a statutory and an inherent jurisdiction to authorise, increase or vary
the remuneration of a trustee. However the Court's jurisdiction to authorise remuneration
is, of less practical importance than formerly following the enactment of Article 26(1A) of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.162
The Court has an inherent jurisdiction, to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases,163
to authorise increase or vary the payment of remuneration to a trustee.164 This jurisdiction
may be exercised not only to award remuneration upon or after the appointment of a trustee where there is no provision in the trust instrument. The Court has an inherent power
to secure the good administration of trusts.165 The Court will not exercise its jurisdiction
unless it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature
of the trust, the experience and skill of a particular trustee and the amounts which he seeks
to charge, that it would be in the interests of the good administration of the trust, and therefore of the beneficiaries, to award or increase the trustee's remuneration.166 The Court has

beneficiaries or approval under Article 47(3) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 on behalf of
other beneficiaries.167
In the absence of provision in the trust instrument, the Court is likely to be easily persuaded of the desirability to authorise remuneration, if the application is supported or not
opposed by the beneficiaries represented in the proceedings.168 The Court is more rather
than less likely to hold that in electing to use a professional Jersey trustee, the settlor and
the beneficiaries can be deemed to have expected to pay the charges of a professional trust
company and, subject to consideration of the amount, the identity of the trustee was irrelevant.169 The Court has been persuaded to do so even where the application is opposed by
the beneficiaries and the trustee is an unlicensed trust company which inadvertently failed
to transfer the trusteeship to another trust company which acted as though the trusteeship
had been transferred.170

G. Allowance for Skill and Labour of Trustee who is Liable to Account for
Profits
If a trustee (or other fiduciary) becomes liable to account for profits made by reason of its
position as trustee, then the Court, in granting the appropriate remedy against the trustee
(or other fiduciary), has a discretion to allow the trustee remuneration by way of an allowance for the trustee's skill or labour in obtaining the profit which will be offset against the
profits for which he is liable to account.171

H. The Duration of the Trustee's Entitlement to Remuneration
A trustee's right to remuneration under a charging clause continues until the trust assets
have been distributed by the trustee to the beneficiaries or at least until the expiry of a reasonable time for the trustee to effect the distribution.172 If the trustee retires or is removed
from office, it is doubtful, given the absence of any mechanism under Jersey law to effect an
automatic vesting of assets, whether the trustee has any right to remuneration thereafter.
The trustee's unreasonable refusal to retire pending settlement of a dispute as to fees may
also have a prejudicial effect on his right to remuneration.173

VII. Remedies

Breach of the no-profit or no-conflicts rules carries a range of potential remedies which
include the rescission of a transaction vitiated by the conflict, actions for an account of
profits made in breach of the trustee's duty, the imposition of a proprietary constructive
trust on the proceeds of the transaction, and the payment of compensation for loss caused
by the breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty. Some of these remedies treat the trustee's
duties as being in the nature of a disability and some treat breach of the trustee's duties as
wrongdoing. While this distinction is not universally endorsed,174 it is nonetheless illustrative of the different ways in which fiduciary duties operate.
The remedies of rescission, accounts of profits and proprietary constructive trusts operate
on the basis that the fiduciary was under a disability, in the sense that the trustee ought
not to have entered into the transaction or taken the unauthorised profit except for the
benefit of the beneficiaries. That justifies the beneficiaries applying to reverse the relevant
transaction, by rescinding it. Alternatively, the beneficiaries can seek to strip the trustee
of any profit which it made from the impugned transaction by way of an account of that
profit or by way of proceedings for a declaration that the profit or its traceable proceeds
is impressed with a constructive trust. A trustee who has taken an unauthorised profit is
obliged to account for that profit that was obtained in breach of its duty of utmost good
faith without the Court needing to determine whether the principal might have been prepared to give consent, had it been sought. If the trustee did not seek, or failed to obtain, fully
informed consent from the beneficiaries that it should profit on its own account, it should
not have proceeded with the transaction other than for the benefit of the beneficiaries and
the trustee cannot seek to defend itself by relying on its own failure to obtain such consent
as a justification for reducing its liability to account for profit. The principles of causation
are not otherwise relevant to the assessment of a fiduciary's liability to account for profits.
Where compensatory remedy is sought, the claim for breach of fiduciary duty has more of
the characteristics that the fiduciary has committed wrongdoing by acting with a conflict
in preferring its interest to its duties to the beneficiaries and that wrong has caused loss to
the trust fund. In contrast with those remedies discussed in the preceding paragraph, the
plaintiff beneficiaries' position is relevant, in that a beneficiary cannot recover from the
trustee loss which would have been suffered in any event. The loss must be shown to have
been caused by the breach of fiduciary duty. Thus, it becomes important to assess how the
plaintiff beneficiaries would have acted but for the trustee's breach of its fiduciary duty, in a
way that is unimportant where the disability-based remedies are sought.
The beneficiaries are entitled to elect the most advantageous remedy to them but must
elect between remedies that are inconsistent with one another, although they may claim
remedies that are inconsistent with one another if they plead them in the alternative.175 For
example, an account of the profits made by a defendant trustee in breach of his fiduciary

obligations and equitable compensation in the nature of damages for the loss suffered by
reason of the same breach. The former remedy is measured by the wrongdoer's gain, the
latter by the injured party's loss.176

A. An Account of Profits
A trustee, as with any other fiduciary, is not, without authorisation, permitted to make
or retain,177 and is bound to account for any profit that it receives in breach of fiduciary
duty.178 The beneficiaries' entitlement to an account of profits which have been made in
breach of fiduciary duty, while in principle at the discretion of the Court, is in practice
ordered virtually as of right. A company, or member of a company, is entitled to bring
proceedings ordering an account of profits from a director that has entered into a transaction with the company and failed to disclose his interest.179 The trustee's liability to account
extends to the actual net profit whether in the nature of income or capital. The profits for
which the fiduciary must account must bear some reasonable relationship to the breach of
fiduciary duty.180 The proper analysis is that the trustee's obligation is to account for profits
which have been made in breach of fiduciary duty, not to account for profits in some abstract
sense.181 One of the first questions in any proper analysis is to ascertain precisely what is it
that has been acquired in consequence of the trustee's breach of fiduciary duty.
In simple cases, such as where the trustee has sold or purchased trust assets the account
of profits will take into account all moneys which the trustee has received in the transaction sought to be impugned, set against all expenses reasonably incurred in respect of the
transaction which the trustee has incurred. Where the trustee has taken a secret profit in
the transaction, the beneficiaries may surcharge the incoming side of the account with the
profit that the trustee has obtained but not accounted for.182
In more complex cases the governing principle is that the fiduciary must account for all of
the profit which he made in breach of fiduciary duty, but this accounting must not operate
so as to unjustly enrich the plaintiff beneficiaries. While the fiduciary's liability to account
is not based on the principle of unjust enrichment, the Court must be vigilant to ensure
that the remedy of an account does not become a vehicle for the unjust enrichment of the
plaintiff.183
Thus, which is not so common in respect of trustees, but would conceivably be so in cases
of other fiduciaries, where the profit is derived from a business, rather than a specific asset,
given the risks inherent in business activities and the amount of time, effort and skill

required to make a business successful, there is a basis to argue that the principal who has
the benefit of the fiduciary's duty, will not necessarily be awarded an account of the entire
profits of the business.184
A fiduciary who has acted in breach of fiduciary duty, and against whom an account of
profits is ordered, may nevertheless be awarded an allowance for skill and effort employed
in obtaining the profit which he has to disgorge,185 where it would be inequitable for the
beneficiaries to step in and take the profit without paying for the skill and labour which has
produced it.186 Again this is a principle that applies to fiduciaries generally, not only trustees, and practically will not usually be encountered in the context of professional trustees
who are generally unwilling or too commercially inexperienced to engage directly in the
underlying economic undertaking of which they are a trustee. This power is to be exercised sparingly. While the Court will be reluctant to confer a windfall on the beneficiaries
by depriving the trustee of its right to charge for its services, the obvious concern is not
to encourage fiduciaries to act in breach of fiduciary duty on the expectation they will be
rewarded for their efforts with an allowance.187 The Court is most likely to deprive a trustee
of their allowance where the trustee has acted surreptitiously, dishonestly or in bad faith.188
However, there are examples in the English case law where notwithstanding deceitful or
surreptitious conduct a fiduciary has been permitted their allowance.189
The fiduciary has the burden persuading the Court that its entire profits are appropriate in
the circumstances. It is not a relevant consideration for the trustee to argue that the beneficiaries would have consented to the profit, had they been informed and consented. While
such considerations can be relevant to the question whether the trust has suffered a loss as
a result of the breach of fiduciary duty, they are not relevant in determining what profit has
been made by the trustee in breach of fiduciary duty.190 It is the actual profit the trustee has
obtained for which it must account, rather than any profit in excess of some hypothetical
level to which the beneficiaries might potentially have agreed had they been asked.
A trustee may not avoid the obligation to account for a profit made in breach of fiduciary duty by arranging for the profit to be earned by or accrue to a third party, such as a
separate corporate entity.191 The Court will not permit the interposition of a corporate
entity to protect a profit obtained in breach of fiduciary duty from being stripped away
where the company's separate legal personality has been used to conceal the fact that
the fiduciary has made the profit,192 such as where the company is the alter ego of the

fiduciary.193 According to the UK Supreme Court, if no other remedy is available, it may be
possible to pierce the corporate veil, if the company's personality has been used to evade
the fiduciary's liability.194 However, no piercing may take place on the basis merely that the
fiduciary has a substantial interest in a company.195 The Royal Court has a discretionary
jurisdiction to award compound interest in respect of any award to account for profit, gain
or advantage derived from a breach of trust or fiduciary duty.196

B. Proprietary Remedies
Whether a bribe or secret commission received by a fiduciary in breach of its fiduciary
duty can be subject to a proprietary claim (as well as a personal obligation to account) in
favour of the beneficiary has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years.197
While there was no doubt that a fiduciary must account for any secret commission or profit
obtained by virtue of his position, there was a line of English authority that beneficiaries
could not claim any proprietary interest in monies constituting or representing a bribe.198
The issue becomes of practical importance, often in cases of fraud, where the defaulting
fiduciary becomes insolvent prior to the fiduciary's default being remedied. While a proprietary claim in favour of the beneficiaries or principal will usually survive an insolvency
event, the fiduciary's personal accountability will not. Neither does a personal claim for an
account of profits rank in priority to other claims by the fiduciary's unsecured creditors.
First in Jersey199 and subsequently the UK Supreme Court200 have now settled this controversy: where a fiduciary, including but not limited to trustees, eg agents or company directors, receive a bribe or secret commission without authority, the fiduciary is to be treated as
having acquired the benefit on behalf of his principal, so that it is beneficially owned by the
principal. In such cases, the principal has a proprietary remedy in addition to his personal
remedy against the agent, and the principal can elect between the two remedies.201 The
approach in Reid which is the approach which currently prevails in Jersey effectively permits the plaintiff to elect either for a right in the nature of a lien on the profit to secure the
fiduciary's personal obligation to account, or a proprietary constructive trust over the secret
commission itself. A constructive trust of this sort arises automatically out of the fiduciary's
obligation to transfer the secret commission in specie. It follows that the beneficiaries are

entitled to trace the bribe or secret commission in order to identify its current form and
location before claiming a constructive trust over it or any asset substituted for it.202
While any profit may be subject to a proprietary interest in favour of the beneficiaries, the
fiduciary is nonetheless entitled to claim an allowance for expenses incurred in obtaining
the property.203 A fiduciary may also claim an allowance in respect of any effort or skill
employed in generating the profit. The Court will be mindful of the potential adverse consequences of encouraging fiduciaries to place their own interests ahead of those of their
beneficiaries with the expectation of being rewarded by way of an allowance for doing so.
The Royal Court has expressed itself as being reluctant to bestow a windfall on the beneficiaries by way of the 'free' administration of trust assets by stripping trustees of their
right to charge for the services they provide.204 In Carafe, the trustee was stripped of any
profit element of their professional fees, which may be adequate to discourage trustees from
actively taking steps to breach their duties in the expectation of reward.
The beneficiaries may issue proceedings seeking declaratory relief as to the ownership of
the asset representing the profit that is caught by the no-profit rule combined with suitable
orders concerning the vesting of the property. Where the proceeds of the profit have been
dissipated so as to be untraceable, the trustee remains personally liable to account to the
beneficiaries for the value of the profit obtained in the same way as the trustee would be
liable for any actionable loss sustained by the trust fund.205 The trustee is also obliged to
account for any income or profits derived from the profit that is subject to the constructive
trust that arises by virtue of the rule. A trustee who expends its own money in the upkeep
of any property that represents a profit is entitled to reimbursement for those costs and
expenses from the fund by way of its indemnity by reason of the principle that the trustee
is not obliged to expend its own money in the maintenance of the trust assets.206 The Court
is reluctant to permit the beneficiaries to obtain a windfall in what would in effect, were
the trustee's right of indemnity to be barred, amount to the free administration of trust
property. It will be observed that the operation of the rule is not a one-way street for the
beneficiaries. The property that has been acquired by the trustee in breach of the rule may
be burdensomely expensive and to treat it as an accretion to the trust fund may not be in
the interests of the beneficiaries as a whole. Beneficiaries cannot be compelled to accept the
property as an accretion to the fund.207 For this reason, the rule is described as 'a sword for
the beneficiaries which may be sheathed if desired, not a shield for the trustee.208

Remedies

357

C. Compensation for Loss209
The beneficiaries may alternatively seek to claim equitable compensation in the nature of
damages for any loss caused to the trust fund by a breach of fiduciary duty.210 In support
of a remedy for loss, the House of Lords has held that the fact that rescission was impossible did not preclude the possibility of a pecuniary award,211 and recognised that equitable
compensation could be awarded if the breach of fiduciary duty had caused loss.212 It might
be argued213 that equitable compensation in the nature of damages is not a remedy for
breach of fiduciary duty by a trustee on the basis that the primary remedy of a beneficiary
is an order for an account to be taken and if a trustee has committed a breach of fiduciary
duty, by way of the surcharging or falsification of the entries in the account, the trustee is
liable to make the position whole, as if no breach of fiduciary duty has occurred.214 While
an account is the usual remedy against a trustee, not all fiduciaries are necessarily stewards
of property from which an account can be taken. Where there is no fund, compensatory
relief must be available as a necessity to ensure that any loss caused by a breach of fiduciary
duty is not without a remedy.
However, compensation is only available in respect of loss which is shown to have been
caused by a breach of fiduciary duty,215 which requires the Court to determine what would
have happened but for the breach of fiduciary duty. It will amount to breach of the principle against double recovery to pursue a claim for compensation for loss and an account
of profits.216 Consideration may be given to how the beneficiaries or principal would have
acted if the fiduciary had not acted in breach of fiduciary duty.217 The fiduciary will have a
defence to a claim for compensation where the beneficiaries or principal would have acted
in the same way even if the trustee or fiduciary had disclosed all the material facts.218 In
Gwembe Valley Development Co Ltd v Koshy,219 the defendant director was found to have
acted dishonestly in not disclosing his interest in a transaction and was nonetheless held
not liable to pay equitable compensation on the basis that his breach had not been proven
to have caused loss to his company.
The burden of proving that the breach of fiduciary duty caused the loss for which compensation is claimed rests with the beneficiaries.220 The beneficiaries must establish that but
for the breach of duty the loss would not have occurred. The Court may be persuaded to

draw inferences (but will not speculate) as to what would have happened had the trustee
performed its duty properly. In the absence of evidence to justify such inferences the beneficiary of the trust is entitled to be placed in the position it was in before the breach occurred,
unless the fiduciary (on whom the onus will lie in proving this) is able to show what the
beneficiary would have done if there had been no breach of fiduciary duty and that in doing
that, no loss would have occurred.
Compensation cannot be recovered for breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty where the loss
suffered is merely reflective of loss caused to a company of which the plaintiff is a shareholder, even if separate duties are owed to the company and the plaintiff respectively.221
Careful analysis is required in cases involving fiduciary duties at both the trustee and corporate level as to precisely who the loss that has been occasioned by the breach of fiduciary
duty belongs to.
The principles by which the quantum of an award for compensation for breach of fiduciary
duty are determined are not necessarily the same as those which apply to the quantification
of damages in tort or for breach of contract. The fiduciary is unable to assert a defence of
contributory fault or negligence against the plaintiff beneficiaries in order to reduce the
award where his or her breach of fiduciary duty involved conscious disloyalty.222 It has
yet to be determined whether a defence of contributory fault is unavailable in all cases
involving breach of fiduciary duty or only those involving conscious disloyalty.223 Given
the underlying policy imperative for the trustee's fiduciary duties is to ensure a trustee is
not tempted to prefer any other interest to that of the beneficiaries it is inappropriate for a
trustee to seek to defend themselves by arguing contributory fault on the part of the beneficiaries where the fiduciary has succumbed to temptation and thereby caused loss to the
fund. The principal's conduct will still be relevant where it is a factor determining the loss
for which he can recover.
As with cases where the remedy sought is for an account of profits, the Court may award
interest (both simple or compound) on an award for loss caused to the fund. In determining what interest rate will be applicable the Court will investigate the counterfactual position of what would have been done had the breach not occurred including analysis of the
appropriate rate of return in respect of funds or assets that have gone missing.224

a conflict without the approval of the Court, the informed consent of beneficiaries or the
terms of the trust instrument, the transaction is voidable and not void.226 A trustee asserting that the beneficiaries' consent was obtained, and the transaction should be upheld, bears
the burden of proving that it made full disclosure of all material facts to the beneficiaries
and that the consent was informed and freely given.
The beneficiaries may also apply to rescind a transaction entered into by the trustee with a
third party to the trust where the trustee has received a profit in the nature of a secret commission or a bribe from the third party in the transaction provided that the third party was
aware that the recipient of the profit was a trustee.227 This rule applies to all fiduciaries and
is not confined to trustees. It is also established that the beneficiaries may elect to assert a
proprietary remedy over the secret profit,228 but the beneficiaries must elect between claiming the profit and rescission of the transaction giving rise to it. It is not a defence that the
payor of the secret commission to the trustee believed the fiduciary had given disclosure to
the beneficiaries if it did not.229
The beneficiaries are entitled to seek rescission if they neither knew of, nor consented to, the
payment made to the trustee in breach of its fiduciary duty.230 Where it comes to the beneficiaries' attention that the trustee had been paid a commission by the other party to the
transaction of which the trustee has given insufficient disclosure to enable the beneficiaries
to give their fully informed consent, the Court has a discretion as to whether to rescind
the transaction. The Royal Court has refused to order rescission in such a situation where
it considered that the agreement, notwithstanding the conflict, was fair and reasonable.231
It is not a bar to rescission of the transaction if the transaction that is vitiated by the conflict has been executed or where the property subject to it has changed in value.232 Rescission will usually be refused where the beneficiaries have affirmed the transaction with full
knowledge of the trustee's interest in it.233
Rescission is only possible where restitutio in integrum is possible.234 Both sides of the transaction must be undone and the parties restored to their original positions. A trustee who

Conflicts of Interest

buys trust property from itself is entitled to be paid back the purchase price and interest if
the beneficiaries apply to set aside the sale. Equally, a trustee that lends money at interest
from one trust of which it is the trustee to itself as trustee of another trust is, in principle,
entitled to repayment of the principal plus interest, subject to the Court's inherent power
to reduce any contractual provision for interest it regards as excessive.235 And a trustee who
spends money improving property concerned has a lien on the property for the costs of
improvement.236 Likewise, the trustee is personally liable to account for profits which it has
received while in possession of the property.237 The beneficiaries are, however, not required
to return to a third party any bribe or secret commission which the third party paid to the
trustee, even if the beneficiaries have asserted proprietary rights in respect of such a profit
in the hands of the trustee.
The requirement for restitutio in integrum means that rescission will generally be barred
where it is not possible for the transaction to be undone such as where the property that
is the subject of the transaction has passed into the hands of a third party and cannot
be recovered. However, where rescission is impossible the Court may be willing to order
rescission on terms which require a monetary payment that places the parties, as nearly
as money is able, in the position they would have occupied had the transaction been fully
rescinded.238

i. Rescission of Transactions Entered into by Directors of a Jersey Company
8-92

8-93

A director of a Jersey company who has, directly or indirectly, an interest in a transaction entered into or proposed to be entered into by the company or by a subsidiary of the
company which conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the company and of which
the director is aware, is required to disclose to the company the nature and extent of the
director's interest.239 Such disclosure is required to be placed in the minutes of the directors'
meeting at the first meeting of the directors at which the transaction is considered after the
director concerned becomes aware of the circumstances giving rise to his or her duty to
make it.
Where a director of a Jersey company fails to comply with the requirements to give disclosure in accordance with Article 75, a member of the company, or the company itself may
issue proceedings to rescind the transaction entered into by the company.240 However, the
Court shall not set aside a transaction unless it is satisfied both that the interests of third
parties who have acted in good faith thereunder would not thereby be unfairly prejudiced;
and that the transaction was not reasonable and fair in the interests of the company at the

time it was entered into.241 A transaction is not voidable, and a director is not accountable
for any profit made under a contract with the company in which the director has an interest where, notwithstanding a failure to comply with Article 75, the transaction is confirmed
by special resolution; and the nature and extent of the director's interest in the transaction
were disclosed in reasonable detail in the notice calling a meeting of the directors at which
the resolution is passed.242 The Royal Court has recently considered whether Article 75
could be used by an incoming court-appointed trustee shareholder of a Jersey company to
rescind a registered charge over Jersey immovable property held by the company granted
by the company at the direction of the former directors of the company to the former
corporate trustee. In Dick Stock v Pantrust International SA, the Court was in little doubt
that the former directors of the company, who were also directors of the former corporate
trustee (one of whom was also the beneficial owner of the former corporate trustee), were
in a position of conflict when, as directors of the company, they considered whether or not
to accept the lending facility offered by the former corporate trustee and to grant it a second
charge over the company's property.243 The Court held that the burden of satisfying the
Court that the conditions in Article 76(3) have been met falls on the party seeking to have
the transaction set aside.244 The authors have some reservations as to whether this can be
correct given that Article 76(3) is only engaged where the director has failed to do its duty
to give disclosure of the transaction so that the interests of the company are potentially at
risk and that it seems unjust to reverse the burden of proof to impose on the company from
whom information has been improperly withheld whether third parties are involved and
that the transaction (details of which it will not have been given) was not reasonable and
fair at the time it was entered into.

E. Forfeiture
It is well established that there are circumstances where a fiduciary, and in practice the rule
is encountered more with agents than with trustees, who acts in breach of fiduciary duty
may forfeit their entitlement to remuneration.245 Remuneration obtained by the fiduciary
from a third party without the principal's consent can be stripped from the fiduciary, using
an account of profits, as it is in the nature of a bribe or secret commission taken in breach
of fiduciary duty.246 The commission or remuneration is forfeited because it has not been
earned by the fiduciary in good faith.247 The underlying policy rationale for the rule was set
out by Jacob LJ in Imageview Management Ltd v Jack as being:248

Conflicts of Interest

we are here concerned not merely with damages such as those for a tort or breach of contract but
with what the remedy should be when the agent has betrayed the trust reposed in him-notions of
equity and conscience are brought into play. Necessarily such a betrayal may not come to light. If
all the agent has to pay if and when he is found out are damages the temptation to betray the trust
reposed in him is all the greater. So the trust rule is there as a real deterrent to betrayal.249

8-95

Where the principal is aware that the fiduciary is acting for another party in the same transaction, the principal cannot normally require the fiduciary to disgorge any fees which he
or she receives from that other party as there will be no betrayal and their consent will
generally be implied.250 If a fiduciary acts dishonestly he will forfeit his right to remuneration from the principal (as distinct from sums paid to the fiduciary by a third party).251 He
will also forfeit his right to fees if he takes a secret commission from a third party which is
directly related to performance of the duties in respect of which he is being paid,252 even if
the principal has benefited from the fiduciary's performance of those duties.253 However, a
fiduciary's fees may not be forfeit if the betrayal of trust has not been in respect of the entire
subject matter of the fiduciary relationship and where forfeiture would be disproportionate
and inequitable.254

Remedies against Wrongful
Recipients of Trust Property
I. Introduction
A person who directly or indirectly, for his own benefit, receives trust property transferred
in breach of trust, in circumstances where the interests of the trust's beneficiaries in the
property have not been destroyed by the recipient being a without notice purchaser for
value, without actual notice, without justification is, prima facie enriched by his receipt.
In Jersey law, such receipt has the potential to give rise to a number of possible remedies against the recipient. Proprietary claims, to recover the assets from the hands of the
recipient, are considered elsewhere.1 Jersey law, like English law, may be said to have gradually moved in the direction of a general restitutionary remedy based on the principles
of unjust enrichment2 (whereby the recipient is personally liable to pay compensation in
respect of his unjust receipt (subject to a change of position defence). The parameters of
unjust enrichment in Jersey remain inexact and the jurisdiction to award compensation
remains in the early stages of development. Jersey also recognises an array of other personal
causes of action that may be deployed against wrongful recipients of trust property.3 It is
with these causes of action (as well as an action for unjust enrichment, that this chapter is
concerned.

9-1

II. Recovering Trust Funds Paid Away by Mistake
Jersey law recognises there is a cause of action for money had and received against a wrongly
paid or overpaid beneficiary (or third party) if the payment was made by mistake.4 Locus
to bring such an action is vested in the trustee rather than the beneficiaries and there is
persuasive English authority that beneficiaries cannot bring an action directly (although

fault or culpability; see Federal Republic of Brazil v Durant International Corporation [2012 (2) JLR 356].

Remedies against Wrongful Recipients

they may prevail upon the trustee to bring an action or themselves bring a derivative claim
by standing in the trustee's shoes).5 If the overpayment is as the result of the trustee's negligence, the recipient is not able to plead that negligence as a defence to an action for money
had and received, though change of position on the part of the payee is a defence.6 There is
House of Lords authority that is likely to be persuasive in the absence of any well-developed
local authority that money is recoverable under either a mistake of fact or a mistake of law.7
This opens the door to an action for recovery of overpaid or wrongly paid money to a beneficiary by reason of a mistaken construction of the trust instrument, or on the mistaken
basis that the trust in their favour was valid, though it was in law void for some reason. An
error of law may (although there is no authority to that effect) extend to recovery of money
paid on the mistaken basis that the trustee had a valid power to make the payment though
in law it did not. There is no Jersey authority to the effect that that the only mistake capable
of founding an action for money had and received is one which led the person making payment to suppose that he had a legal liability to pay.8 If a payment is made on the foundation
of a mistaken belief in the validity of the power then in principle there is no reason why
recovery should be denied. Recovery will not usually be permitted if the trustee is aware
that there is a doubt as to its entitlement to make the payment, but nonetheless decides
to make it anyway, thereby assuming the risk that its construction of the trust instrument
or view of the law may turn out to be wrong.9 An action for money had and received is,
on a traditional analysis, limited to cases of payment of money and is not available where
there is a distribution of assets in specie.10 However as Jersey does not recognise a distinction between actions at law and actions in equity, and has a unified theory of proprietary
tracing, it may be possible to recover assets from indirect recipients if the recipient is not a
bona fides purchaser for value without notice.11 If a recipient has sufficient knowledge or
notice before disposing of or dealing with the trust property so as to make him liable as a
knowing recipient, the trustee may make him accountable.12 However, the trustee will have
limited recourse against an innocent volunteer recipient of trust property if the recipient
has parted with the trust property before acquiring the knowledge or notice requisite to
make him personally liable.

Actions of Knowing Receipt

365

Lord Selborne in Barnes v Addy,13 distinguishable between cases of assistance and cases
of receipt. A third party who assists in a breach of trust may be made personally liable as
a dishonest assistant whether or not he has received trust property and whether or not he
is acting for his own benefit if the test for dishonesty can be made out.14 The remedy for
claims in dishonest assistance is considered in Chapter 12.
Where dishonesty cannot be established the third party may have a concurrent personal liability as a knowing recipient if at least the first four requirements below are made out. If the
requirements below are established against a defendant, he is deemed to be liable as a constructive trustee of the property and the property still in his hands is liable to be recovered
against him by way of a proprietary claim, discussed elsewhere. A proprietary claim will be
good against even an insolvent defendant as the property in their hands is ring-fenced from
the defendant's personal property, the plaintiff having priority to it as against the insolvent
defendant's other creditors. Concurrent with any proprietary claim that may be available, a
defendant found liable in knowing receipt is also personally accountable as if a constructive
trustee of the property received. Such personal accountability subsists even if the defendant
has since parted with the property received. Where the first four requirements made out
below are satisfied and the recipient still retains the property, then the proprietary remedy
will usually eclipse the concurrent personal claim. However, if the defendant recipient has
not retained (either in whole or in part) the received funds, the personal claim comes to the
fore and may be used to satisfy any shortfall in recovery under the proprietary remedy. The
personal claim affords the plaintiff no priority as against the defendant recipient's other
creditors in the event of the defendant becoming insolvent.

A. Locus
Generally, those with standing to pursue a breach of trust claim will have standing to pursue a claim for knowing receipt.15 A trustee who itself made a transfer of trust property in
breach of trust has locus to bring a knowing receipt claim as against the third party recipient, notwithstanding that as between himself and the beneficiary there may be a breach of
trust claim.

Remedies against Wrongful Recipients

If a claim in knowing receipt is made out, the defendant's liability is to make good to the
trust whose property has been transferred in breach of trust the money, or the value of the
property, which has been received by the defendant, with interest. The liability to pay interest will run from the date of the receipt, and the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to award
compound interest.17

i. Property that Is Subject to a Trust
9-8

It is a prerequisite, in order to make out a claim for knowing receipt, that the property that
has been knowingly received was subject to a trust or other fiduciary relationship. Property
subject to an express trust obviously satisfies this requirement but what the law regards as
a trust for the purposes of knowing receipt has been interpreted widely.18 Property comprised within a deceased's estate has been held in England to be subject to a trust for these
purposes.19
a. Companies and Fiduciary Agents and Directors

9-9

The property of a company that is subject to or held or controlled by the fiduciary duties of
the company's directors or others on the company's behalf is to be treated as trust property
for these purposes.20 A bribe or secret commission paid to a fiduciary agent of a company,
such as a director, is imbued with a constructive trust in favour of the company and is
property beneficially owned by it21 and, in the authors' view, is therefore capable of being
the subject of a claim in knowing receipt by the company. In cases involving companies, it
is the company (or its liquidator) and not the shareholders (absent a derivative claim) that
have locus to bring an action for knowing receipt in respect of a breach of fiduciary duty by
a director concerning the company's property.

Actions of Knowing Receipt

b. Property Subject to a Resulting or Constructive Trust
There are two kinds of constructive trust imposed by operation of law.22 The first
(a 'type one' constructive trust) is a trust imposed on property in circumstance where there
was a fiduciary relationship preceding the breach, such as in the case of an express trustee
or a director of a company. The second (a 'type two' constructive trust) is a trust imposed
where there is no preceding fiduciary relationship and the trust is constituted for the first
time by the wrongful conduct of the defendant in asserting his interests to such as to render
it unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit of what he had received leading to
the imposition of an equitable obligation him.23 As is well understood, such a person is not
in fact a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to account as if he were. In such a case,
the expressions 'constructive trust' and 'constructive trustee' are said to be 'nothing more
than a formula for equitable relief '.24 Save in the case of a Halley trust,25 a constructive trust
(of either type) will not arise out of a contract which has been procured by a fraudulent
misrepresentation unless and until the contract has been rescinded.26 The Royal Court has
acknowledged that property subject to a Quistclose trust27 is capable of founding an action
for dishonest assistance and we can see no basis why similar reasoning could not be applied
in a case of knowing receipt.28 Where the transfer of property is made by a trustee under a
transaction that is voidable on the basis of fraud (by the recipient) or mistake on the part
of the trustee and the trustee elects to rescind the transaction (but not otherwise) then the
property transferred is held on constructive trust for the trustee. It is the authors' view that
property may be the subject of a knowing receipt claim if it is wrongfully transferred subject to either a type one or a type two constructive trust. What matters is that property has
already becomes subject to a trust imposed by law before it is wrongly transferred to a third
party rather than to the rightful beneficial owner. It seems obvious to the author that property that is also subject to a resulting trust would satisfy this first requirement. A resulting
trust arising from the failure or determination of an express trust in favour of the settlor is
obviously still trust property. Likewise where property is purchased in the name of another
person and then transferred to a third party without the purchaser's authority.

9-10

ii. A Transfer of Trust Property
There must be a transfer or misapplication of either (usually) the legal title29 or the beneficial title (by way of an equitable assignment) to property subject to the trust or fiduciary relationship. Consideration should be given to the capacity of the transferor of trust

property to affect a transfer to a third party. Under Jersey law an express trustee has, subject
to the terms of the trust, all the powers of disposition of an absolute owner in relation to
property comprised within the trust.30 A transfer of the legal title will be effective, even
where the transfer is in breach of trust, although, by reason of the breach, the beneficial title
remains subject to the trust.31 Transfers of money that are made under a void transaction
will suffice.32 Most transactions purported to be executed by a Jersey corporation are not
void as being in excess of corporate capacity.33 A purported transfer of trust property by
a person who has neither legal nor beneficial title to the property will not suffice to fix the
recipient as a constructive trustee of the property. The recipient may have physical possession of the property but the action to recover the property is not one of knowing receipt but
an action for goods or money had and received.34

iii. The Transfer is in Breach of Trust
9-12

9-13

There must be a transfer of trust property in breach of trust although the breach does
not have to be fraudulent or dishonest.35 The transfer itself must be the breach of trust;
it is insufficient that there has been a breach of trust preceding the transfer. A transfer of
trust property in breach of trust of whatever character is usually ineffective to destroy the
beneficial interest in the trust property unless the transferee is a bona fides purchaser for
value without notice.36 The result is that while legal title may be transferred the rights of the
beneficiaries subsist in the property as against the new title holder.
It is impermissible as a matter of Jersey law for Jersey immovable property to be held directly
in trust.37 Consequently, there is no directly analogous provision in the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984 with section 2(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925.38 The closest equivalent provision
is Article 55 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, which provides that where property subject
to a trust is transferred to a bona fides purchaser for value without actual notice of the
breach of trust, the property transferred is wiped clean of the trust to which it was formally
subject (which now takes effect in the purchase money). Where the beneficial interests are
overreached in this way, it is not possible to bring a knowing receipt claim in relation to the
property transferred in breach of trust. However where there is no overreaching the recipient remains exposed to a knowing receipt claim if the knowledge requirement is satisfied.

Actions of Knowing Receipt

A breach of directors' duties will suffice to found an action of knowing receipt.39 It does not
seem relevant to this requirement, whether the company is a Jersey company or whether the
breach that is alleged is governed by a foreign law.
Where the constructive trust existing over the property is of 'type two', as discussed above,
to describe the transfer of property as being in 'breach of trust' sits awkwardly with the way
the constructive trust arises; as the existence of the constructive trust and the transfer may
occur simultaneously or so closely together in time as to be indistinguishable. The reality is
that the constructive trust arises when the constructive trustee fails in their duty to restore
the property to its true owner.

iv. The Property (or its Traceable Proceeds) is Received by the Defendant
In determining whether trust property has been received, it is permissible to use the principles applicable when seeking to assert a proprietary remedy by way of tracing.40 Jersey
law does not recognise the separate rules applicable in English law to following at law and
tracing in equity, which, in Jersey, are subsumed into a single flexible doctrine of tracing.41
It follows that it is possible to establish receipt for the purposes of a knowing receipt claim
even where the defendant has received the property indirectly (provided the knowledge
requirement is made out and the receipt is not from a bona fides purchaser without notice).
It would even seem possible to establish receipt by way of so-called 'backwards' or 'reverse'
tracing thereby circumventing difficulties with tracing the receipt of trust moneys through
overdrawn bank accounts and the lowest intermediate balance rule.42
Provided the requirements of knowledge is satisfied against each of them (and there is
no interposition of a bona fides purchaser for value without notice), a claim for knowing
receipt can be brought against each and every participant in a chain of recipients leading
from the original transferee of trust property to the last recipient into whose hands the
funds are traceable (though not as to achieve any double or multiple recovery).

a. Receipt by Agents and Nominees and Ministerial Receipt
Trust property received by an agent on behalf of the defendant amounts to receipt
by the defendant if there is no evidence that the agent has accounted to the defendant
for their receipt or dealt with the property at the defendant's instructions. A company's
shareholder(s) is not the company and so money received by a company is not, in the
absence of a successful application to pierce the corporate veil), to be regarded as receipt
by the company's shareholder.43 The law on piercing the corporate veil has been restated in
England in Petrodel Resources Ltd v Prest.44 In Prest, the older cases on piercing the corporate veil were reviewed and re-analysed to be cases where the company's receipt was as an
agent for the principal defendant who had used the company to conceal their true identity

as recipient and not to be cases that involved disregarding the distinct personality of the
company. Where a company (or several companies) is interposed so as to conceal the identity of the real actors, the Court will not be deterred from identifying those actors, where it
is relevant, without disregarding the corporate structure put in place. Where however the
interposition of a company or companies is designed to defeat a right or enforcement of
that right against a person who is in control of the company that exists independently of
the company, then the court way disregard the corporate structure. This evasion principle
will usually have limited relevance to cases of knowing assistance because there will usually
be no pre-existing right against the defendant other than the receipt and that right will only
arise if the company's receipt is treated as the defendant's receipt.
The principles applicable in a case of concealment however are potentially more
relevant in that it may give the court greater scope to regard what is ostensibly a receipt by
a company for its own benefit as actually being a receipt by the company as the defendant's
agent. Where the money is subsequently distributed by the company or sold on with notice
to the shareholder(s) then the requirement for receipt will clearly be satisfied as the distribution will be the traceable proceeds of the company's receipt.

v. The Receipt Is for the Defendant's own Benefit
9-20

A recipient must receive the property in his own right and for his own benefit.45 Where
property is received by the agent of a third party, in breach of trust, the agent is not liable
for knowingly receiving property in this ministerial capacity because he does not receive the
property for his own benefit.46 If the agent transmits the property to his principal he may
be liable as a dishonest assistant if he does so knowing the property that he has received
was in breach of trust and knowing that in transmitting the property to his principal, the
principal would treat it as his own. The authors are of the view that the same principle
applies to nominees. What is the liability of a bank that has received and dealt with the
proceeds of misapplied trust monies? Is the bank to be treated as having received the funds
for its own benefit or on the basis they have received it in a ministerial capacity? There is
thought to be a relevant distinction between the situation where money is deposited with
the bank by the account holder and the situation where the money is deposited with the
bank by a third party.47 Where the deposit is by the account holder, the bank receives the
funds beneficially. Money deposited with a bank by an account holder becomes the bank's
money as an accretion to the debt owed by the bank to the account holder.48 If the account
is overdrawn the deposit is treated as a repayment of the debt owed by the account holder
to the bank.49 Where cash is deposited with the bank by a person other than the account
holder, the bank is thought to take the accretion to the account in a ministerial capacity
as agent for the account holder and not for its own benefit, so as to preclude a claim in
knowing receipt against it. This distinction is thought to rest on two principles: first, that
a bank which receives a deposit from someone other than the account holder does so on

its customer's behalf. The bank does not receive the sum deposited beneficially because it
takes title to the funds. To take the sum deposited beneficially requires also that the bank
does not have to account for an equivalent sum to the principal who is himself liable to the
plaintiff when the defendant takes receipt. The second is how the treatment of the receipt of
third party funds into an account is booked by a bank. Regardless of the state of the account
between the bank and the account holder (whether in credit or overdrawn), the bank first
receives the deposit in a ministerial capacity as agent for the account holder. In a separate
transaction, the bank either borrows the money from its customer (crediting the sum in its
own books as a debt owed to the customer) or, if the account is overdrawn, the bank applies
the amount borrowed in reduction of the account holder's debt to the bank.50 The bank
is not enriched because upon receiving the deposit into the account from a third party the
bank becomes indebted to its customer for the corresponding amount.51 Against this line
of authority are a number of decisions and dicta, which include Millett J's further statement
in Agip that 'if the collecting bank uses the money to reduce or discharge the company's
overdraft … it receives the money for its own benefit'.52

vi. The Defendant's Receipt Is with the Knowledge that the Property Is Trust
Property and Has Been Transferred in Breach of Trust
The Royal Court has adopted the test of unconscionability as the relevant threshold in relation to knowledge for the purposes of knowing receipt;53 however, the test of unconscionability has been recognised to be something of an elephant test.54 In the absence of extensive
local authority, English cases and those from other jurisdictions that share the Privy Council as their final court of appeal, are likely to be regarded as persuasive in Jersey. However,
even having recourse to these authorities reveals that the requirement of knowledge and
precisely what must be proven against a defendant has, been one of the most controversial
aspects of knowing receipt.
A classification of knowledge that has remained influential (despite its abandonment by the
higher courts in England) is that found in Baden v Societe General pour Favoriser le Developpement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA55 in which Peter Gibson J, delineated
five types of knowledge:
actual knowledge;56
wilfully shutting one's eyes to the obvious (so-called Nelsonian blindness);57

wilfully and recklessly failing to make such enquiries as would a reasonable and honest
man;
knowledge of circumstance which would indicate the acts to an honest and reasonable
man; and
knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable man on
inquiry.

The Baden categories should not be regarded as comprehensive; neither is the delineation
between the different categories particularly clear.58 Baden categories 2 and 3 are usually
regarded as being very closely aligned with category 1, actual knowledge, and a defendant
who wilfully shuts his eyes or recklessly fails to make reasonable enquiries is not entitled
to rely on a want of actual knowledge.59 Categories 4 and 5 involve the application of an
objective test to establish knowledge.
The Baden classifications of knowledge ceased to have relevance to actions for dishonest
assistance following the decision of the Privy Council in Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan.60 The
English Court of Appeal has expressed grave doubts about their utility in relation to claims
for knowing receipt,61 holding that while proof of dishonesty (in the Brunei sense) would
be sufficient to satisfy the requirement for knowledge, it was not necessary, the key threshold being whether the defendant's 'state of knowledge [is] … such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt'. However, in the absence of a definitive
statement as to what degree of knowledge makes it unconscionable for a defendant to retain
receipt of trust property, in the authors' view the Baden categories continue to have utility
even if that is only to provide some structure by which it is possible to distinguish between
different kinds of knowledge.
With that health warning, what is such a defendant required to know and which of the
Baden categories of knowledge, if satisfied, would fix a defendant to a knowing receipt
claim with liability? A plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew of the breach of trust
or fiduciary duty which underlies and gives rise to the claim.62 A defendant need not be
subjectively aware or know that as a matter of law there has been a breach of trust or fiduciary duty in the transfer of trust property to him but it must be proven that he has sufficient knowledge of the factual circumstances which make the transfer a breach of trust.63
There are some authorities that refer to a want of probity by the defendant being sufficient
to found liability.64 'Want of probity' refers to such knowledge that sufficiently affects the

defendant's conscience to justify the imposition of personal accountability upon him and it
is not necessary to prove that the defendant was knowingly dishonest.65
Knowledge within Baden categories 1-3 will affect the defendant's conscience sufficiently.
Knowledge within Baden categories 4 and 5 is capable (but not in all cases) of being sufficient to fix the defendant with liability.66 It will be possible to rely upon Baden categories
4 and 5 only if in the particular context the inquiries in question ought reasonably to have
been made.67 Baden categories 4 and 5 will suffice only if, on the facts actually know to
the defendant, a reasonable person with the attributes of the defendant would either have
appreciated that the transfer was probably in breach of trust or would have made inquiries or sought advice which would have revealed the probability of the breach of trust.68
If the facts already known to the defendant show that the transaction was probably
improper without further inquiries, the defendant will have constructive knowledge of that
impropriety without further inquiry. The defendant must make inquiries if there is a serious possibility of a third party having a proprietary right or, put in another way, if the facts
known to the defendant would give a reasonable person in the position of the defendant
serious cause to question the propriety of the transaction. The mere possibility that such a
proprietary interest or impropriety exists is not enough to warrant inquiries. There must be
something which the defendant actually knows (or would actually know if he had a reasonable appreciation of the meaning of the information in his hands) which calls for inquiry.69
While proof of guilt of commercially unacceptable conduct is not required for a claim in
knowing receipt, it will no doubt be relevant for the Court to have regard to the objective
norms of commercial conduct in coming to a view as to what a reasonable person would
have appreciated or inquired about.70
Where the defendant knows of circumstances that may be consistent with receipt of the
misapplication of trust funds but may also be consistent with propriety, the court is likely to
be mindful that a party to a commercial transaction should not be fixed with notice simply
by virtue of the fact that he is, loosely, put on inquiry.71 If even without inquiry or explanation the transaction appears to be a proper one, then there is no justification for requiring
a defendant to make inquiries. But if there are features of the transaction such that if left
unexplained they are indicative of wrongdoing, then an explanation must be sought before
it can be assumed that there is none.72

C. Knowledge and Notice
9-28

Is knowledge in the context of knowing receipt to be equated with the concept of notice
so that notice of property being subject to a trust and of a transfer of property in breach
of trust, whether actual or constructive, will suffice to fix a defendant with knowledge?
In the authors' view, notice is not the correct criterion for knowing receipt claims unless
the knowledge on which the notice is based is such as to make the defendant's retention
of the receipt unconscionable. The only reference to the doctrine of notice in the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 is in Article 55 which provides that a person dealing with a trustee will
only be prevented from raising a defence as a bona fides purchaser from the trustee if it has
actual notice (a conscious awareness of a breach of trust or fiduciary duty). In the authors'
view, there is no material difference between actual notice and Baden category 1 actual
­knowledge. Any lesser degree of notice, such as constructive notice, ie that a third party
dealing with a trustee ought to be aware of a breach of trust or would have discovered one
by making reasonable inquiries, or imputed notice, ie where a third party dealing with
a trustee through an agent is deemed to know everything of which his agent has actual
or constructive notice, will still afford the third party with a defence. Whether a person
claims to be a bona fides purchaser of assets without notice of a prior interest in them, or
disputes a claim to make him accountable as a constructive trustee on the footing of knowing receipt, the question of what constitutes notice or knowledge is, in reality, the same:73
where a defendant has actual knowledge of facts such that a reasonable person should either
have appreciated that a proprietary right probably existed or should have made enquiries
or sought advice which would have revealed the probable existence of such a right. Lord
Neuberger in Sinclair v Versailles74 put it another way-the bank will have constructive
notice where it should either have appreciated that a proprietary claim probably existed or
have made inquiries or sought advice, which would have revealed the probable existence of
such a claim.

i. Imputing Knowledge from an Agent to a Principal
9-29

An agent's knowledge can only be imputed to the agent's principal if the principal has a
duty of investigation in relation to the fact or matter that comes into the agent's knowledge
and the principal has engaged the agent either to discharge the principal's duty to investigate or if the agent has authority to receive communications from which the agent derives
the relevant knowledge.75

ii. The Knowledge of Companies

or alternatively on the basis of knowledge of an individual or group of individuals who are

the directing mind and will of the company in relation to the transaction in ­question.76
A director who arranges for his company to enter into a transaction may be the directing
mind and will be for the company in relation to the transaction even if he is not the directing mind and will for all purposes.77 A director can be the company's directing mind and
will be even if he acts in accordance with the directions of some stranger to the ­company.78
A company will continue to be effected by the knowledge of a person who is the company's
directing mind and will for the purposes of any subsequent stages of the same transaction.79
The unanimous decision of all the shareholders of a solvent company is to be regarded as
decision of company and the knowledge of a sole shareholder is to be regarded as the company's knowledge.80 Some doubt has been expressed as to what the position is where two or
more persons could properly be described as a company's directing mind and will in relation to a transaction where the knowledge that each of them holds individually, would, if
added together, constitute knowledge for the purposes of knowing receipt but which individually does not constitute the requisite knowledge.81 It has been held in Jersey that any
knowledge that those intimately associated with the ultimate ownership and control of the
defendant company had of the tainted nature of funds flowing into the companies could be
attributed to those companies.82
The unlawful or fraudulent conduct of an agent or a person who is the directing mind and
will of a company may affect the attribution to a company of their knowledge concerning a
particular transaction. The extent to which the attribution principles outlined above apply
depends upon the particular context in which the issue of attribution arises.83
Where a claim is brought against a company by a third party who has been defrauded by
agents acting for the company, it is not possible for the company to avoid the application
of the attribution rules. Were the company able to do so it would not be possible to establish liability in any case because the company can only interact with the world through its
agents. While the company could be described as the 'victim' of its agents who (by reason of
the attribution of their knowledge to it) have by their wrongdoing fixed the company with a
liability to the defrauded third party, the interests of the defrauded third party take priority
notwithstanding that the company may be described as a secondary victim of its agents.84
Where a company has been the victim of wrongdoing by its directors, or of which its directors had notice, then the wrongdoing, or knowledge, of the directors cannot be attributed

to the company so as to allow them to raise a defence to a claim brought against them by
the company or its liquidator in the name of the company and/or on behalf of its creditors,
for the loss suffered by the company as a result of the wrongdoing. That is so even where
the directors were the only directors and shareholders of the company, and even though the
wrongdoing or knowledge of the directors may be attributed to the company in many other
types of proceedings.85
Where the claim is brought by the company against its directors or agents the issue is
whether the attribution rules should apply so as to attribute the unlawful or fraudulent
conduct of the company's directors or agent or the person(s) who is the company's directing mind and will in relation to the transaction, to the company so as to afford the defendant to the company's action an opportunity to raise the defence of ex turpi causa non oritur
actio.86 The UK Supreme Court has been instructive in describing how the attribution rules
apply in those circumstances. Where the company is the victim of the wrongdoing that has
been undertaken by its agent or the person(s) who is the company's directing mind and will
in relation to the transaction, there will generally be no attribution to the company. This
is known as the 'Hampshire Land principle'.87 This principle also prevents the defence of
ex turpi causa non oritur action being raised against the company. There is an exception to
the Hampshire Land principle, which remains of uncertain ambit, in the case of a 'one man
company' where the fraudster or fraudsters whose conduct or knowledge is sought to be
attributed to the company is or are the 'sole actor' in the sense that the company is owned
and controlled by the fraudsters and there is no separate constituency of directors or shareholders who are innocent of his/their fraud.88 In such a case the company cannot seriously
be described as a victim thereby allowing attribution and the ex turpi causa defence.89 But
even in the case of such a 'sole actor', the Hampshire Land principle remains applicable so as
to prevent the attribution of knowledge to the company and the raising of an ex turpi causa
defence where the claim is brought by the company against its delinquent agents or those
associated with their wrongdoing.90
Where the company's claim is against its directors or agents who are guilty of unlawful or
fraudulent conduct for breach of their duties to the company or the company's claim is
against third parties, liable by reason of being accessories to that breach of fiduciary duty,
there will be no attribution to the company.91 It is thought that even where the Hampshire
Land principle is excluded, the principle that the company may claim against the directors or against third party accessories is not prevented from applying on the basis that the

Actions of Knowing Receipt

c­ ompany is merely a vehicle for fraud where the company has become insolvent because
in those circumstances the duties of the miscreant directors include a duty to consider or
act in the interests of creditors.92 Where the company is a vehicle for fraud, the company
will almost inevitably immediately become insolvent as soon as it is utilised for this purpose ensuring that the company may still claim against its directors because the duty of
the directors to consider and act in the interests of creditors arises from the outset. However, attribution may still be allowed (and hence the possibility of raising an ex turpi causa
defence) where the company remains solvent as no creditors are prejudiced and the defendant is also a participant in the wrongdoing or is sought to be made secondarily liable in
respect of the company's agents breach of fiduciary duty. In those circumstances there are
no relevant duties owed to anyone other than those engaged in fraud and hence no sound
basis upon which the ex turpi causa defence should be excluded.93 The company is properly
not to be regarded as the victim, but as the perpetrator of the fraud.94 This is the exception
to the Hampshire Land principle identified in the Stone v Rolls and Madoff decisions and
affirmed by the UK Supreme Court in Bilta. In this scenario, it will not be possible to establish that the company is a secondary victim in having been exposed to a third party claim.95
The application of these principles to an action for knowing receipt will usually result in the
knowing recipient of company assets transferred in breach of fiduciary duties being unable
to raise an ex turpi causa defence because the plaintiff company will usually be the victim in
having its assets paid away in breach of fiduciary duty. Further the principle that prevents a
guilty fiduciary from raising that defence against the company will also prevent those fixed
with secondary liability through a guilty fiduciary from raising it either.96 However, where
a solvent company which is a vehicle for fraud seeks to recover from a third party knowing recipient for the benefit of the fraudsters who need to rely upon their own wrongdoing against the plaintiff company to establish requirement 3 above, then the ex turpi causa
defence remains available to the knowing recipient.

iii. Proof of Knowledge
Knowledge may be proven affirmatively or by inference from the circumstances. The burden of proof of knowledge falls to the plaintiff on the balance of probabilities. Inference of
knowledge from the surrounding factual matrix is of particular importance in cases where
the knowing recipient elects not to call evidence.97 The court may also be concerned with
inferences in cases where it is necessary to reach a conclusion on the plaintiff 's prospects
of success on establishing the defendant's knowledge prior to trial such as in a strike out,

92 Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, Arts 44 and 45 (wrongful and fraudulent trading respectively). See
also In The Matter of the Z Trusts [2015] JRC 196C for the principles applicable to trustees of insolvent trusts, said
to be analogous to the company law position.

summary judgment or Mareva injunction. The following principles have been cited with
approval in relation to permissible inferences:
1.

In certain circumstances a court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the
absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give
on an issue in an action.
If a court is willing to draw such inferences, they may go to strengthen the evidence
adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by
the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness.
There must, however, have been some evidence, however weak, adduced by the former
on the matter in question before the Court is entitled to draw the desired inference; in
other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue.
If the reason for the witness' silence satisfies the Court then no such adverse inference
may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is some credible explanation given, even if it
is not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his/her absence or silence
may be reduced or nullified.
It will not be necessary for a plaintiff to invoke the principles propounded in
Wisniewski where the case is not dependent solely or even largely on silence but is built
on substantial documentary evidence.

9-39

A plea of privilege against self-incrimination is required to be taken in person by the witness in the face of the Court at the point when he was asked to answer specific questions
to which he objected.98 Proof of the defendant's knowledge should not be confused with
proof of the defendant's means of knowledge where he may have genuinely forgotten or
overlooked documents in his possession.99 If on a balance of probabilities the plaintiff is
able to prove the knowing recipient had actual knowledge, or had Baden Category 4 or 5
knowledge, the Court may infer actual knowledge even if the defendant might have been
able to show a credible explanation had he elected to call evidence.100
In circumstances where it is proven that a defendant has actual knowledge of facts such that
a reasonable person should either have appreciated that a proprietary right probably existed
or should have made enquiries or sought advice which would have revealed the probable
existence of such a right it is for the defendant to show that it lacked constructive notice of
the impropriety of the relevant arrangements.101

iv. Pleading Knowledge
9-40

An allegation of knowledge, especially if such knowledge is alleged to sufficiently affect
his conscience to justify the imposition of a constructive trust upon him,102 must be
fully particularised in the Order of Justice.103 If the claim is pleaded using the alternative

formulation of 'knew or ought to have known' facts or matters then the allegation on each
alternative must be supported by particulars differentiating between what the defendant
knew and ought to have known.104 In the authors' view, a pleading that only includes an allegation of what the defendant ought to have known is vulnerable to being struck out on the
current formulation of the law as adopted in Jersey. The Order of Justice should state what
the defendant actually knew and set out the facts upon which the plaintiff relies that show,
in view of that knowledge, the defendant's retention of the receipt was unconscionable.

v. With such Knowledge, the Defendant Retains or Deals with the Property
Inconsistently with the Trust
As in English law, the Jersey threshold by which liability is established is that first established
in English law in Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele
namely that 'the recipient's state of knowledge should be such as to make it unconscionable
for him to retain the benefit of the receipt'.105

9-41

vi. The Defendant Is Not a Bona Fides Purchaser of the Property for Value
without Notice
Equity's darling has an absolute defence to a claim for knowing receipt, just as such a recipient of trust property would be able to defeat a proprietary or tracing claim. It is to be noted
that in Jersey law what is required is actual notice rather than some lesser kind of constructive notice although the issue is likely to be self-referential in that a defendant against whom
the requisite knowledge can be established is likely to have actual notice so as to preclude
the defence applying.106

IV. Trustees de son Tort
A trustee de son tort is a person who, by mistake or otherwise, assumes to act as a trustee without being properly appointed to office.107 They are a de facto trustee.108 A trustee
de son tort is accountable to the beneficiaries of the trust as if he were an express trustee for any trust property received by them109 and falls within the definition of a trustee
for the purposes Article 2 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.110 Most of the Jersey reported

Remedies against Wrongful Recipients

cases ­concerning trustees de son tort arise from the defective appointment of an express
­trustee111 although the principles are equally applicable to a situation where an outsider
to the trust intermeddles in the affairs of the trust without the authority of the de jure
trustee.112 It follows that an agent or delegate acting with the authority of a duly appointed
trustee is not committing any 'wrong' by acting within the scope of his delegation and is
not 'intermeddling' in the trust so as to constitute him a trustee de son tort.113 If an agent
of a trustee de son tort proceeds to administer the trust without reference to the trustee, as
though he himself were a trustee rather than as an agent, then the agent will go outside their
authority and will themselves become a trustee de son tort. If a trustee wrongfully abandons
the administration of the trust to an agent, who in consequence becomes a trustee de son
tort and there is a resulting loss to the fund, the trustee and the agent will be jointly and
severally liable. A trustee de son tort is a 'type one' constructive trustee,114 the overarching
principle being that a person who assumes office ought not to be in a better or worse position than if he actually were what he purports to be.115
A person must consciously know that they are taking the office as trustee to be a trustee de
son tort. It is not a requirement for a person to be fixed with liability as a trustee de son tort
that they have done anything wrong.116 Many of the Jersey cases concern instances where a
trustee de son tort assumes to act as trustee with the best of motives and may be unaware
(without negligence on their part) that they have not been duly appointed to execute the
office of trustee.117

A. Liability of a Trustee de son Tort
9-45

When the Court considers whether the trustee de son tort has acted in accordance with
its duties, it is not open to the trustee de son tort to use their defective appointment as
a defence.118 The liability of a trustee de son tort is limited to the property which it has
received.119 Receipt has been held to mean the acquisition of title to or the right to obtain
title to the assets and is not to be elided with lesser forms of control over the assets.120 The
lack of a Jersey equivalent to section 40 of the Trustee Act 1925 (whereby certain trust
properly automatically vests in a new trustee) sidesteps the apparent uncertainty in English
law121 concerning the liability of a trustee de son tort who administers and controls trust
property that, because of the defective appointment, does not automatically vest in them
as trustee.

B. Validity of Acts Done by a Trustee de son Tort
Where a trust is administered by a trustee de son tort, particularly if a long time has passed
since their defective appointment as trustee and the realisation that the appointment was
or may have been defective, questions are likely to arise as to whether the acts of the trustee
de son tort have been valid and what the consequences of that may be for the fund and the
trustee.122 Even if the liability attaching to the trustee de son tort or the apparently retired
trustee as a result of the purported exercise of powers is expunged by application of, for
example, Article 45 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law, the validity of the exercise may nonetheless
be impugned.
The consequences of an ineffectual appointment can potentially be very serious for the
trust and the trustees (whether de facto or de jure). The exercise of a power or discretion by
a trustee de son tort may come under attack because retiring trustees were not effectively
discharged from office having regard to the defective character of the appointment but
nonetheless did not participate in the exercise of the power or discretion (and so remain
liable for the administration of the trust from which in their minds they have resigned
responsibility). The exercise may be attacked on the alternative basis that the power or
discretion purportedly exercised by the trustee de son tort was not available to him because
it had not been properly appointed. There is very little authority, either in England or in
Jersey, as to the validity of the exercise of powers by a trustee de son tort. Had the validity
of acts done by a trustee de son tort not been in doubt, it is difficult to understand why the
Royal Court in In re BB, A & D123 thought it might be necessary to 'unscramble' what had
been done by trustees de son tort. In English law it is regarded as doubtful whether the definition of trustee in the Trustee Act 1925 (which encompasses a constructive trustee) is wide
enough to enable a trustee de son tort to validly exercise powers conferred upon a trustee by
that legislation.124 Likewise in In re BB A & D it was held that Article 2 of the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984 was wide enough to encompass a trustee de son tort.125 It was not the subject of
argument whether that enabled a trustee de son tort to exercise the powers in Articles 24
and 25 of the Law although it was accepted that the power of the trustee de son tort to exercise powers in the trust deed of appointment of new trustees (consistent with Jasmine) was
in doubt. In the absence of specific provision in the trust instrument that includes within it
the definition of a constructive trustee as a 'trustee', it is the authors' view that the exercise
of any dispositive or administrative power by a trustee de son tort is invalid.126

C. Confirmation and Ratification of Acts of a Trustee de son Tort
The Royal Court has held itself to have an inherent jurisdiction to ratify the acts of a trustee
de son tort who has acted in good faith, unaware that it has not been duly appointed.127 Such
122 Described in In re BB A & D (n 107) as 'the havoc that would be caused by any attempt to unscramble what
was purportedly done by the trustee de son tort, and would have been properly done had there been no defect in
his appointment'.
123 ibid.
124 Jasmine Trustees Ltd v Wells & Hind (n 109) at 55.
125 However, this appears to have been with an eye to the agreed course of all parties to the case that the acts of
the trustee de son tort were to be ratified and confirmed pursuant to Art 51.

Remedies against Wrongful Recipients

a conclusion was apparently necessary to save the havoc that would no doubt be wrought
in attempting to unscramble the purported exercises of powers by a trustee de son tort.
However, that is not a wholly satisfactory answer to the issues.128 Not only was the exercise
of the Court's inherent jurisdiction wholly unsupported by authority, all the parties were
in agreement that they too wished to avoid the aforementioned havoc and for the Court,
so the point was not fully argued. The Court was also of the view that because a trustee de
son tort fell within the definition of a trustee for the purposes of Article 51 it would be possible for the Court to give directions to the trustees (once properly appointed) to approve
the exercise of any confirmatory powers in the trust instrument or to direct them not to
investigate, unravel or seek to litigate the past actions of a trustee de son tort. The principles
applicable to confirmation and ratification of the acts of a trustee de son tort have recently
been aired in In the Matter of the Z Trust,129 which concerned the consequences for the
exercise of the powers of trustees whose appointment had been set aside under Jersey's
statutory equivalent of the rule in Re Hastings Bass. The trustees' appointments were set
aside and the Court took the opportunity to clarify the scope of its apparent jurisdiction
identified in In re BB A & D to ratify or confirm actions taken by a trustee de son tort. The
Court identified three forms of ratification which it said may have the same practical result
but are conceptually distinct:
1.

2.

3.

Confirmation by perfection of an imperfect act or transaction; confirmation by a principal of a contract entered into by an agent without authority; confirmation by a company of acts done by directors which are voidable by reason of an undisclosed interest;
and confirmation by a donor of a gift made as a result of undue influence. In these cases
a transaction which is capable of being set aside or otherwise impugned itself becomes
fully valid and enforceable.
Confirmation by replacement of a tainted or doubtful act or transaction by an effective
one with a similar effect. Where a power is conferred on the trustees of a settlement to
appoint or apply capital or income of a trust fund for the benefit of any one or more
of a class of beneficiaries, and following a purported appointment by trustees, whose
appointment is in doubt, of part of the trust fund to a beneficiary absolutely, the validly
appointed trustees exercise their powers so as to appoint the same part of the trust fund
to the beneficiary absolutely and to resolve to apply all income of that part since the
date of the purported appointment to the beneficiary. In this type of case, the state of
affairs which was intended to have been brought about by the tainted or doubtful act
or transaction is instead brought about by a second act or transaction which is fully
effective.
Confirmation by non-intervention in acts or omissions which were not or may not
have been authorised but have nevertheless actually been acted upon, so that these
acts or omissions remain undisturbed and the trusts are accordingly administered on
the same footing as if those acts or omissions had been done or omitted by or with the

129 In the Matter of the Z Trust (n 107).

Trustees de son Tort

383

authority of duly constituted trustees. An example is where trustees de son tort who
have control over the trust assets, and mistakenly believe that they are the duly constituted trustees, operate a discretionary income trust so as to make distributions of trust
income among a class of beneficiaries in a manner which would have been entirely
proper had the trustees been duly appointed and those distributions are subsequently
left undisturbed on the same footing as though they had been validly made.
The Court has drawn a distinction between the validation of purported exercises of administrative and dispositive powers. The purported exercise of the latter by a trustee de son
tort, if validated, may have the effect of the Court changing the terms of the trusts on which
the property is held. The Royal Court has no general jurisdiction, other than Article 47 or
in the context of a compromise between adult beneficiaries, to validate the invalid exercise
of dispositive of powers by trustees.130 Outside of these exceptions, the only established
case where a court may intervene to validate a defective exercise of the power is where
the donee of the power intends to exercise a power in favour of an object of the power but
the exercise of the power fails to comply with some formal requirement of the exercise of the
power.131 That is not to say nothing can be done to confirm the invalid exercise of dispositive powers. The second form of confirmation will usually be available and the third form
may also be available. The kind of case which causes difficulty is where the power which was
originally sought to be exercised has lapsed by the time that the defective appointment of
trustees is discovered, or can no longer be exercised in the manner originally intended, and
no distributions have been made to give effect to the invalid exercise of power. That was the
position in the Jasmine case,132 and perhaps in such a case the only way of resolving matters
is a variation of trust in accordance with Article 47(1) of the Trusts Law, or (as happened
in the Jasmine case) a claim against the professional advisors involved. By contrast, where
a trustee de son tort, acting in good faith in the belief that they are the duly constituted
trustees, purports to exercise administrative powers, or perform other administrative functions conferred on the duly constituted trustees, whether by law or by the terms of the trust
concerned, then, even if the exercise of the powers is invalid, the Court has jurisdiction to
validate those acts on the basis that the Court may intervene in the administration of a trust
so as to secure its competent administration. It is to be noted that while Article 51 makes
no reference to ratification of past exercise of the trustee's administrative powers, the inherent jurisdiction, as supplemented by Article 51, is not merely a supervisory jurisdiction. It
is also a jurisdiction, where necessary or appropriate, to intervene in the administration of
the trust.133 The appropriate method by which the Court intervenes, and the appropriate
form of order, will depend on the circumstances of the case. In many cases the intervention
or order will take the form of a direction to the trustees, but that is not the only kind of
intervention possible. The guiding principle is that the form of intervention or order is such
as best serves the welfare of the beneficiaries and the competent administration of the trust
in the circumstances of the case.

D. Relief from Liability
9-50

A trustee de son tort falls within the scope of Article 45 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984,
which will be of assistance where it acts on a defective appointment, reasonably and honestly
believing to have been validly appointed.134 A trustee de son tort who acts in accordance
with its duties is entitled to an indemnity for all costs and liabilities reasonably incurred.135
It has yet to be decided in Jersey law whether a trustee exemption or exoneration clause contained in a trust instrument is capable of being construed so as to cover a trustee de son tort.

V. Unjust Enrichment
9-51

9-52

Jersey law does recognise that where property in respect of which a beneficiary had an
equitable proprietary interest was received by an innocent volunteer, the beneficiary had a
personal claim in restitution against the recipient, where the beneficiary is unjustly deprived
of his property without consent, even where he had not been guilty of any 'fault' in receiving the property.136 The state of mind required for a claim in knowing receipt was not
required to found an action in unjust enrichment in Jersey. If the recipient of the property
is themselves guilty of a fault,137 the recipient is a constructive trustee for the beneficiary,
and the beneficiary's remedy in respect of the property is proprietary.138 In a claim based
upon unjust enrichment, however, the beneficiary could only succeed to the extent that
the recipient remained unjustly enriched with the underlying principle being that in no
circumstances should the innocent recipient be left worse off than if he had never received
the funds in the first place. A 'change of position' defence was therefore available to the
recipient.139 For a claim based upon receipt, whether one based on mistake, knowing receipt
or unjust enrichment, the proper law of the objection is governed by the place where the
enrichment occurs.140
The breadth of the circumstances in which a claim in unjust enrichment will arise in
Jersey law is not yet fully developed. However, the Court has expressed the view that the fact
that unjust enrichment may not have been contemplated in relation to particular disputes
before does not mean that the Court is unable to declare new limits on a cause of action

Unjust Enrichment

for unjust enrichment.141 In Jersey, owing to the impossibility of a concurrent equitable
interest in Jersey immovable property alongside the legal interest, unjust enrichment has
been used to fill the place occupied in English law by the common intention constructive
trust in cohabitation disputes.142 However, whether in the context of a domestic arrangement or in the context of combatting international fraud the Royal Court has cited the
availability of a claim in unjust enrichment as one of the bases to reject, for the time being
at least, the proposition that Jersey law admits of the possibility of a remedial constructive
trust that affords a plaintiff a proprietary remedy to the particular assets,143 in the way that
unjust enrichment and unconscionability have been used as touchstones for such relief in
Canada, Australia and New Zealand and the Isle of Man.144

beneficially entitled, compel a trustee to retire, without terminating the trust.1 The Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 has no equivalent to the English section 19 of the Trusts of Land and
Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 which provides an out-of-court mechanism by which
the beneficiaries may, in certain circumstances, force the trustee to retire without bringing
the trust to an end.2 It follows that if there is no provision in the trust instrument conferring
power on the beneficiaries or some other person3 to compel the retirement of the trustee,
and the trustee does not wish to resign voluntarily,4 the trustee cannot be removed, save by
order of the Royal Court under its inherent jurisdiction.5

II. Removal of Trustee under an Express Power in the
Trust Instrument
The trust instrument itself may contain an express power conferred on some person to
remove the trustee. It is clear that in Jersey law, without any provision to the contrary in
the trust instrument,6 an express power to remove and appoint trustees is a fiduciary power

were given.

and can only be exercised for the benefit of the beneficiaries and not for the benefit of the
person on whom the power is conferred.7 The power to remove a trustee is one of the powers capable of reservation by the settlor or grant to a third party, such as a protector, under
Article 9A of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.
The significance of the distinction between a limited and a fiduciary power (although
the latter is a sub-class of the former) is that the donee of a fiduciary power owes a duty to
the objects of the power to consider from time to time whether and how to exercise it and
the objects have various remedies open to them if the donee does not or cannot do so. A
necessary corollary of a power being fiduciary is that it cannot, subject to the trust instrument, be released by the donee. Whether such a donee of a power can be compelled to consider whether or not to exercise a power of removal remains unclear. In the authors' view
it is arguable that subject to the context in which the question arises, the person in whom
such a power is vested should consider from time to time whether the trustee continues to
discharge its office adequately or ought to be removed. Where a third party has the power
to remove a trustee, that person is not, in our view, constrained by the same considerations
that the court would have if an application for removal came before it under Article 51(2)
(a)(ii).8 In Re Skeats Settlement,9 it was held to be sufficient that the donee of the power
of removal had concluded, on the basis of relevant considerations that the trustee was no
longer the best that could be found for the beneficiaries as a whole. Whether there is friction between the trustee and one or more beneficiaries may arguably be a relevant consideration, particularly where the trust is discretionary and the settlor's wishes as to how the
discretion should be exercised have an important role.10 Where the trustee is unsure as to
whether a power to remove him has been exercised properly, he should seek the Court's
direction under Article 51 before he risks surrendering his control of the trust fund to a
newly appointed trustee.11
As an alternative to a power to remove a trustee, it is possible to expressly provide in the
trust instrument for the automatic removal of a trustee on the occurrence of specific circumstances. Aside from determining precisely when the designated factual circumstances
have come about,12 there may be a practical issue as to how trust property, vested in one
trustee becomes automatically vested in another.13 It is a common practice for trust assets
to be held in the name of nominees, so that where the nominees hold the trust assets for
the trustees for the time being, the replacement of one trustee for another has no effect on
the legal title. An issue may arise if nominees have executed a declaration of trust that they

to the donee of the power as well.

hold particular trust assets for named trustees. Where that named trustee is removed, the
outgoing trustee, the new and continuing trustees must ensure as part of the transitional
arrangements, that the nominees execute a declaration of trust that they hold on trust for
the new and continuing trustees. Automatic cessation of trusteeship carries with it the possibility that the trustee will be in the midst of an exercise of its powers when the specific
event occurs.

A. Ex officio Trustees
While rare among professionally administered Jersey trusts, a trust instrument may p
­ rovide
for the trustee(s) to be a person or class of persons who are holder(s) of one or more particular offices, that is to say an ex officio trustee. There is no doubt that in such cases an
individual's trusteeship ceases when he or she ceases to hold the office to which the trusteeship attaches. Where the office is unincorporated the trusteeship cannot attach to the office
itself, only its incumbent.14 Where the office is a corporation sole, any newly appointed
individual to the vacant corporation can assume office as trustee without further appointment. If a settlor specifies a successor trustee by name in the trust instrument as the holder
of a particular office for the time being, it does not appear obvious to the authors why
such trusteeship should not transfer automatically. That said, there is English authority
that suggests such provision is nothing more than an indication of the settlor's wishes as to
the identity of future trustees and is therefore not effective to pass the office of trusteeship
automatically.15 It appears that whether or not the trusteeship passes automatically it is the
right of the office holder to decline trusteeship.16

B. Removal of an Insolvent or Incapable Trustee
The Court may exercise powers of resignation conferred on a trustee who has become
­mentally incapable under the Mental Health (Jersey) Law 1969.17 For the vast majority of
Jersey trusts the trustee is a professional trust company and so mental incapacity is not an
issue although the jurisdiction may be used to retire an incapacitated director of a trust
company where no other mechanism in the company's articles of association exists. A trustee, including a corporate trustee, may not act as trustee during such time as his affairs
remain en désastre.18 If there is no other trustee capable of taking office at the time, the
Court must be invited by someone with locus, to make an appropriate order transferring
the trusteeship to a new trustee in order to protect the interests of the beneficiaries.19 The

vast majority of proceedings seeking the removal of the trustee are not made under this
jurisdiction but under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.

III. Removal of Trustee-Removal by the Court under its
Inherent Jurisdiction
10-7

Article 51(2)(a)(ii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 gives expression to the Royal Court's
inherent jurisdiction to remove a trustee, with or without the appointment of a replacement and without the trustee's cooperation.20 The power to remove a trustee cannot be
exercised by the Judicial Greffier or a judge sitting alone but only by the Inferior Number.21 The Royal Court's inherent jurisdiction to remove a trustee is not confined to trusts
that have Jersey law as their proper law.22 The Court has a similar supervisory jurisdiction
to remove a protector on similar grounds to those applicable when seeking to remove a
­trustee.23 The Court's power to remove a trustee is a discretionary one and in reality is
exercised relatively seldom because a professional trustee, as the vast majority of Jersey's
trustees are, will usually prefer to resign and avoid the risk of an adverse cost, than choose
to defend an application for its removal.24 A professional trustee often has more to lose
in terms of reputational damage than it has to gain in remaining as trustee facing hostile
and litigious beneficiaries.25 A trustee who unreasonably refuses to resign and has to be
removed by court order puts its indemnity for its costs of the proceedings at serious risk.26
A trustee that makes an appropriately timed offer to resign can go a considerable way to
defuse a dispute with beneficiaries, especially where a new, neutral trustee can be appointed
as a replacement. Such a solution also has the benefit of avoiding the not insignificant legal
costs of proceedings.27 Nevertheless, there are a variety of examples where a trustee has
sought to hang on to office rather than resign, for good28 and more questionable reasons.29

Removal under Inherent Jurisdiction

391

A. Locus to Seek Removal
Those with locus to apply to remove a trustee are those listed in Article 51(3) of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984, that is to say the Attorney General,30 the other trustees, an enforcer of
a non-charitable purpose trust, a beneficiary or, with leave of the court, any other person. While the locus of those able to make an application to have the trustee removed is
confined to Article 51(3) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law, the Court's jurisdiction to remove a
trustee is strictly a corollary of its role in ensuring that trusts are properly administered
and executed.31 It follows that the Court may at any time order a trustee to be removed and
the Court's power is not confined to the scope of the relief sought in proceedings brought
before it.32

10-8

B. Grounds on which a Trustee May be Removed
The Royal Court will not remove a trustee simply on the beneficiaries' say so and it is
­axiomatic to say it will not do so lightly.33 Removal is a serious step and the Court must
be satisfied there are proper grounds for removal. The following is a non-exhaustive list of
factual circumstances in which the Court can and has removed the trustee on the beneficiaries' application:
1.
2.
3.

6.

where the trustee has removed itself from the jurisdiction of the Royal Court and refuses
to answer correspondence from the beneficiaries or otherwise becomes untraceable;34
where the trustee has ceased to function;35
where friction between the trustee and his co-trustees or between the trustee and
the beneficiaries makes the trust unmanageable in the sense that the relationship has
entirely broken down;36
where the trustee shares contrary views to the objects of a purpose trust or charity;37
where the trustee has entered désastre, bankruptcy or otherwise makes a compromise
with its creditors;38
where the trustee shows want of honesty or reasonable fidelity;39

30 The Attorney General is a necessary (and in many cases the only) party able to make an application to remove
a charitable trustee from office. There are, however, no reported cases in which the AG has done so.

8. where the trustee has embarked on litigation calculated to promote the trustee's interest to the prejudice of the beneficiaries;41
9. where the trustee has otherwise misconducted himself42 such as self-dealing with the
trust property, by competing with the trust or by refusing to act in the interests of the
trust;43

promptly to the beneficiaries' interest or the preparation of trust accounts;44

authority;45
12. where the trustee has been guilty of a prolonged dereliction of duty in failing to provided adequate information and to make distributions, as required by the terms of the
trust;46
13. where the trustees are deadlocked so as to prejudice the administration of the trust
the court may remove (and replace) any number of trustees necessary to break the
deadlock;47

has failed to transfer trustee as ordered by its regulator.49

the respondent to an application for his own removal but are different factual examples in
which the principles discussed below have come to the fore.

interests depends upon the good faith and integrity of the trustee. The beneficiaries will
therefore be afforded all practical assistance by the Court to secure that interest against any
misconduct by the trustee, which includes an order for the trustee's removal.51 The beneficiaries' best interests are of course different from the wishes of a single beneficiary or a
faction of beneficiaries at any one particular time. Apart from the welfare of the beneficiaries the jurisdiction can also be exercised with a view to the security of the trust property,
the efficient and satisfactory execution of the trust and a faithful and sound exercise of the
powers conferred on the trustee52-although each of these may properly regarded as different facets of the same core principle, namely the Court's supervision of the welfare of the
beneficiaries. The leading case as to the principles to be applied on an application to remove
a trustee is not a Jersey case53 but a Privy Council decision from South Africa, Lettersted
v Broers,54 in which Lord Blackburn said as follows:
In exercising so delicate a jurisdiction as that of removing trustees their Lordships do not venture
to lay down any general rule beyond the very broad principle … that their main guide must be the
welfare of the beneficiaries. Probably it is not possible to lay down any more definite rule in a matter so essentially dependent on details often of great nicety…. It is quite true that friction or hostility between trustees and the immediate possessor of the trust estate is not of itself a reason for the
removal of trustees. But where the hostility is grounded on the mode in which the trust has been
administered… it is certainly not to be disregarded…. [I]f it appears clear that the continuance of
the trustee would be detrimental to the execution of the trusts even if for no other reason than that
human infirmity would prevent those beneficially interested or those who act for them from working in harmony with the trustee, and if there is no reason to the contrary from the intentions of
the framer of the trust to give this trustee a benefit or otherwise, the trustee is always advised by his
own counsel to resign, and does so. If, without any reasonable ground, he refused to do so, it seems
to their Lordships that the Court might think it proper to remove him.55

Subject to the general guiding principle that the act or omission on the part of the trustee
must be such as to endanger the trust property or to show a want of honesty, or a want of
proper capacity to execute the duties, or a want of reasonable fidelity, the test in its simplest
terms is: whether the continuance of the trustee or protector, would be detrimental to the
execution of the trusts.56

10-12

i. Removal on Grounds of a Breach of Trust
An actual or alleged breach of trust is likely to be a source of a loss of confidence in the
trustee or a source of friction and even hostility between the trustee and beneficiaries and
may create a conflict of interest in the trustee continuing in office. However, the Court
may remove a trustee owing to the breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and

the beneficiaries even without proof of a breach of trust.57 It may be helpful to regard the
­circumstances in which the Court will remove a trustee as points along a sliding scale. At
one extreme, where there is proof of positive misconduct or dishonesty by the trustee, serious incompetence58 or hopeless conflict,59 the Court will remove the trustee without hesitation.60 If a breach of trust is to be relied upon as sufficient grounds for removal, much will
depend on the gravity and nature of the alleged breach. Where it can be proven the trustee
has culpability in any breach of trust, the Court is more likely to consider removing them
from office.61 However, proof of deliberate default of duty by the trustee is not, it seems,
always required in order to engage the jurisdiction.62 Not every mistake, omission or breach
of duty by the trustee will merit the trustee's removal.63 Applications for removal have been
refused on the basis that the grounds for removal were insufficient where dissent has arisen
between the trustee and the beneficiary because a beneficiary puts forward an unsubstantiated claim that property of the trustee should be subject to the trust64 or the trustee has
defaulted in his duty on the grounds of misunderstanding as to the powers conferred by the
trust but without wilful default65 or a trustee who was guilty of a one-off failure to produce
a set of accounts when it was not clear such failure would reoccur in the future.66 The Court
may remove a trustee pre-emptively in anticipation of a breach of trust if it perceives the
trustee is likely to commit a breach without waiting for the breach to occur.67 The act or
omission must be such as to (1) endanger the trust property or (2) demonstrate a want of
honesty or fidelity or (3) demonstrate a want of capacity to execute the trustee's duties as
they should be executed, or a combination of one or more of these.68

ii. Friction and Hostility between the Trustee and Beneficiaries

Friction or hostility between trustees and beneficiaries, or between a trustee and his
co-trustees, is not of itself a reason for the Court to order removal.69 Were it to be otherwise every disagreement between the trustee, who is obliged to exercise an independent

judgement as part of his fiduciary duty, and the beneficiaries would end in endless
­applications to court. The Court has stated many times that the settlor's intention should be
respected and that it is the trustee's and not the Court's role to administer the trust according
to its terms.70 The Court is prepared to tolerate a degree of friction in the trust's administration as part and parcel of the trustee/beneficiary relationship. However, where the degree of
friction tips into hostility, such as to impact on the way in which the trust is administered,
where it is caused wholly or partially by overcharges against the trust,71 or where it is likely
to obstruct or hinder the due performance of the trustee's duties,72 the Court may come to
the conclusion that it is necessary, for the welfare of the beneficiaries, that a trustee should
be removed.73 Hostility arising from and manifesting itself in the administration of the
trust will be the touchstone upon which the Court will exercise its power to remove the
trustee. The key questions when advising a trustee are likely to include (1) How seriously
does the hostility affect the running of the trust? (2) Who is responsible for the friction?
(3) Is there a justification for the friction? Which beneficiaries are for and against the trustee's
removal? (4) Are there any particular reasons to refuse removal (or to refuse removal just yet)
and (5) Are the costs of appointing a new trustee disproportionate?74 The Court is in a better position to investigate hostility founded in the trust's administration than it is able to
investigate hostility founded, for example, in some other source, such as the breakdown of
family relationships, which are extraneous to the trust. Hostility grounded in the administration of the trust is also something for which the trustee can clearly be held responsible
and thereby provide justification for the trustee's removal.
An irretrievable breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and some of the beneficiaries was held not to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries as a whole and, at least
in part, this justified the trustee's removal in Parujan v Atlantic Western Trustees Limited.75
Further aggravating factors in that case included the trustee's conduct in charging excessive
fees, and that the trustee was also found to have committed a breach of trust in using the
trust fund to pay its own legal fees in hostile litigation with the beneficiaries.76 In a discretionary trust where no beneficiary has a vested interest in the trust property (and in trusts
where there is no beneficiary because the trust is for a charitable or non-charitable purpose)
the essential issue for the Court to consider is, having regard to the interests of all potential
beneficiaries as a class, whether the due and proper administration of the trust is put in
jeopardy by the trustee remaining in office.77 Where there is friction between the trustee
and a single discretionary object (or group of objects within a wider class) it is necessary
for the Court to determine whether or not the trustee is able to give a proper consideration to the beneficial object's claim in deciding whether or not to remove them.78 In Trilogy

Retirement, Removal or Replacement

Management Limited v YT Charitable Foundation (International) Limited & Ors,79 the Royal
Court ordered the removal of the trustee of a charitable trust owing to a deadlock in the
way the trust was structured which permitted a single individual to entrench herself and
exercise an effective veto over any proposal which went against her own views. This was
held to have a detrimental impact on the charitable trust's sound administration and unless
remedied would have led to an improper failure adequately to distribute profits and gains
to eight charitable sub-trusts, for charitable purposes. A breakdown in relations between
the trustee and the trustees of the sub-trusts was held to be a relevant factor in ordering
the removal of the trustee if it obstructs the carrying into effect of the charitable objects
of the trust.80 The Court commented that while the single-minded pursuit of what a trustee
believes to be the correct course of action is often regarded as a praiseworthy quality and
not a defect, in the Court's judgment a single director's defence of what she believed were
her father's (ie the settlor) wishes when first establishing the structure had crossed the line
from reasonable firmness to unreasonable obstinacy. Ultimately that unreasonable obstinacy led to the trustee's removal.

iii. Loss of Trust and Confidence
10-16

Inherent to the relationship between the beneficiaries and their trustee is the relationship
of trust and confidence. Where the beneficiaries lose trust and confidence in the trustee,
the Court may exercise its discretion to remove the trustee. Clearly, where there is hostility
based on a substantial mismanagement of the trust fund there is likely to be a diminution
in the level of trust and confidence in which the beneficiaries hold the trustee. However, the
Court will be mindful (1) that it should not accede to an application to remove the trustee
on the beneficiaries' say so and (2) that an alleged loss of trust and confidence can be manufactured precisely to provide grounds upon which to seek the trustee's removal. The Court
will look to whether the loss of trust and confidence is genuine, justified and warranted.
Where the loss of trust and confidence is genuine, justified and warranted, that alone may
in some cases be sufficient to justify removal.81 Some thought must be given as to in what
capacity the beneficiary is allegedly dissatisfied with the trustee given that the Court's jurisdiction exists to protect the welfare of the beneficiaries. In Isaac v Isaac (No 2)82 while the
applicants were discretionary beneficiaries it was not in their capacity as beneficiaries that
they were dissatisfied with the trustee. Their dissatisfaction arose from their belief that they
were not obtaining the advantages which they believed they would have got by personally
owning the substantial shareholding held by the trustee. Where the trustees are otherwise of
high standing and integrity but have nonetheless been held liable at first instance for a substantial but innocent breach of trust, and have lost the confidence of their beneficiaries, the
Court may decline to remove them from the trusteeship until an appeal against the finding
of breach of trust and other related proceedings have been determined, particularly when

a premature removal might prejudice the protection of the trustees against possible future
liabilities and the trustees give undertakings concerning the administration of the trust and
the proceedings of which they have the conduct.83
Where a trustee proposes to exercise a power that will have a momentous impact on the
future of the trust, in the belief that it accords with the settlor's intention, but the proposal
provokes a demand from the beneficiaries for the trustee to resign on grounds of loss of
confidence, in order to forestall the exercise of the power, what is the appropriate thing for
the trustee to do? Should the trustee resign as requested or refuse to resign and force an
application for its own removal. If it does the latter does the trustee put itself at personal
risk as to costs? In the Matter of the A Trust84 provides at least partial guidance on the
appropriate response from the trustee in such a situation. The case concerned a situation in
which beneficiaries alleged a loss of confidence in a trustee and demanded that they resign
in order to defeat a process by which the trustee proposed to exercise a power to expand the
beneficial class in accordance with what the trustee believed to be the settlor's intentions
for the future of the trust. In those circumstances the trustee was held to be right in applying to court for directions on the grounds that the efficient and satisfactory execution of
the trust required the issue as to whether the trustee should exercise the power to expand
the class to be clarified now and that blessing the decision would avoid difficulties for any
future trustee. Applications for removal have been refused in the converse situation, where
the trustee has refused, for honest motives, to exercise a power vested in him at the request
of a beneficiary.85

10-17

iv. Conflicts of Interest
A situation in which a trustee's personal interest and his duties conflict may justify the
trustee's removal on the basis that unless the trustee seeks the Court's direction as to what
it should do, it will either be disabled from dealing with the trust property or put itself in
breach of trust.86 In Dick Stock v Pantrust International SA & Ors,87 the trustee claimed to be
owed large sums of money from the settlor and beneficiaries for sums it has allegedly lent to
them on behalf of third parties to the trust over the years and had commenced proceedings
in Colorado against the beneficiaries on the basis of loan documents that appeared to show
itself as acting not qua trustee but qua creditor. The trustee had expressed itself as unwilling
to voluntarily retire as trustee, using the office of trustee to ensure its practical continuing
security over the trust assets in respect of the borrowing it claimed to be owed by the beneficiaries. This was a clear case of a conflict of interest between the trustee's stated desire
to seek recoupment on its loans and its obligations qua trustee to the beneficiaries.88 The
trustee may also find himself in a hopeless position of conflict where the trustee cannot discharge its duties equally as between the interests of two groups of beneficiaries of two trusts
which share the same trustee. Such a situation arose in In The Matter Of the E, L, O and R

Trusts89 out of the conduct of the affairs of a company, which was the sole asset of various
trusts held for the benefit of two groups of beneficiaries. In such a situation the appropriate
course for a trustee is to resign before it becomes necessary to remove it from office. It is not
necessarily the case that a trustee must resign on the grounds of conflict where beneficiaries
of the same trust take different views as to the administration of the trust. The nature of the
conflict necessitating the trustee's removal in E, L, O and R Trusts90 was a direct conflict of
interest between the beneficiaries (as well as clearly differing views) which had escalated to
the point of issuing proceedings for unfair prejudice under section 459 of the Companies
Act 1985 in relation to a company in which the trustee held the controlling shareholding.

v. Other Factors for the Court's Consideration as Part of the Court's Discretion
10-19

While the welfare of the beneficiaries is the Court's primary concern, the Court will also
have regard to all the circumstances, which it will place in the balance against the harm
to the beneficiary's interests in leaving the trustee in office. Those factors include the fact
that the trustee may have been specifically chosen and appointed by the settlor; the trustee's interest in maintaining its professional reputation; and the principle that the trustee
should be free from unwarranted interference from the Court. While a settlor's selection of
individuals to be his executors (and trustees) may be an important factor for the Court to
consider in deciding whether to remove them, ultimately it can never be determinative.91
Another factor may be that a trustee, who puts himself into a position where he becomes so
impecunious that he would be subject to a particularly strong temptation to misapply the
trust fund, may result in the Court ordering his remove from office in order to protect the
trust from that temptation.92 A trustee that is declared en désastre will usually be removed
from office,93 irrespective, it seems, of Article 54 of the Trust Law which is to the effect that
the trustee's creditors shall have no right or claim against the trust property except to the
extent that the trustee himself or herself has a claim against the trust or has a beneficial
interest in the trust and to that extent the trustee's insolvency in and of itself presents no
risk that the trust fund will be raided by the insolvent trustee's creditors.

D. Procedure for Removal and the Form of Proceedings
10-20

It is unusual for the removal of a trustee to be sought in isolation from any other form
of relief. As has been already mentioned, the Court has an inherent power to remove a
trustee from office regardless as to whether removal is pleaded in the prayer for relief.94
It follows that the form of pleading in which the relief is sought is largely irrelevant and the

A JFSC-regulated trust company business in financial difficulty will usually transfer trusteeship well in advance of
a declaration of désastre so as to make the invocation of the Court's jurisdiction to remove them otiose.
94 Indeed, where proceedings are commenced by way of Representation, it may be unclear at the commencement of proceedings, what the form of relief should be.
90

Removal under Inherent Jurisdiction

399

choice between commencing proceedings by way of Order of Justice or a Representation
will be guided by whether the removal of the trustee is accompanied by a claim for breach
of trust or other allegation of misconduct on the part of the trustee or whether its removal
is sought in isolation as the primary head of relief. Rather than the form of the proceedings,
it will be far more significant whether the basis for removal is adequately particularised.
A Representation, which is not bound by the strict rules of pleading, affords a plaintiff
beneficiary more latitude in setting out the contextual basis upon which removal is sought.
Where removal is sought in hostile proceedings alleging breach of trust or other duty, the
facts necessary to make out both the breach of trust and how the said breach engages the
principles discussed above must be clearly pleaded to avoid the claim being struck out.95
Careful thought should be given to the basis upon which removal is pleaded. If an allegation amounting to a discrete cause of action is later abandoned (even if the claim settles) it
may still amount to discontinuance with a cost penalty against the discontinuing party.96
Removal may also be sought as a remedy in proceedings commenced by way of Representation either singularly or as an alternative to some other form of relief.97 Matters giving
rise to a basis for removal may not be apparent at the outset of proceedings and may only
reveal themselves as the proceedings unfold. There is likely to be very little justification for
the hearing of an application to remove a trustee in the context of hostile proceedings being
heard in private and even where the names of other parties are excised and anonymised,
the trustee's identity is unlikely to be. The desire to avoid criticism in open court is a factor
that will weigh heavily with a professional trustee in deciding whether to jump before being
pushed. However, where the proceedings in which removal is sought are commenced by
Representation and involve the invocation of the Court's administrative jurisdiction, the
proceedings may be subject to an order for privacy for that reason.

i. Replacement by the Court
The jurisdiction under Article 51(2)(a)(ii) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 encompasses a
power to remove a trustee with or without a replacement. By law, a Jersey trust must have
a minimum of at least one trustee. The Court will not make an order removing a trustee
without a replacement unless an adequate quorum of trustees will remain after the order
for removal takes effect.98 It follows that an applicant will usually have to line up an alternative trustee in advance.99 In some circumstances the proposed new trustee may require the
Court's approval before it is formally appointed and may require or be ordered to seek the
Court's directions as to how it should proceed once appointed.100 Jersey has no equivalent

of the office of receiver and so the English practice of appointing a receiver of the trust
property in the rare cases where the need to remove the trustee is so urgent that no replacement has yet been found101 is not available. A trust will not be permitted to fail for want
of a trustee.102 Instead of a receiver the Court would most likely order the Viscount be
appointed to hold the trust property while a new trustee is found.103 The duration of the
Viscount's tenure as custodian of the trust property is likely to be very short. As an officer of
the Court, the Viscount will require to be put in funds before it will take any step in relation
to the trust property and will not take any such step without either a full indemnity from
the beneficiaries or by seeking the Court's direction. A trustee who is removed and replaced
will have to negotiate the terms of its release of any security for its liabilities before it can be
compelled to transfer any of the trust's assets to replacement trustees.104

E. Court-ordered Removal of Power Holders other than the Trustee:
Protectors and Enforcers
10-22

10-23

Thus far we have considered the Court's inherent jurisdiction to remove and/or replace a
trustee. It may well be the case that the continuation of the trustee in office is not the problem and the beneficiaries' interests under the trust are put in peril by some other power
holder within the trust structure. Protectors or 'guardians' with reserved powers over the
trustees and trust property are more prevalent in offshore trusts than they are in the major
onshore jurisdictions. Where there is a protector with extensive reserve powers, can it be
removed if, in the exercise (or refusal to exercise) its powers, the beneficiaries' interests are
put at risk. It has been held that the Court's inherent jurisdiction extends to the removal of
a protector.105 This power is said to flow from the fiduciary nature of a protector's office,106
although in the authors' view the better analysis is that the Court's power to remove a protector turns not on the innate fiduciary nature of the protector's office but on the nature of
the duties that arise from the powers which the protector holds. The guiding principles for
the exercise of the jurisdiction to remove a protector are said to be akin to those applicable
to the removal of a trustee.107 Those with locus to remove a protector are the same as those
with locus to remove a trustee: the Attorney General, the trustees, an enforcer of a noncharitable purpose trust, a beneficiary or, with leave of the Court, any other person.
Further, Jersey's trust law also provides for the legitimacy of private purpose trusts108 that
might otherwise fall foul of the traditional orthodoxy requiring there to be a beneficiary

101

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 16(1).
The circumstance in which this mechanism may be required is mercifully rare and remains more a theoretical possibility than a real one owing to the relatively greater prevalence of JFSC-regulated professional trustees as
opposed to lay individuals among Jersey's trustees. In the authors' experience it has never happened.
104 As to which see below.

in whose favour the Court may decree performance.109 The absence of beneficiaries is
­compensated for by the office of 'enforcer', whose duty is it to enforce the trust in relation to
its purposes.110 An enforcer is a distinct office from that of trustee, although the two offices
are subject to the same no-profit and no-conflict rules.111 There is currently no Jersey case
law on the principles to be applied for the removal of an enforcer of a private purpose trust.
The principles upon which the jurisdiction to remove an enforcer is likely to turn, as in the
case of protectors, are not simply on the nature of their office but on the nature of the duties
that arise from the powers which the enforcer holds in relation to the trust and the trust
property. While it may be tempting to elide the two, the roles of an enforcer and a protector
are fundamentally different which would suggest the analogy that has been made between
trustees and protectors as to the basis upon which the latter can be removed by the Court
does not easily extend to an enforcer. We are in the main concerned with the removal of an
enforcer to a private purpose trust. To the extent that the Attorney General can be regarded
as an enforcer of trusts for charitable purposes, it is the authors' suggestion that he cannot
be removed from this role,112 although an enforcer of a charitable trust may be subject to
removal.
The grounds upon which an application to remove an enforcer are likely to be based are
(1) for breach of the no-profit/no-conflict rules in Article 21(4) of the Trusts Law; (2) where
the enforcer is unfit, incapable, unwilling or refuses to act; and (3) where the enforcer purports to assume a role that is inappropriate to his office so as to encroach on the role and
powers to the trustees. Each of these grounds is essentially a different failure by the enforcer
to comply with its duty to enforce the terms of the private purpose trust which by that fact
must put the sound administration of the trust (and the objects) at risk. The Jersey statute,
unlike the Guernsey equivalent, is ambiguous as to the nature of the enforcer's duty to
enforce a purpose trust. In the authors' view, the Guernsey statute makes express what must
obviously be impliedly a power of a fiduciary rather than limited nature on the basis that
the enforcer must, as a matter of practical reality, if their office is to mean anything, review
and consider whether to enforce the trust from time to time.113 The analogy between the
position of a beneficiary and an enforcer in relation to the enforcement of the trust may

109 Morice v Bishop of Durham (1804) 9 Ves 399; note that Jersey is not alone among the offshore financial
centres in permitting purpose trusts, which exist also in the Bahamas, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the
Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man and Guernsey.
110 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 13(1). As to the nature of this duty, the Trusts (Guernsey) Law 2007, s 12(2),
which expressly provides that the duty is fiduciary, may provide a guide. In the case of charitable trusts without
beneficiaries (such as the trustees of sub-trusts) the role of an enforcer of the trust's charitable purposes is fulfilled
by the AG.
111 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 13(3); Re VR Family Trust v Van Rooyen (n 6) (protector subject to nonconflict rule).
112 While no authority is provided for this proposition it seems to us obvious that a trust for charitable purposes cannot oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the AG to protect the public interest. However, it may be possible to exercise a power in the trust instrument to change the proper law of the trust, the exclusive jurisdiction to
which disputes concerning it are to be subject and replace the Jersey trustees so as to remove the structure from
Jersey altogether. Such a power would have to be exercised with extreme caution so as to ensure there was no vitiating factor that would render its exercise void under the doctrine of fraud on a power. But note Crociani & Ors
v Crociani & Ors [2014] UKPC 40, affirming the Jersey Court of Appeal [2014] JCA 089 to the effect that exceptional circumstances may justify the Court overriding a so-called exclusive jurisdiction clause.
113 See Trusts (Guernsey) Law 2007, s 12(2); no equivalent provision exists in Jersey's Trusts Law.

appear convenient but is not wholly apposite. If an enforcer is to be equated with a beneficiary in relation to the enforcement of the trust, there is clearly no difficulty with the principle that a beneficiary, who holds certain powers, must exercise them as a fiduciary.114 While
an enforcer effectively stands in as a beneficiary in relation to the enforcement of a trust
that is, by its nature without beneficiaries, the analogy with a beneficiary is a limited one.
The office of enforcer could not sensibly be regarded as giving the enforcer any ascertained
or contingent beneficial interest in the trust assets from which her right to enforce the trust
emerges. Neither can it be said that a beneficiary who fails to enforce a trust of which they
are a beneficiary can or should be removed as a beneficiary, whereas a failure to enforce the
trust would be the main basis on which an enforcer is most likely to be removed.
While an enforcer is under a duty (whether or not fiduciary) to enforce a purpose trust, a
serious practical difficulty arises as to whom that duty is owed. Locus to remove an enforcer
is restricted to the Attorney General (whose role is restricted only to charitable trusts),
the trustee or, with leave of the Court, by any other person.115 By definition a beneficiary
of a purpose trust cannot seek the enforcer's removal. This clearly represents a defect in
­Jersey's non-charitable purpose trust regime because it principally relies on the trustee to
take action against an enforcer who is failing in his task to hold the trustee to its duties.
It may be argued that where the trustee is put on notice that the enforcer is in breach of
the no-conflict rule or is unwilling, refusing, unfit or incapable of acting, by virtue of its
own fiduciary obligations, the trustee are under a duty to apply to the Royal Court for the
removal of the enforcer and the appointment of a new one.116 However, the point must be
made as to whether this is in practice or principle a credible mechanism.117
In Re VR Family Trust-v-Van Rooyen,118 the trust instrument declared that no power was
vested in the protector in a fiduciary capacity. The powers were held to be limited and had
to be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and for the purpose for which they
were given even if the protector was not under a duty to consider from time to time whether
to exercise them.
What if the trustee wishes to retire but the protector (or settlor to whom the power to
appoint a new trustee is reserved) will not exercise the power to remove and replace them?
What we are concerned with here is not the loss of the trustee's right to retire from office
but the effective veto a protector or settlor may have over the appointment of a new trustee.
In those circumstances it is open to the trustee to apply to court for an order to remove
themselves from office. The protector's deliberate failure or refusal to exercise a power to
replace the trustee without a legitimate reason by reference to the beneficiaries' interests

Removal under Inherent Jurisdiction

may amount to a breach of the fiduciary duty attaching to that power.119 Obstinacy on the
part of the protector in relation to the exercise of its powers may provide grounds for the
removal of the protector. A settlor with reserve powers to veto an incoming trustee cannot
be removed, but the nature of the power reserved to the settlor is still of a limited character
and the Court may exercise the powers for them. Article 17(3) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984 provides that a trustee with power to appoint a new trustee who fails to exercise that
power may be removed from office by the Court. A protector with the same power would
by virtue of the fact that a power to appoint a trustee is (at the very least) a limited power120
also be liable to be removed under the Court's inherent jurisdiction.
In the Matter of the Representation of C, D, E & F and In the Matter of the A & B Trusts121
concerned the irretrievable breakdown in relations between the beneficiaries and protector
to the extent that the overwhelming majority of the other adult beneficiaries wanted the
protector removed. The root of the breakdown in relations was the protector's misconceived
view of himself as the 'living guardian and enforcer' of the settlors' wishes.122 The powers vested in the protector were: (1) to withhold its consent to the exercise of the trustee's
dispositive powers; (2) to add and exclude beneficiaries; and (3) to appoint and dismiss
trustees. The Court held that it could be no part of the function of a protector with limited
powers of the kind conferred on the protector to ensure that a settlor's wishes were carried
out any more than it was open to the settlor himself to insist on them being carried out.
A trustee's duty as regards a letter of wishes was no more than to have due regard to such
matters without any obligation to follow them. And a protector's duty could, correspondingly, be no higher than to do his best to see that trustees have due regard to the settlor's
wishes. The protector was removed, notwithstanding a finding that that the settlor's motivation for the way he exercised his role as protector was bona fides, his behaviour being driven
by conviction that it was his duty to ensure that the trusts were administered according to his
perception of what the settlor would have wanted and that it was all the more important for
him to remain steadfast to that role at a time when the original trustee had resigned.
In In the Matter of the Freiburg Trust123 the written consent of the protector was required for
the exercise by the trustee of certain of its powers including the power to make appointments
of capital and income to any of the beneficiaries. While the trustee had power to appoint a
protector, it could only do so if the office was vacated. However the office of protector could
only be deemed vacated if the protector was found by the trustees to be of unsound mind
or subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The trustees issued proceedings before
the Royal Court to remove the protector citing examples of misappropriation of funds from
the trust fund and a conviction and sentence to a term of imprisonment for fraud. In those
circumstances, the Court did not hesitate to remove the protector, notwithstanding any
provision to that effect in the trust instrument or the 1984 Law, holding:
It would be quite unconscionable and unthinkable that this Court should have no jurisdiction
to remove a Protector who was thwarting the execution of a trust or who was otherwise unfit to

exercise the functions entrusted to him by the Trust Instrument. Is this a proper case to exercise the
inherent jurisdiction that we have asserted? [The protector]… is the antithesis of a Protector. Far
from protecting the Trust, he [the protector] has actually defrauded it and misappropriated part
of the Trust fund.

10-30

Having removed the protector, the Court did not seek to replace him but directed that the
trustee could henceforth execute the terms of the trust without requiring the consent of
any other person in relation to the exercise of its powers. The Freiburg trust was drafted
in terms that the requirement for the protector's prescribed consent was only be operative
while there remained a protector capable of exercising the consent and that in the absence
of a protector it was the protector's effective power to veto that fell into abeyance rather
than the trustee's. Where the terms of a trust are drafted so as to always require the consent
of a protector and the protector is removed, we are doubtful whether the Royal Court has
power to unilaterally take a blue pencil to the requirement for a protector at all.

F. Costs of Applications to Remove a Trustee
10-31

10-32

Proceedings to remove a trustee are hostile proceedings to which the usual rule is that
costs follow the event. A trustee who defends proceedings which are brought to secure his
removal and in which his defence fails, may not only be deprived of his costs, but may be
ordered to pay the plaintiff 's costs.124 Where the trustee is ordered to pay costs, the question will be whether they should be on the standard or indemnity basis.125 The threshold at which the Court may order indemnity costs is whether the behaviour of the paying
party has been unreasonable.126 The question of costs then turns on the Court's view as to
whether the trustee's refusal to resign when requested was reasonable.
It will not be reasonable for a trustee to refuse to resign in the face of a plain and obvious
conflict of interest.127 Such a plain and obvious conflict of interest arose In The Matter of the
E, L, O and R Trusts between the interests of two groups of beneficiaries of two trusts which
shared the same trustee. The dispute arose out of the conduct of the affairs of the company,
which was the sole asset of all the various trusts. It was held that the conflict was so obvious
that there was no justification for the trustee seeking the directions of the Court. The trustee issued a Representation for directions as to what it should do; however, the trustee subsequently withdrew the proceedings after one of the beneficiaries refused to provide funds
to the trustee to meet the costs of the Representation. The beneficiaries then issued a second
Representation seeking the removal of the trustee on grounds of the conflict. Shortly before
the matter was due to be heard by the Royal Court the trustee agreed to retire. The Court
was asked to assess the reasonableness of the trustee's conduct in not resigning earlier. The
representors in the second Representation submitted that the trustee has acted unreasonably in not retiring earlier and that accordingly its remuneration and legal costs incurred

in connection with the two Representations should not be payable out of the trust funds.
The fact that there was no criticism of the trustee's administration of the trust up until the
point at which a plain and obvious conflict of interest arose was irrelevant to the Court's
determination as to the trustee's conduct and its impact on the question of costs.
It was held that the trustee's costs of the first Representation were unreasonably incurred
and accordingly the trustee was not entitled to be indemnified for them, nor was it entitled
to charge remuneration for time spent in connection with those proceedings. The trustee
was also ordered to pay the costs of the other parties incurred in those proceedings from
its personal assets, albeit on the standard rather than indemnity basis. However, the other
parties were awarded their costs against the trustee personally on the indemnity basis on
the second Representation. That second Representation was necessitated by the trustee's
sudden decision to withdraw the first Representation because it was not receiving its fees
and costs. The Court held that if the trustee believed that there was a genuine issue as to
whether it should retire which required the Court's attention, it was incumbent upon the
trustee to see the matter through to conclusion. There were ample trust assets from which it
could ultimately have received remuneration if the Court had taken the view that the trustee had acted reasonably in bringing the first Representation (which on the facts it did not).
Its decision to withdraw the proceedings was held thoroughly unreasonable and resulted
in extra costs being incurred by the other parties in bringing the second Representation.
The second Representation arose only as a result of the trustee's continued refusal to retire.
Accordingly, the same principles applied and the trustee was ordered to bear its own legal
costs incurred in connection with those proceedings personally and was not permitted to
charge fees for time spent in relation to those proceedings.
In a short postscript to the judgment the Royal Court was keen to stress that its judgment
was not to be taken as a general proposition that a trustee who is requested to retire should
do so immediately. A trustee who seeks directions will not be denied its costs before agreeing to retire. The decision as to costs in In the Matter of the E, L, O & R Trusts is particular
to the plain and obvious conflict which made it (again) plain and obvious that it was thoroughly unreasonable of the trustee not to recognise that it was in an impossible position
and had no option but to retire. The Court acknowledged that in many cases the trustee's
position will be far less clear-cut. In many cases, even where the Court's decision is that
the trustee should be removed, the Court will not necessarily conclude that the trustee
has acted in such a way that it should be deprived it of its costs or remuneration. A trustee
which is acting in good faith in what it perceives to be the best interests of the trust and the
beneficiaries as a whole will not be deprived of its costs unless it has behaved unreasonably.
That affords both trustees and the Court a margin of appreciation as to differences within
the trust as to whether the trustee should continue in office or not.
A beneficiary who unsuccessfully seeks the removal of a trustee will normally be ordered
to pay the costs of the application.128 It follows that the beneficiaries' and trustees' cost
risk in proceedings to remove the trustee are asymmetric. While a beneficiary will usually
have to pay the costs of the application if it loses; a trustee will only be ordered to pay the
costs of the application if it is held to have been unreasonable in refusing to resign. It may

Retirement, Removal or Replacement

be that the trustee will be removed owing to the breakdown in the relationship even if the
­allegations of wrongdoing fail. Even if the trustee is removed there remains the possibility
that its refusal to resign when requested was not unreasonable or where there is doubt as to
that question, the trustee may still be entitled to its indemnity for the costs of the application.
For a beneficiary to seek its costs from the trust fund requires the beneficiary to bring the
application within the categories identified in Buckton129 so that the application to remove
the trustee is treated as being necessary for the administration of the trust and the costs of
all parties are necessarily incurred for the benefit of the trust estate, regarded as a whole. In
such cases the costs of all parties are directed to be taxed as between solicitor and client and
paid out of the trust estate, thereby providing an equivalent of the indemnity basis enjoyed
by trustees to beneficiaries as well.130 Where the beneficiary succeeds in removing the trustee they are usually entitled to their costs however, as it is not uncommon in litigation that
the question of costs can be the tail that wags the dog. In order to secure the best chance of
protecting their position on costs in the event that the application to remove fails, in the
absence of a clear breach of trust, applications may be brought as Representations so as to
engage the administrative jurisdiction of the court.
An order for the removal of trustees by the Court is usually sought under Article 51(2)(a)(ii)
of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.131 In a case where a claim for removal of trustees forms
part of the relief sought in a breach of trust claim, the position as to costs will be governed
by the general principles applicable to breach of trust actions.132 The plaintiff is not obliged
to succeed on every charge of misconduct raised against the trustee; a trustee who fails to
resign and has to be removed will normally be ordered to pay the costs of the beneficiary,
usually on the indemnity basis, as well as bear his own costs.133 However, a beneficiary
who persists in seeking the removal of a trustee on grounds of misconduct, but secures the
removal on other grounds, may be ordered to bear his own costs.134 A trustee who refuses
to retire and has to be removed by the court owing to an obvious conflict of interest may
be refused his costs.135 If a trustee is removed on the ground of conflict of interest, the
court might normally be expected to make an order for costs against the trustee, though
might allow the trustee his costs in special circumstances, for example where the conflict is
expressly authorised by the terms of the trust, but the court nonetheless considers that the
trustee should be removed.136 A trustee removed on grounds other than misconduct is at
less risk of being ordered to pay the applicant's costs, and will obtain an order for costs from
the trust fund if he acted reasonably in defending the claim for removal.137

Transition between Trustees

407

A trustee may be tempted to continue in office and vigorously defend what it perceives as
a not well-founded claim from beneficiaries for its removal out of concern that if it fails
to refute the allegations, it will be taken as acknowledging them. The reputational risk to
a trustee in being perceived to be at fault, so as to be worthy of removal, is an acute one in
a jurisdiction like Jersey where the vast majority of trustees are professional. The trustee
would be well advised to consider making an offer of settlement containing positive proposals for the appointment of a new independent trustee of good standing in his place, with
whom the beneficiaries might enjoy a better relationship, without in any way conceding the
allegations of misconduct, and thereby protecting his position as to costs so far as possible.
Beneficiaries who unsuccessfully seek the removal of trustees will normally be ordered to
pay the costs.138
If a trustee is purportedly removed from office under an express power in the trust instrument on some specified ground, and the trustee challenges the exercise of that power of
removal, costs will normally follow the event. Unless the matter can be resolved by agreement with the beneficiaries, all being of full age and capacity, a trustee purportedly removed
by what the trustee reasonably considers to be an improper exercise of such a power139 can
apply to the court for directions as to whether he ought to act on the purported removal
and cause or allow the trust assets to vest in the new trustee purportedly appointed in his
place without being at personal risk as to costs. In those circumstances, the trustee's affidavit
should set out the material facts and the result of his consultation with adult ­beneficiaries,
and explain the nature of and reason for his concern as to the exercise of the power.

IV. The Transition between Outgoing and Incoming Trustees
A court order removing a trustee and appointing a replacement (as is usually the case) does
not in and of itself resolve all issues concerning the rights and liabilities of the outgoing
and incoming trustee. There is the outstanding issue of the vesting of the trust property in
the new trustee.140 There is also the question of what provision should be made as to the
outgoing trustee's outstanding liabilities as trustee as these cannot usually be the subject of
an assignment to the incoming trustee.141 The circumstances in which the Court is likely to
be required to exercise its jurisdiction to remove a trustee means that it is only in rare cases
that an order for retirement and appointment can take effect immediately. The usual practice is for the Court to grant an order directing the trustee to retire, once a suitable replacement has been found and once appropriate transitional arrangements have been made.142
The position of an outgoing (ie removed) trustee is governed by Article 34 of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984. Article 34(1) and (2) provide that outgoing trustees shall duly surrender
138

Fane v Fane (1879) 13 ChD 228.

139 A power to remove removal is usually a fiduciary power and can only be validly exercised for the benefit of

the beneficiaries as a whole; In re VR Family Trust (n 24).
140 Jersey's trust law, unlike English law, does not provide for the automatic vesting of trust assets on a transfer
of trusteeship; see Trustee Act 1925, s 40.
141 These issues will also be faced by any trustee wishing to retire, desiring perhaps to extricate itself from a difficult relationship or where there is a concern that the trust assets are tainted as the proceeds of unlawful conduct.

Retirement, Removal or Replacement

trust property subject to being first provided with reasonable security for liabilities, whether
existing, future, contingent or otherwise if the outgoing trustees require it.143 The trustees
are under a duty proactively to pursue the transfer of the assets, subject only to their right to
be provided with reasonable security for their fees and any liabilities, by (1) instructing Jersey lawyers to draft the formal documents by which the assets would be appointed to the new
trust and any indemnities that should be given; (2) marshalling and preparing the assets so
that they were ready to be transferred; (3) ascertaining the identity of the entities to whom
the assets were to be transferred; (4) where necessary, obtaining advice on the steps required
to effect the transfer, the tax implications (if any) and the cost to be incurred in the actual
conveyance or transfer of the assets in the jurisdictions in which they were located; (5) setting
out a timetable for the transfer of the assets; (6) providing information to the new trustee to
enable it properly to accept the assets; (7) carrying out due diligence on the new trustee; and
(8) answering the new trustee's reasonable questions concerning the assets.144 It follows that
if, and only if, reasonable security is provided, is the trustee obliged to part with trust property even if subject to a court order to resign.145 Whether security was 'reasonable' depends
on the circumstances of an individual case. There is no general principle that a trustee
should always accept an escrow arrangement in a dispute over fees (eg such an arrangement
would not ordinarily apply in fee disputes between beneficiaries and trustees who were to
remain in office).146 The trustee has a right to seek security by way of an indemnity and the
extension of that security to their officers and employees is not to be considered unreasonable or unusual. However, an indemnity could not in general, reasonably be insisted on to
extend to officers and employees of the trustee's associates or to companies in which the
trust assets had been invested.147 Article 34(3) provides that an outgoing trustee that duly
surrenders the trust property in the manner contemplated by Article 34(1) shall be released
from liability to any beneficiary, trustee or person interested under the trust aside from
liabilities that outgoing trustees incur as a result of their own breach of trust or claims to
recover trust assets in the possession of the outgoing trustees. As to what amounts to 'reasonable security', readers should be aware that until recently Jersey law has no equivalent
to the English floating charge and it was not possible for a new trustee to charge the trust
fund in favour of the outgoing trustee. Part 3 of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 it
is now possible to achieve a floating charge like security interest over all present and future
intangible movable property held by the grantor of the security from time to time.
What usually follows an order for removal is a transitional period in which the outgoing
and incoming trustees engage in a negotiated de-coupling of the personage of the outgoing trustee from his office. Such negotiations will take into account the outgoing trustees'
and successor trustees' respective obligations and legitimate interests, but paramount must

be the interests of the beneficiaries. The efficient management of such negotiations can be
particularly challenging in circumstances where the:

outgoing trustees' liabilities are subject to contingencies;
parties disagree regarding the probability that the contingencies will materialise;
quantum of the outgoing trustees' liabilities (if they do arise) is uncertain;
relationship between the settlor, protector or beneficiaries and the outgoing trustees
has completely broken down;
outgoing trustees consider that they may be exposed to liabilities in the near future
but have limited understanding of the basis, amount or probability of their exposure;
trust fund is illiquid;148 or
outgoing or successor trustees are experiencing difficulty accessing liquid assets in the
trust fund owing to the influence of the settlor or other third parties, or for other
reasons.

It is impossible to contemplate every scenario that may arise when outgoing trustees' security is being negotiated, the circumstances of each trust being unique, but the following
principles should guide the transition process. The outgoing trustees should actively prepare for the trust assets and administration to be transferred to the successor trustees, notwithstanding that the outcome regarding the outgoing trustees' indemnity for its liabilities
may still be pending.149 Both outgoing and successor trustees should take into account the
interests of the beneficiaries, notwithstanding that the outgoing and successor trustees may
have legitimate personal interests that they wish to protect.150 The outgoing trustees should,
in most cases, avoid retention of the entire trust fund as security for their outstanding
costs, particularly where the value of the trust fund considerably exceeds their outstanding
costs.151 Jersey law is said to recognise an equitable proprietary right in the nature of or
analogous to a non-possessory lien in favour of a retiring trustee.152 The outgoing trustees
should make reasonable enquiries as to the nature and amount of their contingent and
future liabilities with respect to the trust and promptly communicate the outcome of those
enquiries to the successor trustees.153 It is insufficient for the outgoing trustees to simply
refer the successor trustees to the settlor or the protector or other persons so the successor
trustees can, in effect, initiate their own fact-finding exercise regarding the outgoing trustees' liabilities. It is the outgoing trustees who need to actively inform the successor trustees
directly of the nature and basis of the outgoing trustees' liabilities. If the outgoing trustees'
maximum exposure is unknown, outgoing trustees can retain enough of the trust fund to

148 The JFSC's Codes of Practice for Trust Company Business, Sch 2 defines illiquid assets as for example,
land and buildings, intangibles (goodwill, intellectual property etc) amounts receivable from shareholders and/
or directors and/or related parties (unless in the ordinary course of business and outstanding balances are settled
every 60 days), debtors which are more than 90 days overdue; and margins taken against bank guarantees.

152 Although in the authors' view the references to the existence of a trustee's lien are sparse, obiter and at
best oblique and may not be safe to rely upon for a retiring trustee to fully protect its position (see In re Esteem

cover the worst-case scenario, 'calculated on reasonable and not fanciful assumptions'.154
The outgoing trustees may, in certain circumstances, retain the entire trust fund for their
liabilities where the maximum amount of those liabilities cannot be ascertained.155 However, the circumstances where this is appropriate: (1) are likely to be exceptional; (2) may
only exist for a limited period following the outgoing trustees' retirement or removal; and
(3) would require the outgoing trustees to reasonably demonstrate why doing so is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances.
In a recent series of decisions of the Royal Court in the Dick litigation, it became apparent
shortly after the trustee was removed from office by the Court that the now former trustee,
had, before its removal, executed and secured for itself charges over certain of the trust
assets in favour of itself as security for borrowing it alleged had been incurred by it in the
course of its administration. The effect of those charges was to effectively impound the
effective refinancing and administration of already illiquid trust assets while the security
interests persisted. What followed were a series of hearings by which the court-appointed
incumbent trustee and beneficiaries sought orders lifting the security interest on the basis
that they were vitiated by a conflict of interest.156

A. Provision of Trust Records to the Successor Trustees
10-45

An outgoing trustee is under a positive duty to fully and actively cooperate on a transfer
of trusteeship by promptly providing the new trustee with all trust documents and correspondence and answering reasonable questions.157 Successor trustees will be unable to
effectively administer the trust and fulfil their duties without at least having access to the
trust and supplementary instruments; the beneficiaries' identity and contact details; and
the current details of the trust's assets and liabilities. The Royal Court has a discretion,
under its inherent jurisdiction to supervise and, if necessary, intervene in the administration of trusts, to direct that specific documents or information not be disclosed by the
outgoing trustee.158 However, legal advice paid for by trustee out of the trust fund not is
not to be considered 'trust property' under Article 1(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 and
an outgoing trustee is not required to hand it over to new trustee under Article 34(1).159

10-46

In certain cases, the outgoing trustees may consider that their retention of shares in a
private company or an investment portfolio, which is effectively controlled by the settlor
(apparently determined to frustrate the outgoing trustees' attempts to access trust assets),
does not constitute reasonable security for the outgoing trustees' liabilities. Outgoing trustees are not required to readily accept a charge over shares or other assets that are subject
to considerable direct or indirect influence by the settlor. This is particularly so where the
settlor's conduct suggests that they may seek to frustrate the outgoing trustees' legitimate

access to, or enforcement of, the security.160 In these circumstances, the outgoing trustees
may consider it reasonable that they retain (notionally) the entire trust assets (including
the trust records) until they reach an agreement with the successor trustees regarding the
outgoing trustees' security. That approach would rarely by itself, if at all, be considered proactive or reasonable because it effectively prevents the incoming from being able to effectively administer the trust. As a matter of priority, outgoing trustees should proactively and
efficiently:
1.
2.
3.

4.

ascertain the nature and extent of their outstanding costs and the estimated costs of the
transfer process and provide this information to the successor trustees;
take reasonable steps to determine the nature and extent of their liabilities;
inform the successor trustees of the nature of their concerns in as much detail as reasonably possible given the information available, even if the outgoing trustees do not
yet clearly understand the nature of their liabilities; and
propose to the successor trustees a procedure and timetable pursuant to which the issue
of the outgoing trustees' security may be resolved, taking into account the information
regarding the outgoing trustees' liabilities available, the nature of the trust fund, the
impact of costs and delays on the successor trustees' ability to properly administer the
trust, the interests of the beneficiaries and any other relevant factors.

Where the trust fund is illiquid or inaccessible to the outgoing trustees, the successor trustees and any other parties that exert practical control over all or part of the trust fund
should (and can be ordered to) facilitate the provision to the outgoing trustees of a reasonable sum from the trust fund or some other source to secure the outgoing trustees' costs of
making key trust records available.
It may be unreasonable for successor trustees, by accepting their appointments as trustees,
to place themselves in a position where neither they nor the outgoing trustees have any
access to the liquid trust assets or other means to fund the transfer of administration. Successor trustees, before accepting their appointment and as part of their due diligence, would
place themselves in a better position to manage the negotiation process if they have made
reasonable enquiries to ascertain:
1.
2.
3.
4.

the nature and value of the trust assets, including the liquidity of the trust fund;
the nature and extent of the settlor's or beneficiaries' direct or indirect control over
trust assets;
the outgoing trustees' current position in relation to security for their liabilities; and
the likelihood of any difficulties that either party may experience accessing trust assets
to fund the cost of work performed by either party in connection with the transfer
process, or provision of security to the outgoing trustees.

160 See Caversham Trustees Ltd v Patel and Ors [2007] JRC 070, where the outgoing trustees were granted security for their outstanding fees in the form of a charge over shares in a company that was controlled by the settlor.
Notwithstanding that, the settlor's Jersey lawyers were provided with the share certificate of an underlying company of the trust to hold as security on behalf of the outgoing trustees, the outgoing trustees remained as directors
of the underlying company, court orders of the Jersey Court compelled the settlor to honour the security arrangement, and the settlor fraudulently sold the property held by the underlying company and retained the proceeds.

Retirement, Removal or Replacement

Where the outgoing trustees do not have effective control over the trust fund,161 the
­incoming trustee should make a payment into the outgoing trustees' client account or
an escrow account to secure the outgoing trustees' reasonable costs of providing the trust
documents that the incoming trustees may require. This is the appropriate approach notwithstanding any potential claim the incoming trustees consider they may have against the
outgoing trustees that would require the outgoing trustees to compensate the trust fund.
The outgoing trustees may, rightly or wrongly, consider that the incoming trustees' claims
for compensation on behalf of the trust fund do not have any merit. In any event, it will
usually be practical for the determination of such claims to be deferred until the transfer
of administration has been completed. The successor trustees' provision of security to the
outgoing trustees does not ordinarily constitute a waiver of claims they have against the
outgoing trustees regarding their administration of the trust.162

B. Contingent Liabilities and the Probability that They Will Materialise
10-50

The trustee is, by law, entitled to be indemnified from the trust fund for all liabilities reasonably incurred.163 Frequently, contingent liabilities that are unlikely to materialise may be
appropriately secured simply by the indemnities suggested in templates such as the STEP
Guide.164 It is the author's view that given the circumstances of every trust are unique, an
instrument of indemnity should be a bespoke document, tailored to the precise requirements of the trust for which it is to be used. There are occasions where the templates in
works such as the STEP Guide may be unsuitable and/or indemnities may be of limited utility given the nature of the trust and the trust assets.165 An outgoing trustee should provide
a detailed explanation to the incoming trustees if they consider this to be the case. Where
there is ongoing disagreement about the probability of liabilities materialising, the parties
should explore whether security made up of a combination of cash, charges over intangible
movable trust assets and indemnities is appropriate; and consider putting in place a timetable pursuant to which the outgoing trustees may release one or more assets retained as
security at certain agreed stages, taking into account the nature of the claims and limitation
periods166 on which the parties acknowledge it is less probable that the liabilities will arise;
whether a preliminary independent opinion from appropriate counsel on the issue would
assist resolution; or whether an independent expert determination is required.

assets.

Transition between Trustees

413

Where the incoming trustees consider that the provision to the outgoing trustees of ­certain
trust assets or types of security would have a material adverse impact on the administration of the trust, they should seek to offer a constructive alternative proposal to the outgoing trustees. There may be instances where the value of the trust assets is such that the
incoming trustees are unable to provide security, including an indemnity, of any real value
to the outgoing trustees. In such circumstances, the outgoing trustee will have to look
elsewhere for such provision.167 In the recent English case of Oakhurst v Blackstar,168 the
settlor (Oakhurst) had established four employer-funded retirement benefit trust schemes
(the schemes). The schemes were established primarily to provide benefits for directors
of Oakhurst. Blackstar was the trustee of each of the schemes and Oakhurst purported to
remove Blackstar as trustee and appoint a successor trustee (Church Street Trustees Ltd-
'Church Street') in Blackstar's place for each scheme. Oakhurst brought proceedings seeking declarations to confirm that Blackstar had been removed as trustee of each scheme
and that Church Street had been appointed trustee in Blackstar's place, and to clarify 'what
was required to be provided to Oakhurst by way of reasonable security and indemnities' in
the circumstances. The circumstances were unusual because the trusts' or schemes' funds,
in each case, essentially consisted of choses in action to recover unsecured loans owed by
directors or employees of Oakhurst to the trustees of respective schemes; and because the
schemes were of a nature where it was possible that arrangements would be implemented
after Blackstar's removal, which would significantly reduce the value of the choses in action
and, accordingly, the value of the indemnities provided by Church Street to Blackstar. The
Court determined that Blackstar was unlikely to be exposed to any liabilities but, despite
that, no 'reasonable professional advisor could reach the conclusion that the risk of potential liability was absolutely nil'.169 The outgoing trustee should not be left to bear whatever
degree of risk there might be of a potential liability where it runs the further risk of there
being no worthwhile indemnity in relation to it. While the outgoing trustee, or the parties
together, could consider placing further restrictions upon successor trustees in relation to
the manner in which the incoming trustees dealt with the schemes' funds (to preserve the
value of the indemnities) to do so might be objected to as an excessive fetter to the discretion of the incoming trustees and, accordingly, it was reasonable to consider alternatives.
The persons who stood to benefit from the schemes were the settlor Oakhurst and its directors and employees. Oakhurst's financial position was such that it could meet its obligations
to the outgoing trustee Blackstar if it provided the indemnities contemplated by the trust
instruments; 'as between the outgoing trustee and Oakhurst … Oakhurst and not the outgoing trustee should bear any risk which might be involved', and accordingly Oakhurst was

required to provide a personal covenant of indemnity to Blackstar, substantially in the form
contemplated by the terms of each scheme; with the indemnities provided by Oakhurst
carefully setting out the circumstances in which Blackstar could claim against any remaining trust assets and the circumstances in which it could claim under the indemnity to manage Oakhurst's concern that its provision of the indemnities could give rise to a tax charge.
Oakhurst v Blackstar required the Court to fashion a solution in a commercial context.
It remains to be seen, although it seems unlikely that a court would require settlors of family
discretionary trusts to provide indemnities to outgoing trustees where the settlor has little
or no ongoing involvement with the trust. The provision of an indemnity or other form
of security from settlors, or perhaps even beneficiaries in certain cases, to the outgoing
trustees can be explored by the outgoing and incoming trustees as part of the negotiation
process in relation to the outgoing trustees' security. However, the circumstances in which
courts may require settlors or beneficiaries to provide outgoing trustees with indemnities
and other security on retirement or removal are likely to be limited. It is open to trustees to
include a requirement in their terms and conditions (to which the settlor is usually a party)
for the settlor to provide a specific indemnity (and other forms of security if reasonably
required) to an outgoing trustee immediately before their removal.170
It is another matter whether the indemnity is ultimately of any value when circumstances
for enforcement of the indemnity may ultimately arise, taking into consideration the financial circumstances and location of the settlor at the time of enforcement, and the possibility
that a court may strictly construe whether the indemnity is enforceable in the circumstances
that exist when the trust service provider seeks to enforce the indemnity.

C. Retention of the Entire Trust Fund as Reasonable Security
10-54

Where the value of the trust fund significantly exceeds the level of the outgoing trustee's
liabilities and the outgoing trustees have control of the trust assets or access to liquid
assets within the structure, the outgoing trustees should transfer sufficient trust assets to
the incoming trustees to enable them to settle expenses and make distributions without
recourse to the outgoing trustees. As further information clarifying the nature of their
liabilities becomes available the outgoing trustees should consider the extent to which
they can transfer trust assets into the control of the incoming trustees without depriving
themselves of the means to satisfy liabilities from those assets as they fall due. The outgoing trustees should not retain trust assets that they reasonably consider, on a conservative
basis and with the information they have available from time to time, are not required to
secure their liabilities. Without expert advice, it is likely that a trustee will adopt a more
conservative approach to what assets they should retain than if they receive professional
advice that assists them to understand the nature of their liabilities. This is understandable
and reasonable, albeit the outgoing trustees should be mindful of potentially adverse cost
consequences they may suffer as a result of their failure to promptly mobilise to ascertain
170 This may of course only be a partial solution where (1) the trusteeship has changed hands between the date
of the original settlement and the time the indemnity comes to be enforced and no provision has been made for
successor trustees to claim against the settlor through the original trustee and (2) the whereabouts, means of and
prospects of enforceability against the settlor at the time the indemnity comes to be enforced are uncertain.

their exposure when it became reasonably clear that successor trustees were likely to be
appointed to replace them. However, the outgoing trustees' transfer of at least part of the
trust assets in the manner outlined above to some extent demonstrates their recognition of
the legitimate needs of the incoming trustees and may help to facilitate more collaborative
negotiations and reduce their exposure to adverse costs orders. An approach whereby an
outgoing trustee retains sufficient trust assets to meet prospective liabilities and drip-feeds
assets to the incoming trustee as and when it considers it safe to do so is not inconsistent
with the language in Article 34(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law which does not provide that
outgoing trustees may ignore the impact of their retention of trust assets on the administration of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries as a whole by, for example, retaining a
sum that is clearly disproportionate to their exposure for any period of time.171

D. Independent Advice
An outgoing trustee concerned as to its exposure for outgoing liabilities may have insufficient information to ascertain the nature of their liabilities and may accordingly obtain
advice on those issues. Advice may be required in more than one jurisdiction.172 Incoming
trustees may be reluctant to entertain the outgoing trustees' request for time and funds with
which to procure advice regarding the outgoing trustees' liabilities where, for example, the
outgoing trustees have known for some time that they were soon to cease acting as trustees
yet did not procure such advice in a timely fashion; the incoming trustees believe that the
outgoing trustees are not exposed to any liabilities other than costs the outgoing trustees
may charge or incur in connection with the transfer of administration; or the incoming
trustees are under pressure from the beneficiaries to quickly secure the trust assets and
make a clean break with the outgoing trustees so that the successor trustees can focus on
the day-to-day administration of the trust. In these circumstances, the outgoing trustees
should consider:
1.
2.

10-55

instructing an advisor to provide impartial preliminary advice;
informing the advisor that the advice will be provided to the successor trustees who
may later wish to jointly instruct the advisor to provide a more substantive report, if
considered appropriate; and
providing the successor trustees with the outgoing trustees' instructions to the independent advisor and the advisor's fee estimate, advice and invoice.

3.

Frequently, presuming the preliminary advice arranged in the above manner is obtained at
modest or reasonable cost and does not reveal the outgoing trustees' concerns to be fanciful, the incoming trustees will have difficulty arguing that the costs of such advice should
not be met from the trust fund, notwithstanding that the advice may have determined, on a
preliminary basis, that the outgoing trustees clearly have no exposure or minimal exposure,
or that their exposure is unlikely to materialise. Persuasive independent preliminary advice
that indicates that there is a realistic possibility that the outgoing trustees are exposed to

171

10-56

416

Retirement, Removal or Replacement

material liabilities should influence the incoming trustees to consider jointly instructing or
otherwise providing the outgoing trustees with security for the costs that they are likely to
incur when obtaining a more substantive report from the advisor. The outgoing trustees
should be as transparent as possible with the incoming trustees about their intention to
seek independent advice, the costs of the advice, their instructions and the advice itself,
regardless of the successor trustees' apparent attitude towards the outgoing trustees obtaining the advice.

E. Suggested Procedure for Securing Reasonable Security
10-57

10-58

10-59

In many cases, the following procedure should balance the legitimate interests of the outgoing trustees, successor trustees and beneficiaries. The procedure is proposed on the basis
that it would be implemented in conjunction with guidance that courts have provided,
with emphasis on the obligations of outgoing trustees, when transferring trusteeship, and
focused on facilitating a cost-effective and efficient resolution. Once the outgoing trustees
should reasonably expect that their retirement or removal is inevitable, they should consider
the liabilities to which they may be exposed and, particularly if they do not understand the
nature of their exposure, procure impartial preliminary advice about their concerns. The
incoming trustees should, before their appointment, make enquiries to ensure that on their
appointment, assuming the outgoing trustees do not seek to retain the entire trust fund as
security, they will have access to liquid trust assets to fund the outgoing trustees' costs to
transfer trusteeship and manage the process to determine the outgoing trustees' security
for their costs and liabilities. The outgoing trustees should, as soon as practicable (in many
instances this will be immediately after the successor trustees' appointment), provide the
successor trustees with (1) details of their concerns about their liabilities and a copy of any
advice they have obtained about the nature of the liabilities; (2) copies of the outgoing trustees' outstanding invoices, complete with narrative breakdowns and relevant fee schedules;
and (3) an itemised preliminary estimate of the outgoing trustees' costs of completing the
transfer of administration, including resolution of the outgoing trustees' security.
The successor trustees should facilitate the provision of security to the outgoing trustees,
in the form of liquid assets sufficient to comfortably discharge the outgoing trustees' costs
in connection with (1) providing the trust records required by the successor trustees;
(2) transferring administration of the trust and its assets to the successor trustees; and
(3) obtaining advice in connection with their liabilities (assuming this has not already been
done).
If the trust fund is illiquid, the incoming trustees should provide the outgoing trustees with
cash as security (from their own funds at first instance, if necessary) sufficient to comfortably discharge the outgoing trustees' estimation of their costs in connection with providing the trust records requested by the successor trustees. The outgoing trustees should
promptly provide the incoming trustees with the trust records they require, on receipt
of security to meet their costs of providing those documents. If the trust fund includes
sufficient liquid assets that the outgoing trustees' reasonable claims for security are not
compromised, the outgoing trustees should, as soon as possible after the above steps, facilitate provision to the incoming trustees of liquid assets sufficient to (1) meet the successor

Transition between Trustees

417

trustees' costs and expenses in connection with the day-to-day administration of the trust
for at least a ­six-month period (the period in which the issue of the nature and extent of
the outgoing trustees' security should comfortably be resolved); and (2) make distributions
and payments, such as annual distributions, of which the beneficiaries had a reasonable
expectation, as long as the provision of assets would not, on a conservative basis, materially
prejudice the outgoing trustees' security.
Concurrently, the outgoing trustees should consider, on a conservative basis, whether they
can transfer to the incoming trustees, assets that are greater in value than that set out above
without, on a conservative basis, compromising their reasonable requirements for security.
If the outgoing trustees consider that they require substantive professional advice and the
incoming trustees do not wish to jointly instruct an independent expert to determine the
nature of the outgoing trustees' liabilities, the outgoing trustees should (1) prepare instructions to an advisor on the basis that the advisor is impartially advising both the outgoing
and successor trustees, and provide a copy of these instructions to the successor trustees;
(2) procure an itemised estimate from the advisor and provide this to the successor trustees
before the advisor proceeds; (3) consider obtaining preliminary advice first if the costs of
substantive advice are significant; and (4) provide the successor trustees with full copies of
the advice, regardless of whether the successor trustees agree that the advice is necessary or
that the advisor's costs are a reasonable trust expense.
On receipt of the advice, the outgoing trustees should consider the nature of their liabilities, the assets contained in the trust fund and the efficient administration of the trust and
(so far as the composition of the trust fund makes it possible) transfer to the incoming
trustees further trust assets that the outgoing trustees consider, on a conservative basis, they
do not reasonably require to secure their liabilities, and make a proposal to the incoming
trustees detailing: (1) the nature of the security the outgoing trustees require, with reference
to particular trust assets (for example, whether cash, portfolio accounts or charges over
particular trust assets); (2) the rationale for their requirement for those particular trust
assets to be provided as their security; and (3) a timetable of when they propose the assets
provided as security shall be released to the successor trustees, paying particular regard to
limitation periods and other contingencies that may, if overcome, remove or reduce the
outgoing trustees' exposure. At this point, in most cases, the incoming trustees will have
a considerable proportion of the trust assets under their control and both incoming and
outgoing trustees should have a relatively clear understanding of the outgoing trustees' liabilities to enable a sensible resolution of the matter whether by way of mediation or other
binding independent determination or, if necessary, a court application.

The Trustee's Protection from
Personal Liability:
The Trustee's Indemnity
I. Introduction
This chapter is concerned with the trustee's right of indemnity in respect of liabilities, costs
(including the costs of litigation) and expenses incurred by the trustee in the execution of
a trust. Subject to the terms of the trust, it is well established that a trustee has a right of
reimbursement out of the trust fund in respect of liabilities, costs and expenses if properly
incurred. The trustee's indemnity also entitles third party creditors of the trustee (and in
some circumstances, the beneficiaries) to avail themselves of the trustee's right of indemnity by way of subrogation. This chapter considers the basis upon which a trustee incurs
liabilities to third parties on behalf of the trust that may be reimbursed from the fund:
liabilities in contract or tort; the costs of litigation in which the trustee is engaged; and fiscal liabilities.
A feature of the nature of a Jersey trustee's liability to third parties, which is not known in
English trust law, is that it is limited to the extent of the trust property in the trustee's hands.
This limitation has important ramifications, the boundaries of which have only recently
begun to be explored by the courts, for its interaction with the trustee's right of indemnity.
This limitation gives rise to the possibility, which has hitherto been heresy to English trust
lawyers, of an insolvent trust, where the trust assets are insufficient to meet liabilities, costs
and expenses irrespective of the solvency or otherwise of the trustee. The limited nature of
the trustee's liability to third parties also has important implications for the rights of beneficiaries, particularly given that Jersey trust law appears to adopt a different approach from
that adopted in England as to the ability of a trustee and subrogated third parties to avail
themselves of the trustee's indemnity where the trustee has committed a breach of trust or
is otherwise in default of its duties.

duties and in the exercise of its powers as trustee of the trust.1 It has yet to be determined
whether the scope of the indemnity is materially affected by the omission of 'properly'
from the formulation used in Article 26.2 As the Jersey Court of Appeal has observed, it is
possible for a trustee to act unreasonably without acting improperly and the omission of
'properly' from the Jersey legislation may have the effect of being less generous to a Jersey
trustee than the equivalent formulation prevailing in English law.3 It is difficult to imagine
a liability being improperly incurred that would nonetheless have been incurred reasonably.
A former trustee maintains its right of indemnity even after it ceases to hold office, independently of any contractual indemnity the former trustee may have secured from its successor upon its retirement.4 Notwithstanding recent confirmation from courts in both
Jersey and Guernsey5 that the trustee has an entitlement to an indemnity independent of
the statutory provision in Article 26, an express contractual indemnity remains the usual
mechanism by which an outgoing trustee's entitlement to reasonable security for liabilities
reasonably incurred, whether existing, future, contingent or otherwise before surrendering
trust property, is satisfied.6 A trustee's indemnity gives it a proprietary equitable interest in
the trust fund that takes priority over the claims of the beneficiaries in the fund.7
The reason why a trustee is entitled to an indemnity arises from the nature of the Jersey
trust and the basis upon which it is administered. It is trite law that a trust is not a legal
person but a legal relationship. The person of the trustee (whether legal or natural) is the
outward-facing legal personality of a Jersey trust. In the administration of the trust, the
trustee acts as principal and is not an agent for the beneficiaries. That is the position even
if the trustee exercises its powers following consultation with the settlor or beneficiaries, in
a manner approved of or in accordance with the wishes of the beneficiaries or settlor, or if
the powers are reserved to or exercised concurrently with a person other than the trustee.
An agent acts on behalf of a principal. The trustee is not an agent for the beneficiaries or the
settlor.8 As a general proposition of agency law, where the agent acts within the scope of its
authority, the agent will not incur any personal liability. The liability is the principal's and
not the agent's. By contrast, a trustee acts as principal in connection with the administration of the trust and is personally liable, qua trustee,9 as the counterparty to any legal relationship in which the trustee engages in the course of its administration of the trust with a

9 Whether the trustee could be described as 'personally liable' was explored extensively by the Guernsey Court
of Appeal in Investec Trust (Guernsey) Ltd v Glenalla Properties Ltd (n 4). The Court concluded that a trustee was
not personally liable; however, the only way the decision can be properly understood and reconciled with orthodox
principles of trust law is to regard 'not personally liable' as meaning 'not the personal liability of the trustee on its
own account'.

421

third party to the trust. That is so whether or not the trustee is acting in accordance with its
powers and duties. The trustee's right of indemnity serves to protect the trustee by permitting it to reimburse itself from the trust fund in respect of the liabilities it has personally
incurred, qua trustee, in the administration of the trust, with the important rider that the
liability must have been reasonably incurred. Where the trustee engages with a third party
on behalf of the trust, there are two distinct relationships. The first is between the trustee
and the third party with whom it deals or to whom it incurs liabilities. This relationship
gives rise to a personal liability for the person of the trustee, qua trustee. Generally speaking the third party dealing with a trustee is not concerned as to the terms of any the trust.
However the extent to which the third party may have recourse to the assets of the trust
(through, or by being subrogated to, the trustee's right of indemnity) is dependent upon
whether the third party knows that they are dealing with the trustee qua trustee and not
with the person of the trustee in any other capacity (including its personal capacity).10 The
second relationship that arises is between the trustee and the beneficiaries as affected by
the first relationship.11 There is no legal relationship between the third party dealing with
the trustee and the beneficiaries or the trust property, and there will therefore be no direct
recourse by the third party against the beneficiaries personally or to the trust assets other
than through the trustee (or by way of subrogation to the trustee's right of indemnity).
Normally an unsecured third party creditor of the trustee will claim its remedy against the
trustee and the trustee will claim by way of its indemnity, against the trust property.12

A. Indemnity of Particular Trustees
i. Constructive Trustees
A person who has not been properly appointed as a trustee, if they have acted in good
faith and believed themselves to have been properly appointed, is entitled to an indemnity, as would be a properly appointed trustee, and for the costs of proceedings to ratify
their appointment and purported actions while a trustee de son tort.13 There is old English authority for the proposition that where a person in a fiduciary position obtains or
uses trust property in breach of the no-profit rule the beneficiary seeking to recover such
property must give credit to the constructive trustee for the costs and expenses incurred
effecting improvements which augment its value.14

to the point of its avoidance on the basis that until the trust is avoided it is a valid trust,

The Trustee's Indemnity

notwithstanding that an order rescinding the trust for mistake has effect as though the trust
never existed.15 On the other hand, a trustee of a trust that is void ab initio is not usually
entitled to the costs of administering the trust.16 The discretion the Royal Court retains17
to authorise the remuneration of a trustee under its general supervisory jurisdiction and
under Article 26(1)(c) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 appears to apply only in respect of
valid trusts that meet the definition of a trust under Article 2 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984. A trustee who considers that the trust they purport to administer may be void should
apply for directions by issuing a Representation at the earliest opportunity. Depending
upon the reason why the trust is void, for example a failure to satisfy the certainty of objects
requirement,18 it may be possible to argue that the property is still subject to a trust (a bare
resulting trust) albeit not a trust under the instrument so as to fall within the scope of Article 2. The Court may deprive a trustee of the profit element of its fees, capping recovery at
the costs of administration only so as not to confer a windfall benefit upon the beneficiaries
in the form of free administration.19

B. Beneficiaries' Indemnity
11-8

Where a beneficiary advances money at the request of the trustee to enable the trustee to
discharge a liability that would otherwise be met by the trustee raising money against the
trust fund, the beneficiary is entitled to stand in the shoes of the trustee and has a lien on
the fund for the quantum of the sum advanced.20

C. The Indemnity of Third Parties Involved in the Administration
of the Trust
11-9

Where the trust instrument confers fiduciary powers or functions on a third party, such
as a protector or an enforcer, that third party has an implied right of indemnity in respect
of the costs reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of those functions.21 A fiduciary's
implied right of indemnity is to be equated to a trustee's right to full reimbursement and
is not therefore to be subject to taxation under rule 12/3 of the RCR 2004.22 The right of a
protector's indemnity is not directly against the fund but via the trustee, which is in turn
entitled to reimbursement from the fund by way of its own indemnity.

General Principles

423

D. The Limited Liability of Jersey Trustees
Under English trust law, a trustee is personally liable to the full extent of its personal assets
for all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by it on behalf of the trust of which it is trustee, whether or not properly or reasonably incurred. The value of the indemnity to the trustee is illusory where the trust assets are insufficient to meet the liabilities claimed against
the trustee by a third party. On orthodox English trust law principles, the trustee remains
personally liable to the full extent of the trustee's own assets to meet any shortfall to a third
party that it cannot satisfy by way of its indemnity from the trust fund.

11-10

That is not the position in Jersey law. Jersey, like neighbouring Guernsey,23 has enacted
legislation that has the effect of limiting or capping the liability of a trustee of a trust governed by Jersey law to a third party to the value of the trust assets, in circumstances where
the third party knows that the trustee is acting qua trustee.24 The relevant provision is in
the following terms:

11-11

32 Trustee's liability to third parties
(1) Where a trustee is a party to any transaction or matter affecting the trust-
(a)

if the other party knows that the trustee is acting as trustee, any claim by the other party shall
be against the trustee as trustee and shall extend only to the trust property;
(b) if the other party does not know that the trustee is acting as trustee, any claim by the other
party may be made against the trustee personally (though, without prejudice to his or her
personal liability, the trustee shall have a right of recourse to the trust property by way of
indemnity).
(2) Paragraph (1) shall not affect any liability the trustee may have for breach of trust.

The meaning and application of Article 32 has only recently come to be analysed by the
Guernsey courts, which have provided the leading authorities, subsequently affirmed by
the Royal Court in Jersey.25

11-12

i. The Meaning and Effect of Article 32(1)(a) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
There are no authorities in which the Court has resolved a doubt as to whether a third
party knows it is dealing with a trustee. The Guernsey Court of Appeal has given limited
guidance on what it means for a third party to 'know' it is dealing with a trustee. The state
of knowledge of the third party is a matter of fact to be determined in each case. It appears
that nothing more is required, such as knowledge that the trustee is empowered to enter
into the transaction, and there is no obligation for the third party to take steps to ascertain
the capacity of the trustee to deal with them. The relevant time to consider the third party's
knowledge is the time that the contract is entered into. The trustee is liable on any contract
it enters into as trustee and assumes obligations under the contract in its own name as
principal, but the contracting trustee is not required to satisfy any claim by a third party

(Amendment) Act 2003) (BVI).

The Trustee's Indemnity

with whom it contracts by recourse to the trustee's personal assets. A trustee that enters
into a contract while trustee and then ceases to hold office (in circumstances where the
contract is not novated between the third party and the successor trustee) has the right to
recover from the successor trustee by way of its indemnity such trust property as is necessary to satisfy a claim to a third party. Upon satisfying such liability to the extent of the trust
property, a trustee contracting with a third party has no further liability to the third party.
The liability of a trustee contracting with a third party extends only as far as the trust assets
that exist either in his hands or in the hands of a successor trustee, from time to time. The
contracting trustee enjoys a right to be indemnified by his successor trustee up to the limit
of the trust assets held by the successor trustee. This right is to be characterised as being an
equitable right in the form of, or, analogous to a non-possessory lien.26 A trustee contracting with a third party is entitled to satisfy the liability out of the trust property irrespective
of whether or not there is any allegation of breach of trust, whether justified or otherwise,
against the contracting trustee.27 The counterparty to a contract with a trustee does not
have a direct right of recourse to the trust assets. The creditor's claim is against the trustee
with whom they contract, who will have access to the trust assets either by way of its indemnity against the assets in its hands or by way of its indemnity as against a successor trustee.
The third party creditor may be entitled to be subrogated to the contracting trustee's right
of indemnity against a successor trustee.
The critical time at which the obligation on the trustee to expend the trust assets in satisfaction of the third party's claim arises is-somewhat imprecisely-the time when the claim
falls to be satisfied. That must be taken to mean the date of enforcement and not the date
when the liability was assumed or incurred.

ii. The Meaning and Effect of Article 32(1)(b) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
11-15

The meaning and effect of Article 32(1)(b) were not in dispute between the parties in
Glenalla and the Guernsey Court of Appeal's observations on this are strictly obiter. The
Guernsey Court's view was that Article 32(1)(b) applies when the third party does not
know it is contracting with a trustee. In these circumstances the position reverts to that
under English law where the trustee is personally liable under the contract to the full extent
of its assets. Such personal liability is, however, stated to be subject to the trustee's right of
recourse to the trust property by way of its indemnity. As with Article 32(1)(a), the trustee's
right of indemnity endures irrespective of whether or not there is any allegation of breach
of trust, whether justified or otherwise.

iii. The Relationship between Article 32(1) and 32(2) of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984
11-16

Article 32(1) and 32(2) are to be read and applied disjunctively. A beneficiary with a claim
alleging a breach of trust is not in the same position as a third party creditor to the trustee
and is not limited in its claim against the trustee to the value of the trust assets. Article 32(2)
26

The existence and nature of the trustee's lien was confirmed in In The Matter of the Z Trusts (n 4).
It may yet be significant that the trustee's right to be indemnified irrespective of the position vis-à-vis the
account with the beneficiaries seems to apply only to an alleged rather than proven breach of trust claim.

General Principles

425

preserves any rights that beneficiaries may have in a case of a breach of trust, but it does
so separately from the mechanism for the satisfaction of third party claims which exists
under Article 32(1)(a) and (b). Where Article 32(1)(a) and 32(2) are both engaged, a third
party's claim against the trustee can be satisfied from the trust fund up to the value of the
trust assets irrespective of whether the trustee is liable to the beneficiary for breach of trust.
Where Article 32(1)(b) and (2) are both engaged and the trustee has incurred liability to
the third party in breach of his duties as trustee, or is otherwise alleged to be in breach of
trust, the trustee is still entitled to have his indemnity satisfied in order to meet the third
party's claim. In other words, a third party that contracts with a trustee not knowing it to
be a trustee is entitled to satisfaction of its claim via the trustee's indemnity so long as there
are trust assets, irrespective of whether the trustee, in contracting with the third party, has
done so in breach of trust. Even where the trustee's liability extends to its personal assets
under Article 32(1)(b) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, so long as there are sufficient trust
assets to satisfy the claim, a creditor may not be prevented from having his claim satisfied by
the trustee (including by subrogation to the contracting trustee's right of indemnity) even
though the contracting trustee may have acted in breach of trust in assuming the obligation
or otherwise. This is a significant departure from the prevailing position under English law
where the rule is that a trustee who is in default of their duties to the fund is not permitted
to have recourse to its indemnity.28 The rule in Re Johnson29 prejudices a third party dealing with the trustee to the extent that the trustee is unable to have recourse to the trust's
assets; however, under English law, the trustee remains personally liable to the full extent
of its personal assets. It therefore has the effect of putting the trustee on risk to ensure they
do not forget their duties to the beneficiaries (or do so at their own risk) when dealing with
a third party. The effect of Article 32 is to prevent a third party dealing with the trustee of
Jersey trust from having recourse to the trustee's personal assets, with recourse limited only
to the trust's assets via the trustee's indemnity. Were the rule in Re Johnson to apply alongside Article 32, the third party would be unable to have recourse to the trust assets through
the trustee's indemnity and the trustee would have no personal liability to satisfy the third
party from its own assets. The conclusion of the Guernsey Court of Appeal in Glenalla30
is the logical consequence of the policy decision to protect the interests of third parties
dealing with a Jersey trustee. However it also has the consequence (perhaps unintended) of
protecting the trustee from what would otherwise be the ordinary consequence of being in
default of duty. The risk of a Jersey trustee contracting with a third party is borne not by
the trustee but by the beneficiaries. It has to be considered whether this result is justifiable
as a matter of principle or whether it is just a tolerable compromise balancing the interests
of third parties and beneficiaries. Where the trustee has breached its duties the beneficiaries
will have to be content with a separate breach of trust claim against the trustee to recover
the amount paid out to the third party creditor. However, the beneficiaries may find (particularly if the trustee is a Private Trust Company (PTC))31 that the trustee has insufficient
assets to restore the trust fund.

The Trustee's Indemnity

III. Common Liabilities of Trustees
A. Contracts
11-17

11-18

A Jersey trustee entering into a contract will be personally liable under the contract like
any other party to a contract. Subject to any contractual limitation on the trustee's liability
and the effect of Article 32 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 where the counterparty knows
the trustee is acting as trustee, the trustee's liability will be unlimited. Notwithstanding the
statutory provision for limited liability a Jersey trustee, if well advised, will usually seek to
limit its liability under the contract to a specific amount or to the extent of the trust fund.
Whether a Jersey trustee's liability is limited under a contract is a matter of construction of
the agreement to be determined by reference to all the circumstances. Where the contract is
governed by Jersey law, whether or not with a Jersey counterparty, the contract is likely to be
construed consistently with Article 32 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, with the result that
the trustee's liability will, if Article 32(1)(a) is engaged, be limited.32 Where the contract is
governed by a law other than the law of Jersey the position becomes more complicated. If
the contract comes to be enforced in a court outside Jersey, the question as to whether the
trustee's liability is limited depends upon how the nature and extent of the trustee's liability
is determined under the prevailing basic principles of the conflict of laws.33
It appears that a Jersey trust is to be considered as analogous to a company, whereby the
limited liability of the members of the company to a third party with whom the company
transacts is governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation rather than the law governing the transaction.34 If the law of one jurisdiction makes provision regarding the potential liability of a legal person holding a particular status then that, if it is of a substantive
nature, should be recognised by the courts of the forum of the dispute (assuming the forum
of the dispute recognises a trust at all).35 Under the law of Jersey, Article 32 is a substantive and not a procedural limitation on the trustee's liability.36 The alternative proposition,
which did not find favour with the Guernsey Court of Appeal in Glenalla is that it is the law

trust or trusts; (2) that does not solicit from or provide trust company business services to the public; and (3) the
administration of which is carried out by a registered person (who will often serve as a director) registered to carry
out trust company business. While a PTC does not have any exemptions from the obligations of trustees under
Jersey law, the PTC itself is not directly bound by the Codes of Practice for Trust Company Business issued under
the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998, Art 19, including the requirement for the PTC (which is not itself a registered person) to maintain professional indemnity insurance. Very often a PTC will effectively be a shell company.

governing the transaction in which the trustee is engaged that governs the limitation on the
liability of the trustee to that transaction. Where the proper law of the transaction is not
Jersey law, therefore, the trustee's liability would not be limited by Article 32.
Whether a third party knows they are dealing with a trustee is a matter of fact in each case.
It is thought not to be sufficient that a trustee is able to limit its liability under Article 32
merely by describing itself as a trustee (particularly given that an understanding of Article
32 cannot be assumed to exist on the part of a third party dealing with a trustee from outside the Channel Islands). However, a statement that the trustee is a trustee37 and is entering
into the contract qua trustee is an important part of the surrounding factual matrix that
can be taken into account by a court in construing the contract.38 A trustee that expressly
contracts 'as trustee but not otherwise' or 'as trustee only' may be sufficient as it is likely to
put a third party on notice to inquire as to what that means, which will give the trustee (as
it will be in its interests to do) an opportunity to explain the position.

11-19

B. Tortious Liabilities
A trustee may, like any other legal person, be liable in tort to a third party in respect of acts
or omissions by itself or its agents for which it is vicariously liable in connection with the
administration of the trust property. As between the trustee and the third party, there is no
reason why the trustee's liability should have anything to do with whether the trustee was
acting in accordance with its powers or duties qua trustee, which is an issue internal to the
trust. There is, as yet, no authority on the application of Article 32 of the Trusts (Jersey)
Law 1984 to a situation where the trustee is liable in tort to a third party. It is likely that in
the majority of cases the liability of a trustee in tort will be governed by Article 32(1)(b)
rather than Article 32(1)(a). There is no necessary reason why a third party would even
know the identity of a trustee when the cause of action is constituted, let alone that the
trustee is acting as a trustee. The trustee will be entitled to its indemnity from the trust
fund to satisfy a tortious liability to a third party if the trustee acted reasonably, with due
diligence in accordance with its powers as trustee.39 There is Australian authority that a
trustee is entitled to its indemnity from the trust fund for liabilities incurred by it in the
course of trade authorised by the terms of the trust even if the trustee is personally at fault,
provided the fault does not amount to fraud or a crime.40 For the same position to be
taken in Jersey would require the Court to reconcile the English authority providing for
indemnity only in the case of liabilities incurred reasonably, with due diligence as described
above. It would also likely require further exploration of whether, as the Court of Appeal
identified in Alhamrani v Alhamrani,41 there is a material difference in the scope of the

The Trustee's Indemnity

from Article 26(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.

C. Fiscal Liabilities
11-21

There is no doubt that a Jersey resident trustee is entitled to be indemnified out of the trust
property in respect of tax imposed upon a trustee by Jersey law. Where a Jersey resident
trustee is liable for a foreign tax liability, is payment of that tax by the trustee from within
the scope of the indemnity? The Royal Court has historically set its face against the direct
or indirect enforcement of foreign tax liabilities in Jersey under the principles in Government of Indian v Taylor.42 Generally, a Jersey trustee is not (whether or not in the absence
of a specific power in the trust instrument) entitled or bound to pay foreign fiscal impositions or to remit trust assets to a foreign jurisdiction for the purposes of satisfying a foreign
fiscal liability.43 The issue so far as the indemnity goes is whether the Government of India
principle means that if the trustee does pay a foreign revenue claim that is a liability reasonably incurred by the trustee in the execution of the trust so as to fall within the scope of
the indemnity. An express power to pay unenforceable foreign revenue claims is still in the
nature of a fiduciary power and so must be exercised for the purpose of giving proper effect
to the terms of the trust and the protection of the beneficiaries.44 The author is doubtful
whether such a power adds very much to the analysis of the trustee's position under the
general law, although the Court will have due regard to the presence of such a power in a
trust instrument if the trustee seeks directions.45 A trustee should apply for directions and
an order for indemnification under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 when faced
with a dilemma as to whether or not to pay a foreign revenue claim, whether or not it is
authorised to do so under the terms of the trust instrument. In considering an application
by the trustee to approve the payment of a foreign revenue claim, the Court is likely to have
close regard to the following:
1.

whether the revenue claim is enforceable against the trustee in the foreign country, or
failure to pay the revenue claim would entail the trustee breaching the law of a foreign
country in which the trustee is resident;
whether trust assets are situated in the jurisdiction where the foreign revenue claim
arises so as to be vulnerable to enforcement by local revenue authorities if the tax were
to go unpaid (as well as interest and penalties); and46
whether it is part of the terms of the trust that a beneficiary should receive trust property free of any tax that would arise in the jurisdiction where the beneficiary is resident,
and so were the trustee not to pay the tax the terms of the trust could not properly be
given effect to.47

D. Costs Incurred by an Incoming Trustee
The costs incurred by an incoming trustee in its 'take on' of trusteeship, undertaking the
necessary due diligence in compliance with its regulatory obligations and in familiarising
itself with the state of the trust and the costs associated with the appointment (whether
by the Court by the exercise of a power of appointment by the incumbent trustee), are
payable by way of an indemnity out of the trust fund.48

11-22

E. Litigation Costs
In the context of litigation between the trustee and a third party to the trust, the incidence
of costs in the proceedings is a separate issue from whether the trustee is permitted to reimburse itself for those costs from the trust fund. The first issue is external to the trust and
is governed by the normal rules of civil procedure while the latter issue is wholly internal
to the trust and falls within the ambit of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction in respect of
the internal workings of the trust. The trustee's entitlement to obtain an order, known as a
Beddoe order, for its own costs and any adverse cost risk incurred in the course of legal proceedings of any kind, is dealt with in Chapter 3. However, the trustee's entitlement to seek
an indemnity from the trust assets does have the potential to impact on the trustee's liability
for costs in hostile proceedings in which the trustee is engaged. First, where the litigation is
between the trustee and an 'insider' to the trust relationship, other than where the trustee is
sued for breach of trust. Secondly, where the third party with whom the trustee is in dispute
knows the trustee is acting as a trustee so as to cap the trustee's liability in costs to the third
party to the value of the trust assets.

i. Costs of Trust Proceedings
The treatment of litigation costs incurred in the course of trust proceedings49 is dealt with
elsewhere.50

11-24

ii. Costs of Proceedings against the Trust or the Trust Property
A second category of legal proceeding in which the trustee's right of indemnity becomes
engaged is where a third party, by way of hostile proceedings issued against the trustee, lays claim to the whole or part of the trust fund. There are a number of circumstances in which a third party may lay claim to a proprietary interest in the trust assets
(rather than a mere personal claim against the trustee, which is considered below). The
claim may be made by the settlor or by others through the settlor, seeking to set aside
the disposition of property into trust on the grounds of an operative mistake,51 or on the
48

Harvey v Oliver (1887) 57 LT 239.

The Trustee's Indemnity

grounds that the disposition is a transaction in fraud of the settlor's creditors.52 An alternative basis upon which a third party may assert a proprietary entitlement to the trust
assets is where the assets are already subject to a prior equitable interest that has not been
extinguished because the property has been stolen or misappropriated by a fiduciary.53
If such a claim is successful it has the effect of upending the basis upon which the trustee holds the trust property. The nature of the claim against the trust assets is to place
the trustee's interests and the third party's interests in direct conflict in respect of the
trustee's indemnity. Were the trustee to seek to have recourse to the trust assets by way of
its indemnity for the legal costs of defending the trust assets from a proprietary claim, the
trustee would, in effect, be using the third party's money to defeat the third party's vindication of its proprietary rights. The prejudice that arises to the third party is similar to that
arising in circumstances where the trustee is able to plead its limited liability to the third
party as a defence to the main action and there are insufficient trust assets to satisfy both
the main action and the costs of the proceedings, where there has to be an abatement of
the claim.54 The risk to the trustee in defending hostile proceedings by which a third party
lays claim to the trust assets is that, if successful, the substratum of the trust has been totally
undermined and there will be no trust assets to which the trustee's indemnity may attach in
satisfaction of the trustee's costs.
The key applicable principle in this situation is that the trustee cannot usually hope to
maintain its right to an indemnity against a plaintiff that is successful in pursuing a proprietary claim. The best the trustee can hope for is either a direction not to defend the claim
or to persuade the Court to exercise its discretion as to costs under Article 53 of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984 in the trustee's favour. If the trustee acts reasonably, which in the absence
of an express direction to the contrary means neutrally, the established presumption is that
the trustee will be allowed its costs from the fund by way of its indemnity. This position is
justifiable on the basis that while the beneficial interest in the trust assets shifts from the
named beneficiaries in favour of the plaintiff asserting its beneficial interest in their place,
the assets are still held on trust for someone. The position is therefore analogous to the
established presumption in Buckton category 1 cases55 where the dispute is one of construction as to the terms upon which the trustee holds the assets.
While it may suit the trustee's personal interests to remain neutral, until the claim is determined in favour of the third party the trustee still owes the named beneficiaries a duty to
protect and preserve the trust fund which the trustee cannot discharge if it, of its own volition, assumes a neutral position. Indeed the trustee's neutrality may result in the third party
winning where it might otherwise have lost its claim had the trustee defended the claim.
Caught on the horns of this kind of dilemma the trustee has very few alternatives other than
to make a Beddoe application.

52 Note that any attack upon the original disposition of assets into trust is protected by the firewall and is
subject to Art 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.
53 See Ch 6 as to the basis upon which a proprietary constructive trust may arise.
54 No such issue arises where Art 32(1)(a) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 is not engaged. As to which see para
11-40 below.
55 See Ch 3.

Common Liabilities of Trustees

431

The trustee's neutrality may be a sustainable position where there is a beneficiary or group
of beneficiaries willing and able to defend the trust fund at their own cost risk instead of the
trustee.56 In this kind of dispute the real dispute is between those with a competing interest
in the beneficial entitlement to the fund, making the proceedings analogous with a Buckton
category 3 claim,57 where the established position is that a trustee is normally entitled to its
costs of proceedings by way of its indemnity while the real combatants battle it out, usually
on the basis that costs follow the event. This assumes there is an adult beneficiary willing to
defend, which cannot be guaranteed. The beneficiaries may not be willing to subject themselves to the ordeal and cost risk of litigating on behalf of the trust fund and the third party
may, not unreasonably, seek to exploit the trustee's reluctance to wholeheartedly defend the
third party's claim. Where assets are held on private purpose trusts there may not even be
beneficiaries at all capable of defending the main action.58
The trustee should explore the possibilities of funding the defence of the third party's claim
from another source (whether outside the trust or from trust assets that are unaffected by
the third party's claim). It is likely to be prudent for the trustee to seek the blessing of the
Court to an arrangement with a third party litigation funder (who will invariably require
a return for the promise of funding) where the return is likely to be met, whether in whole
or in part, from the trust fund in the event that the trustee succeeds in seeing off the third
party's claim. What is clear is that the trustee should not be tempted to allow the third
party's claim to go by default unless there is no real prospect of defending it.59
No Beddoe application will be necessary unless there is dissent among the beneficial class
as to what the trustee should do in response to the third party's claim (assuming there
are some trust assets available to fund a defence),60 or where there are minor, unborn or
unascertained beneficiaries whose interests are not otherwise represented but which will be
affected either way if the trustee defends using trust assets or the fund is declared to belong
to the third party.
A trustee who finds itself faced with a third party proprietary claim to the trust assets, and
where there is no ready source of external funding to defend the proceedings and/or no
beneficiary willing to put themselves forward to defend the claim at their own expense,
is, to put it mildly, in a dilemma and can usually expect a sympathetic ear from the Royal
Court in making a Beddoe application. In such an application, the Court is likely to have
regard to the principles governing prospective costs orders (if it does not absolve the trustee
of its responsibility to defend the claim). If the Court does direct the trustee to defend, the
Court will need to be persuaded as to the strength of the defence (which will have to have
a high prospect of success) but also as to why it is not an injustice upon the third party for
the Court to grant permission for the trustee to defend the case at the third party's expense.

56 As to derivative claims by beneficiaries, see Ch 13.
57

See Ch 3.
The position of an enforcer in such circumstances is unclear; it would presumably be in the same position as
the trustee in having no personal incentive to intervene and too much exposure if it chose to do so.
59 It would be a brave trustee that took this sort of momentous decision without seeking the Court's direction:
see the line of cases following Public Trustee v Cooper [2001] WTLR 901, approved in Jersey in In re S Settlement
[2001 JLR N [37]].
60 ie a Beddoe application is the only prudent course for the trustee unless the beneficiaries are unanimous in
their view as to what the trustee should do (assuming the defence can be funded).

432

The Trustee's Indemnity

It should not be forgotten that in a Beddoe hearing the Court has a wide discretion as to
what directions it gives and the choice is not a binary one between directing the trustee to
defend or to do nothing.61

iii. Costs of Third Party Proceedings
11-33

The third category of dispute where the trustee's right of indemnity from the fund arises is
where the trustee becomes involved in proceedings with an outsider to the trust in respect
of rights or liabilities assumed by the trustee during the course of the trustee's administration of the trust.62

11-34

It is the trustee, and not the beneficiaries, who represents the trust in proceedings with third
parties.63 In such proceedings, the trustee acts as the principal with conduct of the administration of the trust and has a duty to protect and preserve the trust fund in the interests
of the beneficiaries.64 Where, for example, the trustee becomes engaged in a legal dispute
with a counterparty with which it entered into a contract during the course of the trust's
administration, only the trustee will have privity of contract with the third party to appear
as plaintiff or defendant. The trustee will normally be the title holder to the trust property
and as such will be responsible for vindicating rights or answering for liabilities by virtue of
being the title holder. In tortious claims, it is likely to be the trustee to whom or by whom
duties are owed.
A trustee engaged in a third party legal dispute sits, Janus-like, upon a threshold. Outwardly,
as between the trustee and the third party with whom it is engaged in a dispute, the issue is
what order for costs, if any, should be made by the Court in disposing of the legal dispute.
The trustee has no special status as a litigant and is subject to the normal presumption
that costs follow the event. However, at the same time, the trustee faces inwardly, towards
its beneficiaries. As between the trustee and its beneficiaries, the issue is whether the costs
incurred by the trustee in the course of the third party proceedings (whether the trustee's
own costs or any adverse costs it is ordered to pay to the third party) fall to be satisfied
from the trust assets, pursuant to the trustee's indemnity for costs reasonably incurred, or
whether they fall to the trustee to satisfy personally from its own assets.

11-35

a. Position as between the Trustee and Third Party
11-36

The incidence of costs as between the trustee and the third party in a dispute litigated
outside Jersey is governed by the law of the forum of the dispute. Where the litigation is
conducted in Jersey, the incidence of costs will be governed by Jersey's procedural and substantive rules.65 The third party proceedings will usually be commenced either by way of
Order of Justice or summons in the Royal Court or Petty Debts Court, for disputes falling
with the latter's jurisdictional limits.66
61

See Ch 3.

63 Unless the beneficiaries have brought and obtained relief to bring a derivative claim on behalf of the trustee,
as to which see Ch 13. When granting leave for a derivative action, the Court can also normally be expected to
grant prospective costs relief; see In re X Trust [2012 (2) JLR 260].

Common Liabilities of Trustees

433

In normal hostile proceedings the Court has a discretion as to whether costs are payable
and their amount. Where the Court resolves to make an award of costs, the general rule is
that costs follow the event and that the unsuccessful party is ordered to pay the costs of the
successful party either on the standard or indemnity basis.67 Where therefore a trustee sues
or is sued by a third party to the trust and loses, the prima facie rule is that the trustee is
normally ordered to meet the third party's costs. Where the trustee is acting properly and
reasonably in either bringing or defending the claim (other than in circumstances where
losing the claim would exhaust the fund) then the trustee is usually entitled to recoup the
costs of the litigation from the trust fund as an expense reasonably incurred in the administration of the trust and thereby transferring the risk in the litigation from the trustee personally to the beneficiaries. Just as the trustee has no special or privileged status as a trustee
against the third party, a third party, if successful, will get its costs as if the trustee were any
other party in hostile proceedings.

11-37

b. Position as between the Trustee and the Beneficiaries
The key issue as between the trustee and the beneficiaries where the trustee engages in
hostile proceedings on behalf of the trust is whether the trustee is acting reasonably in
engaging in the litigation in the first place so as to preserve its indemnity under Article 26.
The trustee's right of indemnity as regards the costs of litigation operates as follows. If
the trustee is sued by a third party and successfully defends the action, the third party is
normally ordered to pay the trustee's costs. Whether an award is made on the standard or
indemnity basis, there is usually a shortfall between the amount the third party is ordered
to pay and the amount the trustee has actually spent. Even an award of indemnity costs is
not a full indemnity (so as to make the trustee 100 per cent whole). Where the indemnity is
preserved, the trustee is in principle permitted to make up the shortfall from the trust fund.
Where the trustee is subject to an adverse costs order in favour of the third party, the trustee
is entitled by way of its indemnity to be reimbursed those costs out of the trust fund, as well
as the whole of the costs which the trustee has itself incurred in the conduct of the proceedings. The mere fact that the trustee has engaged in litigation in which it has incurred
costs and been unsuccessful is not of itself a basis to preclude the trustee from getting reimbursement of its costs pursuant to its indemnity.68 Objectively the trustee may still have
acted reasonably. However, in the absence of the protection afforded by a Beddoe order in
advance of commencing hostile proceedings, it is likely only to be in exceptional circumstances that the trustee will be able to establish that it is still within the scope of Article 26.
Obtaining Beddoe relief has become very close to being a prerequisite to establishing that
the trustee's participation in hostile proceedings was reasonable for the purposes of Article
26. Where the trustee proceeds without Beddoe relief, the trustee runs a significant risk that
it will be denied its indemnity and will be required to meet the costs of hostile proceedings
from its own resources and/or face the prospect of a dispute with the beneficiaries if the
trustee attempts to recoup the costs of hostile proceedings without the Court's blessing.

Is an award of costs incurred in litigation subject to the statutory limitation upon the trustee's personal liability in Article 32(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984?69 If the third party
knows the trustee is a trustee, the answer appears to be in the affirmative. Litigation in
which a trustee becomes engaged is a 'matter' for the purposes of Article 32(1).70 An adverse
costs order made against a trustee in the course of litigation is not made against the trustee
in its personal capacity but qua trustee and therefore, whether or not the trust assets are
insufficient to meet any award, the trustee is not liable to satisfy an adverse costs order from
its own assets. Trustees may be involved in a variety of different types of litigation.71 The
Article 32 limitation will only be engaged in litigation in which the trustee would be entitled to an indemnity for its costs from the trust fund.72 As the Guernsey Court of Appeal
observes, this conclusion ensures consistency between the rights of a third party engaged in
litigation against the trustee and any other counterparty to any other kind of transaction or
matter with a trustee. However, this conclusion has serious implications for a trustee's attitude to risk when engaging in litigation against third parties on behalf of the trust. Other
than the possibility of a claim by the beneficiaries against the trustee for breach of trust in
having burdened (or perhaps even exhausted) the trust fund by incurring an adverse costs
award, the fact that the trustee is not personally at risk as to costs means there may be no
incentive for the trustee to obtain Beddoe relief.

IV. Mechanism for Satisfaction of the Trustee's
Right of Indemnity
11-40

While it had been the subject of doubt,73 the Royal Court has now confirmed that in support
of its right of indemnity a trustee has an equitable lien over the trust fund in the nature of a
proprietary interest in respect of all liabilities, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in the discharge of its office.74 The trustee's lien comprises a number of rights: reimbursement from the trust property, retention of the trust assets and realisation of the trust
assets and exoneration in respect of liabilities. The trustee's lien takes priority to the claims of
the beneficiaries to the trust property.75 A former trustee is entitled to ensure that successor
trustees do not take steps that will destroy, diminish or jeopardise that right.76

Mechanism for Satisfaction of the Indemnity

435

A trustee is entitled to meet a liability reasonably incurred from its own resources, and
then reach into the fund for assets of commensurate value to make itself whole. More commonly, the trustee will not meet the liability directly but will satisfy it directly from the
fund. A trustee may retain (by way of escrow) sufficient trust assets from the fund to the
extent required to meet liabilities reasonably incurred. The reasonableness of a trustee's
right of retention will depend upon the circumstances.77 The practical impact of retaining
trust assets on the smooth administration of the trust (the assets not being available for the
benefit of beneficiaries) usually means the trustee's retention of assets is only considered
reasonable in cases involving present liabilities of the trustee (such as fees),78 liabilities that
are very likely or certain to fall due in the foreseeable future on the basis of a reasonable
not fanciful assumption,79 or in cases where there is a foreseeable risk that the trust assets
will not be available to meet the liability when it falls due. It is inappropriate for the trustee
to seek to retain the whole or any substantial portion of the trust fund in satisfaction of
disputed fees.80 Where the trustee does seek to exercise its right to retain trust assets, the
trustee should be prepared to satisfy the Court that it has made proper inquiries as to what
contingent or future liabilities there are and the extent of the trustee's potential liability.81
A trustee is entitled to realise trust assets to generate cash to meet its costs and expenses even
if a sale is against the wishes of the beneficiaries or the asset is required or lived in by the
beneficiary.82 The Court is unlikely to subordinate the trustee's entitlement to its indemnity
(even if that means a realisation of the trust's assets) to the rights of the beneficiaries. Where
the realisation involves the principal trust asset, the trustee is clearly conflicted in how it
exercises its power of sale and where there is resistance from the beneficiaries, the trustee
would be well advised to make an application for directions in respect of a momentous
decision.83
The trustee's lien extents over the whole of the trust fund, whether income or capital, and
a liability, whether chargeable to either capital or income, may be satisfied from any part of
it.84 Where there are distinct trust funds within the same trust, a trustee is generally entitled
to indemnify itself from funds held in one fund for liabilities incurred in respect of the
other.85 A trustee is not generally entitled to interest on sums it expends satisfying liabilities
on behalf of the trust from its own resources and then recovers from the fund by way of its
indemnity.86

The Trustee's Indemnity

A. Rights of Third Party Creditors of the Trustee to the Trust Fund
11-43

The unsecured creditors of the trustee (whether personal creditors or trust creditors) do
not have direct recourse to and may not seek to levy execution against the trust assets in
respect of liabilities incurred to them by the trustee.87 However, a creditor of the trustee
may be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity to enforce its entitlement against the
trust assets in the same way as the trustee itself would be entitled. The third party creditor
stands in the shoes of the trustee and its rights cannot exceed the trustee's own entitlement
to have recourse to the trust assets. The Guernsey Court of Appeal's decision in Glenalla
to the effect that Jersey law does not admit of the rule in Re Johnson88 means that the third
party creditor may still be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity even where the
trustee is alleged to be in breach of trust.89

i. Where a Third Party Claim May Exhaust the Trust Fund
11-44

Particular thought needs to be given to the incidence of costs in circumstances where the
trustee is faced with a claim which, if successful, will exhaust the entire trust fund or where
recourse to the indemnity leaves the trust insolvent on the cash-flow basis.90 There is a
distinction between a proprietary claim (already considered) and a personal claim by a
third party against the trustee. Where there is an insufficiency in the trust assets, the benefit
that would normally accrue to the trustee in obtaining Beddoe relief may be illusory if the
means by which the trustee is able to pay its legal costs or an adverse costs order is exhausted
by the quantum of the main claim.
a. Third Party Claims against the Trustee where the Trustee's Liability is Limited

11-45

Where a trustee is faced with a personal claim by a third party and the third party knew
it was dealing with the trustee qua trustee, the third party's recourse against the trustee in
satisfaction of its personal claim is limited to the value of the trust assets. This means the
trust assets net of any deductions for the trustee's reasonable expenses, including any legal
costs (both the trustee's own costs and any adverse costs it may be ordered to pay the third
party) reasonably incurred by the trustee in defending any claim.91 In order for the trustee
to ensure that no dispute arises as between itself and the third party as to whether the trustee's legal costs are reasonably incurred, the trustee is usually well advised to obtain Beddoe
relief to put the matter beyond doubt. The liability of the trustee to meet its own lawyer's
fees is not usually in issue, as the lawyers will know they are dealing with a trustee and so the
trustee's liability under the retainer will be within the scope of Article 32(1)(a).

Insolvency and the Trustee's Indemnity

437

b. Third Party Claims against the Trustee where the Trustee Does not Have the Benefit of
Limited Liability
In contrast to the position where Article 32(1)(a) is engaged, when a trustee is faced with
a personal claim by a third party and the third party did not know it was dealing with the
trustee qua trustee, the third party's recourse against the trustee in satisfaction of its personal claim (including any adverse costs) is unlimited92 even though, as between the trustee
and the beneficiaries, the trustee may be entitled to its indemnity for its legal costs from
the trust fund if they are reasonably incurred. In circumstances where the trust assets may
be exhausted by a combination of the trustee's own legal costs, the sum sought in satisfaction of the main claim or the adverse costs ordered to be paid by the trustee to the third
party, a Beddoe application will usually provide the trustee with the protection it requires.
A trustee will not be expected to litigate on behalf of the trust at its own expense, where
the trust fund is insufficient to be able to bear the trustee's costs of doing so and there is no
other lawful funding mechanism available to protect the trustee from the risk of having to
expend its own funds in defence of the trust. The trustee's duty in this regard is therefore
commensurate with the trustee's right of indemnity. The only exception to this principle is
where the insufficiency in the trust fund arises from the trustee's own mismanagement or
breach of duty.

11-46

V. Insolvency and the Trustee's Indemnity
In recent years the courts of both Jersey and neighbouring Guernsey have begun to explore
the boundary between principles of trust law and principles of insolvency law. When considering the interaction between insolvency law and trust law it is important to distinguish
between, on the one hand, the insolvency of the legal persons that constitute the trust: the
trustee, the settlor, the beneficiaries, perhaps a corporation that is owned by the trustee; and
on the other hand (if such a thing can be said to exist at all) the insolvency of the trust as a
thing distinct from the trustee.

11-47

A. The Insolvency of the Trustee
It is beyond the scope of this text to provide a detailed statement of Jersey's insolvency
law.93 While a trust may not become insolvent,94 the legal person of the trustee, whether
natural or legal can. The effect of Article 32(1)(a) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 is to make
it legally impossible to make the trustee, qua trustee, insolvent. There are two principal
regimes applicable to an insolvent corporate trustee in Jersey: désastre and winding up.
A désastre is conducted in accordance with the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990.

92

Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 32(1)(b); see para 11-15 above.

438

The Trustee's Indemnity

The winding up of a corporate trustee (which does not necessary require the trustee to be
insolvent) is conducted in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. A creditor's
only remedy against a corporate trustee is to place the trustee en désastre. A creditors' winding up is something of a misnomer as the procedure to appoint a liquidator can only be
commenced by a resolution of the members of the corporate trustee and not by the trustee's creditors. The Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) can seek that a corporate
trustee be declared en désastre. The purpose of both the désastre and creditors' winding up
procedure is to effect a pari passu distribution of the trustee's assets amongst its creditors
according to their status.

B. The Test for Insolvency
11-49

The test for the personal insolvency of a corporate trustee, both in the case of a désastre and
to commence the process of a creditor's winding up, is the cash-flow test: that the trustee is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due.95 However even where a corporate trustee is insolvent, whether to make declaration that the corporate trustee is en désastre remains within
the discretion of the Royal Court.

C. Effect of a Declaration of désastre
11-50

Upon the making of a declaration that the personal property of the trustee is en désastre, the
property of the corporate trustee, whether movable or immovable, present, future, vested
or contingent and whether located in or outside of Jersey and the powers of the directors,
vests in the Viscount.

D. Winding up a Corporate Trustee
11-51

A creditors' winding up commences upon the passing of the special resolution by the company's members in general meeting. The subsequently convened meeting of the company's
creditors will approve the appointment of a liquidator. Unlike in a désastre, in a winding up,
the property of the trustee remains vested in the corporate trustee. The liquidator stands in
the shoes of the directors and acts as agent of the corporate trustee.

E. Effect of the Insolvency of the Trustee on Trusteeship and the
Trust Fund
11-52

Upon the declaration that the trustee is en désastre or the commencement of a creditors'
wining up, there is a general moratorium of claims against the trustee while the process is
concluded, ending in the dissolution of the corporate trustee.96 Subject to the ­particular

terms of a trust, which may provide for automatic renunciation of office upon the insolvency of the trustee,97 or the suspension of the trustee's powers other than the power to
appoint its successor and then retire, the insolvency of the trustee does not operate to
terminate the trusteeship automatically.98 However, in practice, a professional trustee can
normally be expected to retire and transfer trusteeship well in advance of it becoming
insolvent on the cash-flow basis. Such are the internal financial control systems required of
registered persons providing services as professional trustees by the JFSC that the prospect
of the trustee's insolvency will usually trigger the intervention of the JFSC and its insistence that the trustee immediately arrange for the transfer of trusteeship and assets to a new
service provider.
Other provisions of Jersey's insolvency regime positively incentivise the directors of a corporate trustee to transfer trusteeship at the earliest opportunity where insolvency may be
a possibility. A regulated person offering services as a professional trustee is trading for the
purposes of Article 177 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 44 of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990. Under these provisions, the directors of a corporate
trustee may be held personally liable, without any limitation, for all or any of the debts
or other personal liabilities of the trustee if at a time before the declaration of désastre or
the date of commencement of a winding up of the trustee the director knew there was no
reasonable prospect that the company would avoid, or was reckless as to whether the company would avoid, such a winding up or the making of such a declaration of désastre, and
continued to allow the corporate trustee to trade.
It is an offence for any person to carry on trust company business (which includes acting
as a professional trustee) without a licence from the JFSC.99 The JFSC may revoke a licence
to conduct trust company business if the Commission is not satisfied that the applicant
is a fit and proper person to be registered, having regard to its financial standing.100 The
personal insolvency of the trustee is likely to make it practically impossible for the trustee
to continue to act as trustee.
Where the trustee (whether corporate or individual) becomes insolvent or declared en
désastre, only the trustee's own personal assets will fall into the bankruptcy.101 Those assets
held by the trustee qua trustee will not.102 It follows that property held by a debtor trustee
on trust will not vest in the Viscount but will remain vested in the trustee.
Article 54(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides that trust assets will not be deemed
to form part of the estate of a trustee unless the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust. That
must be taken as requiring the beneficial interest of the trustee to be a vested interest as a
beneficiary who is an object of a discretionary power of appointment under a discretionary
trust cannot be said, in advance of the exercise of that power of appointment to it, to have
any interest in the property of the trust that is capable of forming part of the beneficiary's
personal estate.103

The Trustee's Indemnity

If the trustee does not fall within Article 54(2) then the interest the trustee has in the trust
property is limited to that which is necessary for the proper performance of the trust.104
That is a reference to the trustee's right of indemnity against the fund.105 A trustee's creditors have no right or claim against the trust property except to the extent that the trustee has
a claim against the trust (by way of subrogation to the trustee's indemnity) or has a vested
beneficial interest in some portion of the trust property. Even in those circumstances, the
trustee's creditors' claim will be limited to the extent of the indemnity or the trustee's interest in the trust fund.
If the assets of the trust fund are insufficient to satisfy the liability that is sought to be
enforced against the trustee so as to exhaust the assets which can be subject to the trustee's
indemnity, or the indemnity cannot be relied upon,106 then as a matter of orthodox trust
law principles the trustee remains personally liable to the third party to the full extent of its
personal assets. Unlike in English law, a trustee of a Jersey trust has protection of limited
liability (limited to the extent of the trust fund) if the third party with whom the trustee incurs the liability knows it is dealing with a trustee. If the requirements of Article 32
are satisfied, the third party will have no recourse to the personal assets of the trustee in
the event of a shortfall in the trust fund or if the trustee's right of indemnity is somehow
compromised.
The combined effect of these provisions is that it is legally impossible for a Jersey trustee,
qua trustee, to be made insolvent. None of the trust property forms part of the trustee's own
bankrupt estate and the effect of Article 32 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, at least where
a third party knows that it is dealing with a trustee, is that the trustee's liability to the third
party cannot extend beyond the value of the trust fund.

F. Costs and Expenses of the Trustee's Insolvency
11-60

If the trustee is declared en désastre the Viscount's fees, costs and expenses properly incurred
are paid as a first charge on the liquidated value of the trustee's own assets. The payment of
the costs, charges and expenses of winding up, including the remuneration of the liquidator, are payable out of the company's assets in priority to all other claims.107 Neither the
Viscount nor a liquidator in a creditors' winding up is entitled to have recourse to the trust
fund by way of the trustee's indemnity for the costs of the désastre or winding up unless
the trustee has expended its own resources meeting a liability to a third party on behalf
of the trust and has not reimbursed itself from the fund prior to the declaration or the
­commencement of the winding up.

441

G. The Effect of the Trustee's Insolvency on the Trust Property and the
Administration of the Trusts
Upon the making of a declaration that the personal property of the trustee is en désastre, all
property (whether located in Jersey or elsewhere) and powers of the debtor trustee vest in
the Viscount.108 Property held by the debtor trustee that is subject to a trust does not vest
in the Viscount and, to the extent that it has not already been transferred, remains vested in
the trustee.109 As for trust assets that are converted into property of a different character or
mixed with other property, the beneficiaries will ordinarily be entitled to trace it into them
and assert proprietary remedies, which are not dependent upon the trustee's insolvency.
A third party proprietary interest in property held by the trustee renders the property unavailable to an insolvent trustee's personal creditors. It follows that in the absence of circumstances that may cause the Viscount to question whether a trust exists or not,110 the trust
property is not touched by the debtor trustee's personal insolvency. In a creditors' winding
up both the personal property of the trustee and any property that it still holds on trust and
has not yet transferred to a new trustee remain vested in the trustee and not the liquidator.
In practice, the existence of an express trust vested in the trustee, if it has not already been
transferred to a new trustee well in advance of the declaration, is unlikely to cause significant difficulty. The position is likely to be more complicated, and may require the Viscount
or liquidator to obtain the direction or determination of the Court, where property vested
in a debtor is subject to a trust that has arisen informally or by operation of law. Whether
under a specific direction from the Court or under its own volition, it can be expected that
the Viscount (or the liquidator in a winding up) will arrange for the transfer of the trusteeship and the vesting of trust assets in a new trustee as soon as is practicable after the existence of the trust is brought to his attention.
The powers of the Viscount expressly include the power to conduct the business of the
debtor (which could conceivably include acting as a trustee) but only in so far as this is necessary or expedient in the interests of creditors.111 In a creditors' winding up, all the powers
of the directors of the debtor company become exercisable by the liquidator.112 Given that
the trust property does not form part of the trustee's désastre or liquidation and so may not
be made available to the trustee's personal creditors, it is unlikely the Viscount has power to
continue to administer a trust of which the debtor is the trustee. Practically, the Viscount's
function is to conduct the désastre and he will have little appetite to assume the duties or
functions of a trustee.
The trustee's indemnity is not a mechanism to pay for the costs and expenses of the
Viscount or the liquidator of the trustee. While the costs of the Viscount or liquidator

administering the trust would be properly chargeable to the trust fund, the costs of a
désastre or liquidation are not costs properly incurred in the administration of the trust and
therefore are not recoverable under Article 26 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.113

VI. Insolvent Trusts
11-65

A trust is a legal relationship comprised of rights and obligations. A trust is not a juridical
person and therefore cannot be made insolvent or declared en désastre.114 However, the
effect of Article 32 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 allows for the possibility of what is in
effect and can be described as, at least as a convenient shorthand, an insolvent trust, independent of the personal solvency of the trustee. Where the trustee perceives there to be a
probability that the trust is insolvent, that will bring about realignment of how the trust is
administered and for whom. The interests of the beneficiaries in the fund are displaced and
replaced by the interests of creditors. Thereafter the powers and duties of the trustee (and
any third party such as a protector)115 are to be exercised with the consent of and in the
interests of all the creditors as a class (or in accordance with the directions of the Court) to
the exclusion of the interests of the beneficiaries.116

A. Test for Insolvency of a Trust
11-66

11-67

The relevant test for the insolvency of a Jersey trust is the cash-flow rather than the balance
sheet test of insolvency: the inability of the trustee to meet its debts as they fall due from the
trust property.117 The solvency of a trust is, it appears, judged according to the prevailing
test in Jersey insolvency law applicable to individuals or companies in the ongoing conduct
of their business, and not with the estate of a deceased person, where the balance sheet test
for insolvency is often invoked.118
The cash-flow test of insolvency is not without its conceptual and practical difficulties. A
trust is neither a legal nor a natural person and while a Jersey trust may exist for a noncharitable purpose,119 it cannot accurately be said that a trust conducts business in the

113 The Court retains an inherent power to authorise the remuneration of a trustee qua liquidator of an insolvent trust, as to which see 11-71 below. The creditors of an insolvent trust may also authorise the remuneration
of a trustee acting as liquidator.
114 Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, Art 1 defines debtor as a person. For different reasons, a trust cannot be subject to a degrévèment by virtue of the statutory prohibition on Jersey land being held on trust by trustee;
see Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 11(2)(a)(iii). If a trustee is to hold Jersey immovable property it may only do so
indirectly, through a corporation.

same way that an individual or corporation might. Where a trust owns all the shares in a
trading company, it is the company rather than the trust that conducts the business. Indeed
a trustee with the benefit of an anti-Bartlett clause may have no active involvement in the
management or business of an underlying company at all. The obvious practical difficulty
for a trustee of a cash-flow insolvent trust is that a cash-flow difficulty may only be a temporary problem, giving rise to the practical difficulty of the trustee's duties and powers
oscillating unpredictably back and forth between the interests of beneficiaries and creditors. The precise threshold at which a trustee is supposed to realise that its trust is insolvent
is inexact,120 particularly when considering the serious implications that insolvency might
have itself on those of its employees appointed to the boards of companies whose shares are
held by the trust.121
The cash-flow test for the insolvency of a trust also has significant implications for the asset
composition of a Jersey trust structure. A trust that contains many millions of pounds of
illiquid assets, such as land, and which on any sensible interpretation could not properly be
regarded as being at risk of insolvency, could find itself at risk of liquidation for an unpaid
electricity bill well within the upper limit for debts within the jurisdiction of the Petty
Debts Court.122

11-68

B. Winding up an Insolvent Trust
There is as yet no formalised statutory regime to wind up an insolvent trust in Jersey. Given
the re-orientation of the focus of the trustee's powers123 and duties from beneficiaries to
creditors that occurs as soon as the trust becomes insolvent, and in the absence of a default
statutory insolvency regime that may be followed, it is imperative that the trustee issue a
Representation for directions under Article 51(2)(a)(i)-(ii) as soon as it perceives there
to be a risk that the trust is no longer solvent. The Court has drawn inspiration from the

The regime that was approved by the Royal Court in Re Hickman was itself based on the
regime applicable to a désastre under Bankruptcy (Désastre) Rules 2006 notwithstanding
that under Jersey's insolvency law it is not possible to have an insolvent estate made the
subject of a désastre; the deceased's estate must be administered pursuant to the common

also confirms that powers must be exercised in the interests of the trust to which the powers relate and cannot be
exercised for the benefit of another trust in a related structure, even though it may be convenient to do so for the

A notice published requiring creditors to file their claims within a specified date.
Failure to file a claim by that date will lead to forfeiture of a creditor's right to participate in the distribution from the trust.
Creditors will be able to inspect claims and file oppositions.
The trustee will examine the claims and any oppositions and either admit or reject the
same.
A creditor dissatisfied with the decision of the executor to either reject a claim or opposition to a claim can apply to have the decision reviewed by the Court.
Following determination of the claims the trustee will serve the draft accounts on the
creditors and apply to court for the accounts to be approved and the realised assets
distributed.

The Re Hickman directions envisage an insolvent liquidation of the remaining assets of the
trust fund. However, the Royal Court has stated that the insolvency regime adopted in Re
Hickman will not be appropriate in all cases.126 The Court is alive to the need to maintain
flexibility in whatever insolvency regime will be the interests of creditors as a body. While
the directions, or something very like them, that were given in Re Hickman may be appropriate in a case where the trustee faces numerous claims from third party creditors all pressing for their claims to be paid and the trust assets realised, by contrast in a case such as in
the Z Trust s litigation,127 where the creditors are in both number and value connected, and
they oppose the imposition of an insolvency regime that would risk the destruction of value
in the assets were they to be realised, the Court can and will take a different approach. The
Z Trusts decisions demonstrate that it is far from clear whether the answer in every case (to
what may be a temporary cash-flow problem for the trust) is liquidation or whether there
is some other course the Court should consider and give directions accordingly. A further
question arises as to whether the incumbent trustee should remain in office to administer
the trust through whatever course is deemed appropriate in the interest of the trust's creditors. If the trust is to be liquidated, should the incumbent trustee remain in office or resign
in favour of a professional liquidator, who might have greater experience of the insolvency
process? Whoever administers the trust from the moment of its insolvency, how are they
to be paid?

C. The Office Holder
11-71

It has been observed that the position of an executor of an insolvent estate and a trustee
of an insolvent trust are not directly analogous.128 In the context of an insolvent estate,

125 Bankruptcy (Désastre)(Jersey) Law 1990, Art 4(2) provides that no application can be made to have an
insolvent estate made the subject of a 'désastre' which must be administered pursuant to the common law and to
the Probate (Jersey) Law 1998. It is not possible to make a trust the subject of a désastre.

the debts incurred to third parties will have been by the deceased. In the context of a trust,
unless a new office holder is appointed to conduct the insolvency process, the debts will
have been incurred by the trustee. On orthodox English trust law principles, there is an
inherent conflict in a trustee undertaking the process of examining, admitting or rejecting
claims against itself. However, the effect of Article 32(1)(a) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
means that the potential for conflict that exists between the trustee's personal capacity and
its capacity qua trustee in settling claims does not exist. Once the trust enters insolvency, the
trustee becomes, in essence, a cipher through whom the claims of the creditors are made.
That will not apply to the trustee's own claim for professional fees and expenses, but that is
a conflict inherent of a professional trustee which (whether or not the trust is insolvent) is
manageable under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court.
Upon insolvency the trustee must administer the trust for the benefit of creditors as a whole,
and the interests of beneficiaries are displaced.129 Where the trustee remains in office, it will
do so to fulfil the function of a liquidator. The liquidation of the fund is not usually within
the scope of the remuneration provision in a trust instrument.130 The trustee must obtain
creditor agreement or Court approval for the charging of ongoing fees.131 Failure to do so
may mean that fees incurred beyond the point of insolvency might rank equal to, or perhaps even behind, the claims of other creditors.132

11-72

D. The Effect of the Trustee's Insolvency on the Trustee's Indemnity
The trustee's indemnity and lien are in the nature of an equitable proprietary interest over
the trust assets.133 In most cases the creditor's right of subrogation never arises because
the trustee is able to satisfy the liability from the trust's assets by way of its own indemnity.
A creditor is most likely to rely upon its right to be subrogated to the trustee's indemnity
in a case where the trustee or the trust becomes insolvent. Where the trustee as an entity
is declared en désastre, the trustee's right of indemnity vests in the Viscount. Where the
trustee is put into liquidation, the lien remains vested in the corporate trustee. It is legally
impossible to bankrupt the trustee qua trustee if the trustee can invoke the Article 32(1)
(a) limitation on the trustee's liability which extends only to the trust assets. Regardless of
whether the limitation on the trustee's liability under Article 32(1)(a) is engaged, in the
event that the trustee becomes insolvent a creditor of the trustee is entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity that becomes vested in the Viscount, but may only
recover up to extent of the trust assets. Where the limitation on the trustee's liability to
third parties is not engaged (Article 32(1)(b)) it remains possible to bankrupt the trustee
as a trustee (there being no distinction from the insolvency of the trustee as an entity). A
trustee is likely to have a multiplicity of creditors. The trustee will have personal creditors

The Trustee's Indemnity

and creditors in its capacity as trustee. It is necessary to delineate clearly which creditors
fall into which category. A personal creditor of the trustee cannot be subrogated to the
trustee's right of indemnity, although personal creditors of the trustee are entitled to the
proceeds of the trustee indemnity in the event of the trustee's insolvency if they represent
the reimbursement of payments made out of the trustee's own funds on the basis that had
the trustee remained solvent it would have been free to do with any reimbursement to itself
as it pleased. The proper parties to a third party's claim to be subrogated to the trustee's
right of indemnity are the person in whom the trust property is vested (which may not
necessarily be the trustee) and the trustee. rule 4/5 RCR 2004 provides that it is not necessary to join the beneficiaries of a trust to proceedings where the trustee has been joined.134
It remains unclear whether a creditor has a right of subrogation against the trustee's right
of indemnity in the case of a trust being void or voidable where the Court has a discretion
whether or not to allow the trustee an indemnity.

E. Priority as between the Trust's Unsecured Creditors
11-74

The issue of priority as between creditors subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity in
the event of an insolvency only comes to the fore where there are insufficient trust assets
to meet all claims. Because the solvency of a trust is to be judged on the trustee's ability to
satisfy debts as they fall due, there may in fact be sufficient trust assets available to meet all
claims given sufficient time. The personal creditors of the trustee in its capacity as trustee
have no right of subrogation to the trustee's indemnity from the trust fund but as a class the
unsecured creditors of the trustee (qua trustee) have, as the trustee has, priority over the
interests of the beneficiaries in the assets of the fund. Consistent with the position of unsecured creditors under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990 which rank pari passu
and not in order of time (ie the liability arising first being the first met from the fund),135
the claims of unsecured creditors of the trustee (qua trustee) also rank pari passu. This
avoids the requirement to undertake what could be a cumbersome and expensive enquiry
to determine the temporal order of debts. This approach appears to be consistent with cases
in Singapore,136 Australia137 and New Zealand.138 Unlike under English law, in Jersey law
the trust creditors, so far as they have not been satisfied out of the right of indemnity, are
not entitled to have recourse to the personal assets of the trustee or to share with the trustee's personal creditors in event that the trustee becomes insolvent.139

134 The authors of Lewin 19th edn (London, Sweet and Maxwell, 2014) 21-053 fn 206 indicate they do not
consider the English procedural equivalent of RCR 2004, r 4/2, namely CPR pt 19 r 19.7A, would apply but give no
explanation as to why. Given the decision in Glenalla, that a third party creditor has no right of recourse against
the trust assets independently of the trustee's right of indemnity, it seems that the trustee will always need to be
joined to the proceedings.

F. The Claims of Third Party Creditors against Beneficiaries
A trustee may distribute all or so large a portion of the trust assets to the beneficiaries as to
leave insufficient assets remaining in the fund to satisfy the incumbent or former trustee's
right of indemnity to meet liabilities to third parties as they fall due. The issue is whether it
is possible for creditors of the trust to 'reach through' to satisfy themselves from trust assets
distributed to the beneficiaries.
It is frequently the practice for an incumbent trustee to obtain indemnities from
beneficiaries when exercising a power to appoint a substantial proportion of the trust fund
to a beneficiary to enable the trustee to recoup liabilities incurred in the execution of the
trust. It is often the practice where chain indemnities are negotiated between successor and
retiring trustees that they provide for the successor trustee to obtain like for like indemnities
from beneficiaries for distributions above a de minimis proportion of the fund. That practice would appear consistent with the former trustee's entitlement to ensure that its right
of indemnity is not destroyed or jeopardised by a distribution to beneficiaries by a successor trustee.140 Such a distribution may be liable to be upset as a transaction at undervalue
or a preference by the Viscount or the trustee's liquidator if the trustee becomes insolvent
and the trustee has expended its own funds that it has not yet reimbursed from the trust
fund.141 If the trust subsequently becomes insolvent (or is made insolvent by the distribution) it appears that the distribution is not liable to be upset as a transaction at undervalue
or a preference on the basis that those jurisdictions are creatures of their respective statutes
which do not apply to the insolvency of a trust.142 The use of the power of appointment
making the distribution may be liable to challenge as an improper exercise of the trustee's
discretion if its exercise is known to (or would probably result in) the insolvency of the
trust.143 Funds derived from an order upsetting the distribution would be restored to the
fund in favour of the trust creditors in the same way as if it had not taken place.

Remedies against Accessories to a
Breach of Trust and Miscellaneous
Claims against Third Parties other
than in Respect of Breach of Trust
I. Introduction
Where a trustee has breached their duties as trustee, giving rise to an actionable breach
of trust claim, it may be possible for a trustee in default and facing the prospect of hostile
proceedings to seek to shift or share the burden of liability elsewhere so as to offer up an
additional or alternative defendant. Where there is more than one trustee, the 'innocent'
co-trustee will not be liable jointly and severally with the trustee in default, thereby precluding a contribution claim, unless the co-trustee became aware or ought to have become
aware of a breach of trust and the co-trustee actively conceals such breach or such intention
or fails within a reasonable time to take proper steps to protect or restore the trust property
or prevent such breach.1 Another way for the trustee to shift the burden of liability is to
seek an order under Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 impounding the beneficial interest of a beneficiary who has instigated, requested or consented to the breach of
trust. This chapter also considers the right of beneficiaries prejudiced by a breach of trust
to impound the beneficial interests of other beneficiaries implicated in the breach. The
remaining s­ ections of this chapter are concerned with the liability of accessories to breaches
of trust otherwise than on the basis of receipt of trust property, a topic which is considered
discretely in Chapter 9; the remedy available against accessories who dishonestly assist in a
breach of trust, claims against directors of a corporate trustee (so-called 'dog-leg' claims);
and miscellaneous tortious claims.

II. Impounding a Beneficial Interest in Order
to Indemnify the Trustee
12-2

Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides:
(1) Where a trustee commits a breach of trust at the instigation or at the request or with the consent
of a beneficiary, the court may by order impound all or part of the interest of the beneficiary2 by
way of indemnity to the trustee or any person claiming through the trustee.3
(2) Paragraph (1) applies whether or not such beneficiary is a minor or an interdict.

12-3

12-4

This provision is in similar terms to section 62 of the Trustee Act 1925. In the absence of a
wealth of Jersey authority, recourse may be had to the more developed jurisdiction under
the equivalent English provisions. For the provision to apply the beneficiary whose interest
is sought to be impounded must instigate, or request, or consent4 to some act or omission
which is itself a breach of trust and not merely one which becomes a breach of trust by
reason of want of care on the part of the trustees.5 The right conferred by an order under
Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law does not entitle the trustee to insist on remaining a
trustee until he has exercised this right which may be exercised by a former trustee.6
Article 46 is an infrequently litigated provision of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, there being
only two judgments on its invocation, the leading authority concerning an attempt to
invoke the provision which failed on the facts.7 In Sociedad Financiera Sofimeca, the Court
speculated whether it had jurisdiction to impound a beneficiary's interest under a trust
independent of the 1984 legislation as a substitute to, or to buttress, its inherent jurisdiction
to grant an injunction restraining the trust assets. On the facts no order was necessary as the
injunction and cross-undertaking in damages were sufficient to preserve the trust assets.
Article 46 does not seem to confer a jurisdiction on the Court to impound the beneficiary's
interest where a breach of trust is yet to be or about to be committed. In West v Lazard,
the Royal Court declined to be drawn on whether Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law
1984 could only operate against a beneficiary who has a fixed interest under a trust. There
appears to be no authority as to whether the equivalent provision in the English legislation,
section 62 of the Trustee Act 1925, is capable of applying to a beneficial interest that is not
a fixed interest. The obvious difficulty in a trustee impounding the interest of an object of a
discretionary overriding power of appointment is that such an interest is entirely valueless
and has no substance unless and until the power of appointment comes to be exercised.8

2 The interest must be in the actual estate of which the trustee seeking to impound is a trustee: Ricketts v Ricketts
(1891) 64 LT 263 at 265.
3 However, the trustee may not use an impounding order in respect of a loss sustained by himself as having
afterwards succeeded to a beneficial interest: Evans v Benyon (1887) 37 ChD 329.
4 Consent, it seems, need not necessarily be in writing; cf Trustee Act 1925, s 62.

v Kleinwort Benson (Jersey) Trustees Ltd & Or [1992 JRC 125].
8 AG v Tantular [2014 (2) JLR 25].

Impounding a Beneficial Interest

451

If it were possible to impound a discretionary beneficiary's interest, a trustee that subsequently sought to exercise a power of appointment in favour of that discretionary object
would clearly be in a position where his personal interests and fiduciary duties conflict as
he would be exercising the power in his own favour. Where an order under Article 46 of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 is sought by a former trustee against a discretionary beneficiary,
that may give rise to practical difficulties for the incumbent trustee, in whom the power of
appointment may be vested. Exercising that power to appoint trust assets to a discretionary
object, knowing that such assets are impounded by the former trustee to satisfy its liabilities
to the trust fund, would require such a degree of coordination in the exercise of the power
between the former trustee and incumbent trustee as to leave the whole exercise open to
challenge as an improper exercise of a power.
While Article 46 provides the trustee with a mechanism to satisfy its own liability to the
trust fund from the impounded interest, it does not have the effect of exculpating the trustee from liability to reconstitute the trust fund.9 The right to impound has been considered
as analogous to a right of subrogation; the trustee has to make good the breach of trust, but
is entitled to look to the beneficiary who consented to it or who instigated or requested it
to make good to him.10 The trustee would therefore remain liable for any shortfall if the
impounded interest was insufficient to meet the loss to the fund or the Court declines to
make the order sought.
The application of Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 should be considered where
a trust dispute between trustees and beneficiaries is compromised in whole or in part by
the payment of a sum from the fund that, if that sum were met from the fund in any other
circumstances, would amount to a breach of trust. The consent of the beneficiaries to the
payment of the sum from the fund as part of the compromise of the dispute is likely to
afford the trustee the opportunity to rely upon Article 46 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
if those same beneficiaries later attempt to pursue the trustee for diminution of the fund
caused by the payment.

A. Extent of the Beneficiaries' Knowledge that they Are Instigating,
Requesting or Consenting to a Breach of Trust
If the beneficiary has instigated, requested or consented to the trustee making or divesting
itself of a particular investment, it is not necessary that the beneficiary should know that
the investment (or sale) is in law a breach of trust, but they must know the facts which constitute the breach of trust.11 The Royal Court has stated that it is not possible to impound
a beneficiary's interest to indemnify a trustee guilty of fraudulent breach of trust unless
the beneficiary specifically authorised the fraudulent acts.12 While somewhat imperfect,
it is the authors' view that a workable test is whether facts were known to the beneficiary
which would be sufficient to bring home to the mind of a person of ordinary intelligence

the fact that the trustee was being invited to depart from his duty. Thus in the English decision of Re Somerset,13 a case in which the trustees committed a breach of trust by, with the
consent of the life tenant, investing trust money by way of a mortgage on property which
was (unknown to the life tenant) of insufficient value. While the tenant for life knew of the
property in which the trustees were investing, he was not informed of the valuations made
and was not, so far as it appeared, acquainted with the rental value, and so the case did not
fall within the then English equivalent of Article 46.

B. Exercise of the Court's Discretion
12-8

In the English case of Bolton v Curre14 it was held that the power given to the court by
­section 45 of the Trustee Act 1893, the then English statutory equivalent of Article 46 of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, was intended to enlarge the power of the court as to indemnifying trustees, and to give greater relief to trustees, and did not operate to curtail the previously existing rights and remedies of trustees in equity.15 As such, if the court would in a
particular case enforce the equity of the trustee and impound the interest of a beneficiary
in the hands of an assignee, the court was bound to do the same in a similar case following
the enactment of the legislation.16 That said, the Court's power under the general law and
under Article 46 is in the nature of a judicial discretion. The right of a trustee to have the
interest of a beneficiary impounded will prevail against an innocent assignee for value of
the beneficiaries' interest claiming under an assignment made after the commission of the
breach of trust17 or against a trustee in bankruptcy.18 Article 46 does not define the extent
of the liability of a concurring beneficiary but rather describes the cases in which the Court
may, if it thinks fit, impound all or any part of the interest of the beneficiary by way of
indemnity to the trustee.19

C. Impounding a Trust Interest in Order to
Indemnify the Beneficiaries
12-9

Despite a dearth of case law it is the authors' view that an aligned but separate jurisdiction to that available to trustees under Article 46, which exists as a matter of general law
in England, also exists as a matter of general law in Jersey, to ensure that if a beneficiary
who has a life or other partial interest joins in a breach of trust, then all the benefit which

would have accrued to the beneficiary, either directly or derivatively,20 whether from that
trust fund or any other property comprised in the same settlement,21 may be impounded
by the other beneficiaries or other persons having a similar equity, as against the concurring
beneficiary. In England, such impounding is effective against the concurring beneficiary's
trustee in bankruptcy,22 judgment creditors,23 or general creditors24 and (except so far as
the defence of purchase for value may be applicable) against all who claim under him25
until the amount impounded (with accumulations of its income)26 has compensated the
trust fund for the breach for which the beneficiary was responsible.
In English law, it has been observed27 that the principle that underpins this jurisdiction
does not extend so far as to entitle beneficiaries of part of the balance of money in a bank
account held on trust to stop the payment to the account holder of other money in the bank
account held free from trust in circumstances where the account holder had failed to pay
money into that account on trust for the beneficiaries and had instead paid the money into
an overdrawn account so as to prevent it being traced as trust property and consequently
could not therefore give rise to a right to impound.28 The lack of a trust fund with subsisting beneficial interests capable of being impounded proved fatal to the claim in the English
decision of Re BA Peters plc. Following Brazil v Durant,29 a like case might be determined
differently under Jersey law were a sufficient link between the original property and its
traceable proceeds through an overdrawn account to be capable of being proven.
The principle applies when the beneficiary is indebted to or is otherwise in default to the
trust, for instance, under an enforceable promise to pay a sum of money30 or the premiums
on an insurance policy.31 The principle applies only against property held under the same
trusts: thus if, after administration, a specific legacy and the residuary estate are held on
entirely distinct trusts, a beneficiary's interest in the former cannot be impounded to make
good his default in respect of the latter.32

If a trustee that has been guilty of a breach of trust also has a beneficial interest under the
trust instrument, (which will be rare where the trust is professionally administered) it will
not be allowed to receive any part of the trust fund in which it is equitably interested until it
has made good the breach of trust.33 The principle is that to the extent that it is in default34
it is regarded as having already received its share.35 It seems that the whole of the trustee's
beneficial interest, whether acquired before or after the breach of trust was committed, will,
as between itself and its co-trustee who is in pari delicto, be applied in making good the loss
to the fund. This certainly seems to be so where such a trustee/beneficiary has, as between
itself and his co-trustee, derived an exclusive benefit from the breach of trust.36 In English
law, the rule applies not only to beneficial interests given to the trustee directly by the trust
instrument, but also to interests acquired derivatively, eg by purchase from another beneficiary or inherited from them.37 The beneficial interest which the trustee claims under the
instrument is treated as being subject to an implied condition of the proper performance of
its duty as trustee.38 The trustee's assignee of such an interest is therefore in no better position than it would be, even where the default was committed by the trustee after assigning
its beneficial interest.39 But there can be no impounding of the trustee's beneficial interest if
the assignor does not become a trustee until after the assignment;40 and if the trustee holds
two distinct funds on distinct trusts, and has a beneficial interest in the first but not in the
second, the Court has no power to impound its beneficial interest in the first to make good
his default in the second.41

36 Chillingworth v Chambers (n 19). The decision in this case seems to involve the principle that the trustee
who is party to a breach of trust cannot, as between himself and his co-trustee, take anything out of the trust
fund until he has repaired his breach of trust. This principle, however, is not in terms enunciated. In his judgment
(at 707) Kay LJ, after an examination of all the authorities, said: 'On the whole, I think the weight of authority
is in favour of holding that a trustee, who, being also a cestui que trust, has received, as between himself and his
co-trustee, an exclusive benefit by the breach of trust, must indemnify his co-trustee to the extent of the benefit which
he has received. I think that the plaintiff must be treated as having received such an exclusive benefit'. Lindley LJ
(at 700) thought that the principle applied even where the beneficiary derived no benefit, however this principle
may be complicated by the fact that subject to Art 30(5)(a)-(b) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 Jersey trustees are
not jointly liable for a breach of trust.

III. Dishonest Assistance
In circumstances where a trustee, or other fiduciary in an analogous position to a trustee,
such as a company director,42 acts in breach of their duties, the primary claim is as against
the defaulting trustee or fiduciary. However, a person who is a third party to the trust or
fiduciary relationship who dishonestly assists in the breach of the primary obligation of
the trustee or fiduciary will become personally liable to compensate the beneficiaries to the
same extent as the trustee in whose breach of duty he assists. A dishonest assistant, like a
knowing recipient of trust assets misapplied in breach of trust, is a species of constructive
trustee, although that description has been criticised as inapposite as a dishonest assistant
owes no duties to the beneficiaries in the same way that the primary wrongdoing trustee
does, and the only liability of a dishonest assistant is a personal one.43 The basic requirements that must be established in order to found a claim for dishonest assistance are as
follows:44
1.
2.
3.
4.

12-13

There is a trust.
There is a breach of trust by the trustee of that trust.
The defendant induces or assists that breach of trust.
The defendant does so dishonestly.

Where each of these requirements is satisfied, the defendant is personally liable to account
to the plaintiff in respect of the breach of trust as though he were a trustee.45 The remedy
available against a dishonest assistant is a personal remedy. Although a constructive trust
is imposed on the defendant,46 the constructive trust is not to be confused with an institutional trust of a proprietary nature imposed on any property which is or has been in the
hands of the defendant. A dishonest assistance claim, being purely personal, will therefore
not survive the defendant's insolvency in which a successful plaintiff will have to prove for
their loss among the defendant's other unsecured creditors. Indeed there need be no property in the hands of the defendant for a claim in dishonest assistance to succeed. Rather, the
term 'constructive trust' must be understood in the sense of imposition of a personal liability to account on the basis applicable to a trustee. The term 'constructive trust', as in English
law, is used simply to describe the equitable obligation to account which is imposed on the
defendant to the action.47 The defendant is liable not because he is a trustee of any property,
but because he is a dishonest accessory to a breach of trust committed by someone else.48
The constructive trust imposed upon a dishonest assistant comes within the second kind

of constructive trust in the classification used in this work.49 Though a dishonest assistant
may be personally liable to account for profits made from his dishonest assistance, it does
not follow that such profits made by the defendant become subject to a constructive trust
in the proprietary sense, and the remedy of dishonest assistance cannot be used as a route
to a proprietary remedy in respect of the profits.50
What follows is a distillation of the general requirements set out above, special cases
­involving banks, the registration of share transfers, the appropriate measure of liability, the
position of agents holding trust money, vicarious liability and defences.51

A. Basis of Liability
i. Locus
12-16

Generally, those with standing to pursue a breach of trust claim will have standing to pursue a claim for dishonest assistance.52 A trustee who itself is guilty of making a transfer of
trust property in breach of trust and who wishes to recover either the property or equitable compensation of commensurate value before the beneficiaries wish to bring an action
either against the third party (or more likely the trustee for breach of trust) has locus to
bring a dishonest assistance claim as against the third party assistant, notwithstanding that
as between himself and the beneficiary there may be a breach of trust claim.

ii. Requirement (1)-a Trust
12-17

The requirement that there be a trust is not concerned with the description of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant in the claim for dishonest assistance but rather
with the trust which must be shown to exist if the defendant is to be made liable for assisting a breach of trust by the trustee in relation to it. There is no need for a trust in the formal
sense of property vested in one person held in trust for another person, although a formal
trust will certainly qualify. It will suffice if there is a fiduciary relationship in relation to
property, even if that relationship is not described as a 'trust'. Putting it at its most abstract,
if a person (T) is placed in possession of, or exercises command or control over, the property of another person (B) while the property remains B's property, and T can deal with
B's property only for the benefit of B or for purposes authorised by B, T is a trustee of the
property for the purposes of constructive trusteeship.53 The property in T's hands is treated
as subject to a trust. The most common example of this type of trust for these purposes
is the fiduciary relationship between the directors of a company and the company itself in
relation to the company's property, the director being the 'trustee' of the company's corporate assets, even though the property is likely to be owned by the company outright, being

the 'trust property'. Other agents and employees having property under their command or
control may also be treated as trustees, and the property as trust property.54 The analogy
between a trust in the formal sense and the kind of fiduciary relationship capable of giving rise to a constructive trusteeship is close. There is both a quasi-trustee and quasi-trust
property. But the analogy is less easily maintained where one is concerned with a fiduciary
relationship which does not relate to property in the hands of the fiduciary. Will any kind
of fiduciary relationship suffice, or must it be a relationship relating to property controlled
by the fiduciary? The example that is sometimes seen is of a person engaging a lawyer to
give him advice, when the lawyer breaches his fiduciary duty of loyalty by rendering advice
which, as the lawyer is aware, is contrary to the interest of the person engaging him, thereby
causing loss, and the lawyer is assisted by some third party in rendering the false advice. As
it appears to be in English law, in Jersey it remains an open question whether a fiduciary
relationship by itself is sufficient. It has been held at first instance in England that it is not,
and that there must be a trust (or quasi-trust) and trust (or quasi-trust) property.55 But the
English Court of Appeal has considered that the point is arguable,56 and at first instance
it has been held that a fiduciary relationship without trust property is sufficient.57 A claim
for dishonest assistance will certainly fail where there is no trust and no fiduciary relationship. However, a trust might be imposed by operation of law on property in circumstances
where there is no fiduciary relationship preceding the occurrence of the events which give
rise to the imposition of the trust, and where the duty of the person upon whom the trust
is imposed is to restore the property.58 This kind of trust, a constructive trust of the second
kind,59 involves no fiduciary relationship in any meaningful sense, but arises, for example,
where property is obtained by fraud, theft or mistake.60 The existence of such a trust will
however support a claim against a recipient of the property,61 but also those who assist in
its disposal, contrary to the duty of the recipient to restore the property to its true owner.62

iii. Requirement (2)-a Breach of Trust
12-18

A breach of trust, which includes for this purpose a breach of fiduciary obligation (in the
absence of a formal trust relationship) is an essential requirement. Dishonest assistance is
concerned with the liability of accessories for breach of trust, and if there is no breach of
trust the defendant cannot be an accessory. The breach of trust need not be a dishonest
one.63 To found the claim, it is the assistance that must be dishonest.64 That does not mean
that a third party who acts dishonestly in relation to a trust will escape liability if there
is no breach of trust, only that the cause of action available against that person will not
be dishonest assistance. A trustee may, for example, without any breach of trust engage a
dishonest agent who breaches his obligations to the trustee, and in that case the appropriate cause of action is one in contract or tort which will usually be vested in the trustee and
may be brought by the trustee, or in special circumstances by a beneficiary as a derivative
claim.
a. What Sort of Breach of Trust is Required?

12-19

There is some debate as to whether the only breach of trust capable of giving rise to a claim
for dishonest assistance must be a breach of trust relating to the misapplication of the trust
property or whether any breach of trust will suffice. This question is closely connected
with whether a fiduciary relationship by itself is sufficient to satisfy requirement (1) even
though it does not relate to any property. There is English authority that the breach of trust
must relate to a misapplication of trust property but there is some doubt.65 It should be
noted that although the leading Privy Council case, Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bd v Tan66
involved such a misapplication, there is nothing in that decision which positively requires
that the breach of trust must necessarily be of this character. The author is not aware of any
Jersey authority in which it has been held unnecessary for the breach to relate to the trust
property. It remains to be seen whether the Royal Court will extend the framework of the
cause of action to encompass breaches of trust that do not relate to the misapplication of
trust property. Conceptually, if the requirement is that the breach of trust must relate to the
misapplication of the trust property, then there could be no liability if the trustee in breach
of his duty of loyalty failed to obtain a profit for the trust fund which could have been
obtained and instead allows the profit to be diverted to someone else,67 or takes a bribe68
as neither of these scenarios strictly involve the misapplication of property subject to a
trust that exists prior to the breach.69 However, if the breach of trust which counts for the

ground that the agent's breach of fiduciary duty in accepting the bribe did not relate to the misappropriation of
property; but the relevant authorities were no considered.

purpose of requirement (2) extends beyond misapplication of property already subject to
a trust, it seems doubtful to the authors whether it would extend beyond breach of fiduciary obligations of good faith and loyalty, as distinct from breach of duty by a fiduciary; not
every breach of duty by a fiduciary, such as breach of a duty of care and skill, is a breach of
fiduciary duty.70
The leading Jersey decision on dishonest assistance71 concerned the inducement of a
family of Irish road hauliers, the Nolans, to invest substantial sums of money in various
schemes orchestrated by a fraudster, a Mr Walsh, through a group of companies controlled by him, known as the Buchanan Group. The Buchanan Group's directors were Jersey financial services providers who were the subject of the dishonest assistance claim on
the basis that they dishonestly carried out Mr Walsh's instructions as to how to apply the
funds invested by the Nolans. The trusts that were pleaded to satisfy requirement (1) were
two species of constructive trust: the Quistclose Trust72 and the so-called Halley Trust.73 It
was the Nolans' case in relation to each fraudulently induced investment that the breach
of trust had occurred (in the case of a Halley trust) when the relevant Buchanan Group
company had not returned the Nolans' monies at once, or (in the case of a Quistclose trust)
when it disbursed any part of the monies transferred by the Nolans other than for the
purpose of investment in accordance with the Nolans' agreement with Mr Walsh, and in
particular disbursed any such monies outside the Buchanan Group structure. In respect of
the investments said to be subject to Quistclose trusts, the Court held that to the extent that
the Nolans did eventually receive the shareholdings that had been agreed between them
and Mr Walsh, any relevant Quistclose trust had in due course been fulfilled and therefore
no breach could be proven. The Royal Court held that to the extent that there had been
any breach of trust arising out of the monies invested by the Nolans having been paid away
prior to such shareholdings being received by them, any such breach of trust was, at worst,
merely technical and not causative of any damage to them. It seems therefore that for a
breach to qualify the breach must be more than merely technical and must be such as to
give rise to a recoverable loss.

12-20

b. Breach of Duty and Trustee Exoneration or Trustee Exemption Clauses
The effect of clauses of this kind in dishonest assistance claims is discussed here, rather
than in the section below dealing with general defences, because an effective exemption or
exoneration clause can only be deployed to defend the trustee responsible for the breach in
which the accessory has dishonestly assisted, and cannot be deployed to defend the accessory itself. A distinction can be drawn between clauses which operate to enlarge trustees'
powers or abridge their duties ('exoneration clauses'), and clauses which excuse trustees
from personal liability for breach of trust ('exemption clauses').74 If an exoneration clause
applies, there is no breach of trust and so no question of secondary liability for dishonest
assistance by third parties will arise. If an exemption clause applies it only has the effect of

excusing the trustee from personal liability for breach of trust; the clause is not effective
so as to prevent the breach of trust from having taken place. It follows that even with an
effective exemption clause a third party who assists the breach of trust dishonestly may be
made liable, even though the trustee within the protection of the clause is not personally
liable at all.75

iv. Requirement (3)-Inducement or Assistance in a Breach of Trust
12-22

It is always a question of fact in each case whether the defendant has rendered assistance.76
To qualify, assistance must be conduct which in fact assists the commission of the act which
is a breach of trust by the trustee. Assistance does not have any mental element in addition
to the separate requirement of dishonesty.77 The assistance must be of more than minimal
importance,78 and must enable the breach by the trustee to be committed,79 but there is no
requirement that what is done by the defendant inevitably has the consequence that a loss
is suffered.80
a. When Must the Assistance be Rendered?

12-23

The assistance normally precedes the breach of trust or is contemporaneous with it. Where
the assistance takes the form of inducement, it must necessarily precede the breach. The
assistance may even take place before the trustee who commits the breach of trust takes
office, for example where a third party facilitates the appointment to office of a fraudulent
trustee so as to enable the third party to misappropriate the trust fund.81 Once the breach
of trust has been fully implemented, the subsequent acts or omissions of the defendant
will not assist its commission because the breach of trust will already been committed.82
However, in those cases where the breach of trust consists of the misappropriation of assets,
the correct approach is to treat the breach as a continuing one, not ending when the assets
have initially been removed from the trust fund, but when they have been squirreled away in
an attempt to put them beyond the reach of the beneficiaries who might seek their r­ ecovery.
The assistance that is effectively being rendered in such circumstances, although it may not
be described as such, is de facto money laundering and, as the decision in Nolan demonstrates, Jersey's corporate, investment and fiduciary service providers are at acute risk of
being made liable for dishonest assistance if they fail to undertake proper due diligence on
the individuals and funds with whom they deal and fail to give proper consideration to the

75 For the effect of such clauses generally see Ch7. Article 30(10) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 precludes any
provision that has the effect of relieving, releasing or exonerating a trustee from liability for breach of trust ­arising
from the trustee's own fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence. See also Armitage v Nurse [1997] EWCA
Civ 1279, per Millett LJ: 'irreducible core of obligations'.

appropriateness of their instructions or requests. Large institutional defendants are also
likely to be perceived as having deep pockets and well able to satisfy a claim if the initial
wrongdoer has fled the scene or is otherwise not worth pursuing.83 Accordingly, those who
assist in money laundering after the breach of trust has first occurred may be made liable
for dishonest assistance. In money laundering cases, the assistance will normally take the
form of receiving, holding, possibly investing and then parting with money representing the
trust property while it is in the course of being laundered.84 For the purpose of establishing
assistance in this kind of case, it will may be necessary to trace the money representing the
trust property into the hands of the defendant, using Jersey's rules as to tracing,85 although
assistance that consists of services to conceal or disguise the misappropriated property may
also attract civil (and criminal) liability even though the property does not come into the
assistant's hands.86
Where the defendant is a financial institution or one offering fiduciary services, the assistance can take the form of receipt and then distribution of a fund. As an alternative to a
claim for dishonest assistance, the defendant may also be made personally liable under the
principle in Guardian Trust,87 which does not require the defendant to have assisted anyone
else's breach of trust nor proof of dishonesty, if the defendant is on notice of an adverse
claim to the fund at the time of the distribution.

12-24

v. Requirement (4)-Dishonesty
The Royal Court, in line with the now accepted position in England and Wales, has
adopted an objective test for dishonesty,88 best expressed by Lord Nicholls in Royal Brunei
Airlines v Tan:
in the context of the accessory liability principle acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity, which
is synonymous, means simply not acting as an honest person would in the circumstances. This is
an objective standard. At first sight this may seem surprising. Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence. Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective
element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually
knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated.
Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not
inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be
equated with conscious impropriety. However, these subjective characteristics of dishonesty do not
mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in the particular circumstances.

83 Nolan v Minerva Trust Co Ltd (n 45); Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265; Society of England and Wales
v Habitable Concepts Ltd [2010] 1449 (Ch) at [23]. As to cases where the trustee makes a profit from the trust for
which he is personally liable to account but which does not become subject to a proprietary constructive trust,
and the assistance is merely in the disposal of the profit (but not in the breach of duty in making the profit then
dishonest assistance would not arise if the breach must relate to the misapplication of trust property).

The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale,
with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual. If a person knowingly appropriates another's property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he
sees nothing wrong in such behaviour.89

12-26

In most cases there is unlikely to be any difficulty in applying this test:90
Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not intentionally take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person
does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the
detriment of the beneficiaries. Nor does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes
and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and
then proceed regardless.

a. The Subjective and Objective Elements of Dishonesty
12-27

12-28

12-29

It will be observed that the test for dishonesty, while stated to be objective, contains within
it both subjective and objective elements. The subjective element is concerned with all the
circumstances known to the particular defendant in question: his personal attributes such
as his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted as he did.91 For these purposes, knowledge (ie what the defendant actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a
reasonable person would have known or appreciated ie constructive knowledge)92 includes
suspicion relating to the transaction concerned, combined with a conscious decision not
to make enquiries which might result in knowledge.93 Significantly, in Nolan v Minerva the
circumstances known to the defendant were held to include the statutory and regulatory
environment to which the defendant was subject as a company carrying on regulated 'trust
company business' within the meaning of Article 2(3) of the Financial Services (Jersey)
Law 1998.94 The defendant's general suspicion that the trustee has been involved in money
laundering activities will not suffice as 'knowledge' for these purposes if there is no such
suspicion in relation to the particular transaction concerned.95
A particular difficulty in relation to assessing subjective knowledge for these purposes is
determining whose knowledge is relevant. In large organisations specific pieces of relevant
knowledge may be dispersed among individual employees so as to make the overall picture
unintelligible until such pieces of relevant knowledge are accumulated together.
In Nolan v Minerva, it was argued (unsuccessfully) that in assessing whether a defendant
had acted dishonestly in relation to any particular transaction, each transaction had to be
viewed in isolation from any of the others, and that it was impermissible to adopt a cumulative approach to an alleged failure to make enquiries. Following this approach to its logical

conclusion, if an honest employee would have been obliged to find out some information
in relation to a previous transaction and the dishonest employee failed to do so, the Court
could not in relation to a subsequent transaction attribute to the dishonest employee the
knowledge he would have acquired if he had made the enquiry that an honest employee
would have made in relation to the earlier transaction. In short, the Court was being asked
to ignore what the defendant ought, or ought not, to have done in relation to any previous
transaction. The correct approach was held to be to treat the defendant as having had the
knowledge which it would have gained if it had in fact made enquiries in relation to earlier
transactions. If in relation to an earlier transaction an honest employee would have made
enquiries and thereby acquired knowledge that would have informed a subsequent transaction, one must look at both transactions as a continuum. The suggestion that one should
wipe the slate clean at the start of each transaction and ignore the information that an honest employee would have acquired from an earlier transaction was held to be both logically
indefensible and legally incorrect.
Having established the defendant's mental state, the objective element of dishonesty is
ascertained by objectively assessing the defendant's mental state within the parameters set
by his subjective mental state. If by ordinary standards the defendant's mental state would
be characterised as dishonest, it is irrelevant that the defendant would judge himself by
a different standard.96 There is also no need for the defendant to realise that his conduct
was dishonest by the normally accepted standards of honest conduct, nor does he need to
be conscious that he is transgressing those standards.97 In other words, a defendant cannot escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he himself sees nothing wrong in his
­behaviour.98 The objective standard of dishonesty does not depend upon an inquiry into
what all (as distinct from some) normal people regard as dishonest and it is irrelevant that
there may be a body of opinion which regards the ordinary standard of honest behaviour
as being set too high.99
Dishonesty is therefore something of an elephant test, which is to say many practitioners
will recognise it when they see it. However, at the outer edges of what many practitioners
would ordinarily consider to be dishonest there are interesting questions as to the proper
conceptual bounds of dishonest assistance and whether the cause of action may be suffering from a form of 'mission creep'. Is a lawyer or other professional who acts on the instructions of a fiduciary, in cases of doubt as to the existence or scope of dispositive powers or in
cases of so called 'judicious' breaches of trust, a dishonest assistant? This is still a developing
area of jurisprudence on which serious legal and reputational risk can rest on some very
fine and, it could be said, not wholly coherent distinctions.

the application, which is later established to be a misapplication and so a breach of trust,
how does one assess the defendant in terms of dishonesty? Lord Nicholls gave the following
answer in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan:
The only answer to these questions lies in keeping in mind that honesty is an objective standard.
The individual is expected to attain the standard which would be observed by an honest person
placed in those circumstances. It is impossible to be more specific. Knox J. captured the flavour
of this, in a case in a commercial setting, when he referred to a person who is 'guilty of commercially unacceptable conduct in the particular context involved:' see Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd
v Eagle Trust plc. Acting in reckless disregard of others' rights or possible rights can be a tell-tale
sign of dishonesty. An honest person would have regard to the circumstances known to him,
including the nature and importance of the proposed transaction, the nature and importance
of his role, the ordinary course of business, the degree of doubt, the practicability of the trustee
or the third party proceeding otherwise and the seriousness of the adverse consequences to the
beneficiaries. The circumstances will dictate which one or more of the possible courses should be
taken by an honest person. He might, for instance, flatly decline to become involved. He might
ask further questions. He might seek advice, or insist on further advice being obtained. He might
advise the trustee of the risks but then proceed with his role in the transaction. He might do
many things. Ultimately, in most cases, an honest person should have little difficulty in knowing
whether a proposed transaction, or his participation in it, would offend the normally accepted
standards of honest conduct.

12-33

12-34

12-35

Whether an agent of a trustee who becomes involved in doubtful transactions will be liable as a dishonest assistant under the test set out above will turn on a careful appraisal of
the facts in order to ascertain whether the individual has attained the standard expected
of an honest person placed in those circumstances or fallen below it.
Consider, for example, a situation in which a trustee is minded to advance the trust fund
worth £50,000, subject to the reversionary interests of a class of minors and unborns, to
the life tenant under a power of advancement which the trustee believes to be vested in
it. After consultation with its lawyers the trustee is advised that there is no better than a
50 per cent chance that the power can validly be exercised in the way proposed and that the
only means of resolving the matter would be to launch either an application to court for
construction of the power, or by way of approval of an arrangement under Article 47 of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. The costs of either application could easily reach £30,000.
The trustee informs his lawyers that it does not wish to expend that amount of cost on
lawyers at the expense of the fund and the advancement will be made on the basis that
the life tenant, who is in good financial standing, will give an indemnity to the trustees
secured on his controlling holding in a valuable private company. In light of the factual
circumstances, it is the authors' view that that the lawyers would not be acting dishonestly
in complying with the trustee's instructions to draft the documents needed to effect the
advancement.
One does not have to change the facts radically to lean towards a different conclusion on the
lawyers' liability. Suppose that the trust fund is £6 million rather than £50,000. Suppose the
life tenant is in straitened financial circumstances and (the trustee suspects) owes a significant sum to his sister. Suppose the trustee's power of advancement requires the consent of
the protector (the sister of the life tenant) which, if established, could vitiate the exercise of
the power of advancement as being subject to a conflict of interest.

Dishonest Assistance

465

If the lawyers are instructed to prepare the necessary documents having given the same
advice (plus advice on the likely conflict of interest in the exercise of the power) which
is rejected by the trustee, then having regard to (1) the apparent absence of any plausible
reason why the trustee, if acting in good faith, would wish to proceed contrary to advice;
(2) the unanswered suspicion as to an improper purpose; (3) the fact that the fund could
easily absorb the cost of a court application; and (4) the clear prejudice to the minors'
reversionary interest then we consider that the lawyers, if they complied with the trustee's
instructions, would be at risk of being held liable for dishonest assistance.
The most appropriate course in these circumstances would be for the lawyers to withdraw,
which may be simpler than it sounds if there is trust money in the client account. If the
trustee instructs the lawyers to remit the money to it so that it could implement the proposed advancement itself it would not be safe for the solicitors simply to comply with the
instruction who could be at risk of inconsistent dealing.100 The better course would be for
lawyers to apply to the Court for directions.

c. Assistance in Improper or Unauthorised Investments or Similar Transactions
There is an important distinction between a trustee misusing its powers and a trustee acting
in excess of power. A trustee may misuse its power by making an investment or entering
into any transaction falling within its powers but which is imprudent and not in the interests of the trust. If the application of trust funds results in a challenge to the exercise of the
power of investment on the basis of imprudence, that is usually insufficient to expose an
assistant in that investment to liability for dishonest assistance.101
However, if the challenge to the exercise of the investment power or other transaction goes
beyond mere imprudence, then the defendant who consciously assists in it is exposed to
risk of a claim for dishonest assistance:

12-38

12-39

All investment involves risk. Imprudence is not dishonesty, although imprudence may be carried
recklessly to lengths which call into question the honesty of the person making the decision. This
is especially so if the transaction serves another purpose in which that person has an interest of
his own.102

The position is different where the investment or other transaction is clearly known by both
the trustees and the assistant to be in excess of the trustee's powers. On this matter Lord
Nicholls made the following observations:
This type of risk is to be sharply distinguished from the case where a trustee, with or without the
benefit of advice, is aware that a particular investment or application of trust property is outside
his powers but nevertheless he decides to proceed in the belief or hope that this will be beneficial
to the beneficiaries or, at least, not prejudicial to them. He takes a risk that a clearly unauthorised
transaction will not cause loss. A risk of this nature is for the account of those who take it. If the

100

See Ch 9.
However, if the advice of the defendant is sought as to the prudence of the investment, and his advice is
negligent, he may be held liable in contract or tort at the instance of the trustees or, in special circumstances, of
the beneficiaries.
102 Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan (n 48) at 389H, per Lord Nicholls.
101

12-40

466

Remedies against Accessories

risk materialises and causes loss, those who knowingly took the risk will be accountable accordingly. This is the type of risk being addressed by Peter Gibson J. in the Baden case, when he accepted
that fraud includes 'taking a risk to the prejudice of another's rights, which risk is known to be one
which there is no right to take'.103

12-41

Two points are made. First, if a trustee enters into a transaction which is beyond his powers
and causes loss, he is liable even though he believes or hopes that the transaction is beneficial to the beneficiaries or at least not prejudicial to them. That is because the trustee's
liability is strict and good motive is not a defence. Not all deliberate breaches of trust are
dishonest. There is an important distinction between deliberate breaches of trust, commonly called judicious breaches of trust, which are believed to be in the interests of the beneficiaries and breaches of trust committed with an appreciation of a risk that is prejudicial
to the beneficiaries (or with reckless indifference whether they are prejudiced or not) and
which is known to be a risk of which there is no right to take. Such a distinction is sometimes seen in the context of discussion of trustee exemption clauses104 and, in the interest
of consistency, the same distinction can and should be made in the context of dishonest
assistance. It would seem to us to be a harsh result if third party assistants were made liable
for consciously assisting in judicious breaches of trust, and since the test for the defendant's
liability is dishonesty rather than knowledge, there is no good reason why in this kind of
case the third party, as distinct from the trustee, should be made liable.
d. Assistance in Distributions to Beneficiaries Who Are Not Entitled

12-42

12-43

12-44

Usually there will not be a difficulty in determining the liability of a third party for dishonest assistance in connection with wrongful distributions to beneficiaries. If the defendant
is unaware that the beneficiary is not entitled nor that there is at least a doubt, he lacks the
knowledge upon which he can be held to be objectively dishonest, and so he escapes liability
as a dishonest assistant, even if he may be grossly negligent.
We have already discussed the applicable principles where there is a doubt as to the beneficiary's entitlement.105 If the defendant is aware that the distribution is unauthorised, even
if the trustee is not, then he must surely be liable as a dishonest assistant, in the same way as
if a trustee assists in a distribution to a person who is known not to be a beneficiary. Thus if
a lawyer drafts documents to affect a wrongful distribution of capital to a life tenant who, as
he is aware, has no interest in capital, he could be liable for dishonest assistance.
One stage removed from a situation where the assistant has doubt as to whether the trustee's dispositive powers are being exercised within their scope is a situation in which there is

103 ibid, at 390A-B, per Lord Nicholls. See Wakelin v Read [2000] PLR 319 in which the director of a corporate
trustee of a company's pension scheme, who was also the chief executive of the company, which was in financial
difficulties and needed money urgently to pay a dividend, arranged for the trustee of the pension scheme to buy
land from the company at what was, for a forced sale by the company, at an inflated price, oblivious to the conflict
of interest and with more than a touch of Nelsonian blindness, was held liable for dishonest assistance.
104 See Armitage v Nurse [1998] Ch 241 at 251B-D and 252G, CA; Walker v Stones [2001] QB 902 at 936-41, CA,
where it was accepted that judicious breaches of trust were not dishonest, though a solicitor-trustee's belief that
he was acting in the interests of the beneficiaries, though actually held, was characterised as dishonest if the belief
was so unreasonable that, by an objective standard, no reasonable solicitor-trustee could have thought that what
he did or agreed to do was for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
105 See above.

Dishonest Assistance

467

a beneficiary presumptively entitled to capital at a set date in the future, but whose interest
is contingent on an event which is so likely to occur as to make it a virtual certainty, or is
liable to have that presumptive interest defeated by an event which is so unlikely to occur as
to make it a very remote possibility. If the defendant is aware that the beneficiary's interest
is contingent and has advised the trustee of this but is instructed by the trustee to prepare
the documents necessary to give effect to a distribution which the trustee does not otherwise have power to make, on the expectation that nothing can possibly go wrong so as to
engage the contingency, does that make the lawyer a dishonest assistant if having executed
the documents, the contingency unexpectedly occurs?
The answer, it seems, depends upon whether the probability of the beneficiary becoming absolutely or indefeasibly entitled at the date of distribution is not sufficiently great to
justify the distribution under principles which we have previously considered. The trustee might be prepared to take the risks involved, protecting itself by indemnities, in the
knowledge that if the unexpected happens it will be liable.
This is not a scenario that has ever been tested before the Royal Court. In our view, it would
be harsh if lawyers or others who assisted the trustees, after giving due warning of the risks
involved in giving effect to the distribution, were made liable for dishonest assistance. We
consider that this is a case where the test of unacceptable conduct in the particular context
involved should be applied to determine whether the objective element in the test of dishonesty is satisfied. It must also be established that the defendant knew that his conduct was
unacceptable. It must be said that the authors regard the position as less clear-cut than in a
case of a judicious breach of trust because it is undoubtedly the case that the distribution
is, and is known by the defendant to be, prejudicial to the interest of the beneficiary who
becomes entitled if the unexpected contingency occurs.

e. Ignorance of the Law-Relevance to Dishonesty
Neither Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan nor the Jersey authorities that have followed that
decision address the effect of the rule of public policy (which applies also in Jersey) that
ignorance of the law is no defence to establishing a defendant's dishonesty. There is a distinction between two categories of ignorance. The first kind of ignorance is where the
defendant is unaware that a proposed application of trust money is unauthorised. For
example the defendant has misread the trust instrument, perhaps negligently, perhaps not,
and considers that the terms of the trust authorises the proposed distribution, though on its
true construction it does not. It is our view that a lawyer could not be liable as a dishonest
assistant where there has been an honest muddle, simply because of his ignorance of the
legal effect of the document.106 However, if the misapplication of the trust funds arises from
having deliberately shuts his eyes to the legal effect of the document and acting in clear disregard of its terms without making inquiries which he knows that an honest person would
make, then the requirement of dishonesty is satisfied.107

106
107

Such an 'honest muddle' may found an action, vested in the trustee in negligence.

12-47

468
12-48

Remedies against Accessories

The second kind of ignorance is where the defendant is fully aware that the proposed
distribution is unauthorised, but is so ignorant of trust law that he does not appreciate
the seriousness of the breach of trust involved, and thinks that there is nothing wrong
in the distribution taking place. Ignorance of this second kind does not absolve the
defendant from a finding of dishonesty. As was said by Lord Hoffmann in Twinsectra Ltd
v Yardley:157
I do not suggest that one cannot be dishonest without a full appreciation of the legal analysis of the
transaction. A person may dishonestly assist in the commission of a breach of trust without any
idea of what a trust means. The necessary dishonest state of mind may be found to exist simply on
the fact that he knew perfectly well that he was helping to pay away money to which the recipient
was not entitled.

f. Ignorance of the Trust-Relevance to Dishonesty
12-49

In principle, a defendant cannot be held liable as a dishonest assistant if he is ignorant of
the trust since there is no basis upon which he could have been held to be dishonest. If, for
example, someone is the legal owner of property and instructs a lawyer to act in the sale of
that property and the remission of the proceeds of sale to an account in the name of the
legal owner abroad, there is nothing that appears from the face of the transaction which is
improper, and though the solicitor may be negligent in failing to appreciate that the legal
owner in fact holds the land on trust, he is not dishonest and not liable for dishonest assistance. However, where the defendant is aware that he is involved in effectively laundering
money or shuts his eyes to that obvious fact and allows his services to be used then there is
no need to prove that the money launderer had knowledge of the trust, and it is no defence
for him to say that he thought that the scheme in which he was involved was 'only' a breach
of exchange control or 'only' a case of tax evasion. A man who consciously assists others by
making arrangements which he knows are calculated to conceal what is happening from a
third party, takes the risk that they are part of a fraud practised on the third party.108 If it
is not plain to the defendant that he is involved in money laundering, then it needs to be
shown that the defendant had knowledge of the trust so that dishonesty can be established
against him.109
g. Pleading Dishonesty

12-50

An allegation of dishonesty must be clearly pleaded in the Order of Justice.110 This involves
setting out concisely the facts upon which the allegation of the subjective element of dishonesty is founded, and also the facts upon which reliance is placed as demonstrating that
the objective element is satisfied, at any rate unless it is manifest that if the facts supporting

the subjective element are proved, then the objective element would be satisfied too.111
An advocate must not draft any pleading, affidavit, notice of appeal or other document
containing an allegation of dishonesty unless he has clear instructions to make such allegation and has before him reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima
facie case of dishonesty.112
h. Proving Dishonesty
The Jersey and English authorities on proof of knowledge in the context of claims for
­knowing receipt113 are also of application in relation to proof of dishonesty, albeit that the
Court is less likely to draw an inference of dishonesty than of knowledge, and where the
issue is one of dishonesty, the burden of proof is a heavy one.114 It is not open to the Court
to infer dishonesty from facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been
pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must be some fact which tilts the balance
and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be both pleaded and proved.115
In discharging that burden, the Court is not looking for a higher degree of probability.
It is only that the more inherently improbable the act in question, the more compelling
will be the evidence needed to satisfy the Court on a preponderance of probability.116 In
the absence of some financial or other incentive, a charge of dishonesty against professional persons is possible but inherently improbable.117 When assessing the probabilities
the Court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular
case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and,
hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the Court concludes that the allegation
is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence.118 If
the facts proved by the plaintiff as to the proper inferences to be drawn from the defendant's
conduct are such as to shift the evidential burden to him, it will not be safe for the defendant to call no evidence, since the Court may infer dishonesty even though the defendant
might have been able to provide a credible explanation of his conduct had he elected to call
evidence.119
Where the defendant is a financial services business regulated by the Jersey Financial ­Services
Commission (JFSC), how can dishonesty be proven? Helpfully, the JFSC has issued Codes
of Practice for the purpose of establishing sound principles for the conduct of financial
services business under the Financial Service (Jersey) Law 1998.120 In addition, the JFSC has

issued four 'Handbooks' under Article 22 of the Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies)
(Jersey) Law 2008 for the purpose of establishing sound principles for compliance with that
legislation and Jersey's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism legislation.121 These
Codes/Handbooks set out the standards expected of regulated service providers to which
they apply and provide a benchmark by which they can be and are judged by the Commission. Whilst Article 19(3) of the Financial Service (Jersey) Law 1998 and Article 22(4) of the
Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 provide, respectively, that failure
to follow the Codes/Handbooks shall not of itself render any person liable to proceedings
of any kind or invalidate any transaction, Articles 19(4) and 22(4) respectively provide that,
subject to a condition of registration indicating that any part or parts of the Codes/­Handbooks
are to be wholly or partly disregarded by a registered person, the Codes/­Handbooks shall be
admissible in evidence if it appears to the Court, conducting the proceedings, to be relevant
to any questions arising in the proceedings and shall be taken into account in determining any such questions. While a failure to follow the Codes/­Handbooks will not inevitably
mean there has been dishonesty, in many cases the relevant issue for the Court will be
what would an honest person, acting on behalf of the defendant financial services business,
have done? Where that is the issue, the standard of honesty is inevitably likely to be judged
against the appropriate Code/Handbook.

B. Measure of Liability
12-53

A dishonest assistant is in no better position as regards the measure of liability than the
trustee whose breach of trust he is dishonestly assisting. Therefore an express trustee's
liability to restore trust assets by reference to their value at the date of proceedings and
without deduction for fiscal liabilities will apply equally to a constructive trustee.122 Under
Article 30(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, a plaintiff could recover any profit which it
would have made if the breach of trust had not occurred and not merely any profits which
the defendants had in fact made.123 The quantum of the dishonest assistant's liability may
be greater than that against the trustee, in that if the defendant has been dishonest but the
trustee has not, the Court may award compound interest against the defendant but not
against the trustee.124 In a case where the trustee has committed a series of breaches some
only of which have been assisted by the defendant, the defendant's liability is limited to the
loss caused by those of the breaches which he has assisted.125 Subject to the issue of interest,
the liability of the assistant is for such loss as the trustee would be liable for, and it is not
necessary to show that the assistance itself is causative of loss.126

Sector and for Estate Agents and High Value Dealers.

Dishonest Assistance

471

i. Protection of Agent by Application to the Court
A lawyer or other agent will find himself in a difficult position if he holds money in trust
for his principal and then gains knowledge that the money is or might be the proceeds of
a fraud by his principal. If he pays the money over to his principal, or to a third party at
his direction, it might be alleged against him that his parting with the money after gaining
knowledge of the alleged fraud exposes him to liability either for dishonest assistance, or
perhaps under the principle in Guardian Trust.127 If he refuses to pay the money over to his
principal, or on his directions to a third party, or if he alerts the victims of the alleged fraud
to the possibility of a claim against his principal, then he is or may be liable for breach of
duty to his principal if the fraud claims prove to be ill-founded. Holding money that is or is
suspected to be the proceeds of fraud is very likely to require an agent to make a Suspicious
Activity Report to the Jersey Financial Crimes Unit under the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey)
Law 1999 and, if so, the agent will be bound by the anti-tipping off provisions so as to
prevent him communicating with his principal.128 The Court is likely to be sympathetic
to an agent in this position, who may apply to the Court, with leave, for directions under
Article 51(2)(a)(i)129 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 both as to what information, if any,
he should give to the trustees, notwithstanding his duties of confidentiality to his client,
and as to whether the whole or any part of the property concerned should be released to
his client.

The English law on the vicarious liability of partners was settled by the House of Lords in
Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam.130 Jersey has no statutory equivalent of the Partnership
Act 1890 but under customary law principles it is very likely that a firm will be liable (and
so individual partners are liable) for dishonest assistance by an individual partner provided
he is acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm or with the authority of his
co-partners. For these purposes, the partner guilty of dishonest assistance will be acting in
the ordinary course of the business of the firm where the acts sufficient to impose liability
on him are so closely connected with acts that he is authorised to perform that he can fairly
and properly be regarded as acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm, as
where he, for example, drafts documents such as an instrument of appointment necessary
to effect a fraudulent conspiracy to misappropriate trust money.

able to a defendant are concurrence, acquiescence or release. Contributory negligence is
not a defence to a claim in dishonest assistance and a defence that pleads that the plaintiff
had the opportunity to discover the fraud of which complaint is made and failed to take
it is liable to be struck out.131 Only where the plaintiff is the author of his own misfortune
will a defence be available. So if a plaintiff discovers the fraud but takes no action to prevent
further loss from arising, his inactivity may bar his claim for relief against a wrongdoer in
respect of subsequent losses.132

i. The Illegality Defence and the Attribution of Wrongdoing as a Defence
12-57

Where a company is the victim of unlawful or fraudulent conduct by its directors, a third
party who has dishonestly assisted in the directors' breach of duty will not be able to defend
themselves from a claim by the company on the ground that the director's wrongdoing should be attributed to the company so as to bar a claim by the company under the
ex turpi causa principle.133

ii. Contribution
12-58

Unlike in English law,134 a defendant to a Jersey action who is held liable for dishonest assistance, or who enters into a bona fide settlement or compromise of such a claim, may not, it
seems, seek a contribution from any other person (such as the trustee and any other person
held liable as a dishonest assistant) under Article 3(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Jersey) Law 1960.135 That is because Jersey's legislation governing the law
on contributions between defendants is drafted in much narrower terms than its modern
UK equivalent. The right of a defendant to seek a contribution in Jersey is confined only to
contributions for 'damage [that] is suffered by any person as a result of a tort'.136 The issue
is whether an action for dishonest assistance can be described as a tort. A tort has been
defined by in the following terms:
Tortious liability arises from the breach of a duty primarily fixed by the law; such duty is towards
persons generally and its breach is redressible by an action for unliquidated damages137

12-59

If no contribution claim is possible, consideration needs to be given to whether the Court
may join third parties to the proceedings by another means. Rule 6/10(l)(b) RCR 2004 provides that the Court may grant a defendant to an action leave to bring a third party claim
if the defendant claims against such a person any relief or remedy relating to or connected
with the original subject-matter of the action and substantially the same as some relief or

remedy claimed by the plaintiff. RCR 6/10(l)(b) requires two things: first, that the defendant has a claim for a relief or remedy against the third party which is related to the subjectmatter of the action for dishonest assistance, and second, that such relief or remedy be
substantially the same as that sought by plaintiff against the dishonest assistant. Whilst it
is true that the party with primary liability on the one hand, and the dishonest assistant on
the other, are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in respect of a breach of the trust,
(such that the second limb of the rule may arguably be fulfilled) no lis is easily discernible
as between the dishonest assistants and the fiduciary who has breached their duties. The
fiduciary whom is said to have breached their duties will owe duties to the plaintiff but
owes no any actionable duty to the dishonest assistant. It is also questionable whether the
determination of a dishonest assistance claim requires that the primary wrongdoers to be
joined as parties before the Court so as provide the Court with a basis to order joinder
under rule 6/10(l)(c) RCR 2004.

iii. Prescription
The Royal Court's in Nolan v Minerva Trust considered the most appropriate prescription period for a claim in dishonest assistance to be analogous to that applicable to the
economic torts of deceit and procurement of a breach of a contract, ie three years. It did
so on the basis firstly that a dishonest assistant is a type-two constructive trustee and
therefore not within the indefinite limitation period for actions under Article 57(1) of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. Secondly, that other jurisdictions had concluded that a dishonest
assistance claim was so close to that of accessory liability in the context of economic
torts that it would have been perverse to attempt to characterise dishonest assistance by
mechanically applying the canons of Jersey customary law, instead of reaching for the clear
analogy which is available in other jurisdictions.138 However, the Court was clear that in
applying the dicta in Esteem139 of seeking to establish 'some other period is, by analogy,
clearly more applicable' as a matter of Jersey law, what has to be analogous is the period,
not the cause of action.
It does not appear to have been argued in Nolan v Minerva Trust that the analogous
limitation period for dishonest assistance (both in terms of the period and the substance of
the cause of action) could be three years as 'an action [by a beneficiary] founded on breach
of trust' as per the formulation used in Article 57(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. We
therefore do not regard the Royal Court as holding that dishonest assistance is an economic
tort, thereby capable of giving rise to a defendant's right to seek a contribution under the
1960 Law, but merely that for the purpose of prescription only, dishonest assistance is to be
regarded as analogous to an economic tort.140
While what the beneficiary must prove against a dishonest assistant might loosely be termed
'wrongdoing', the nature of the remedy against a dishonest assistant has a different foundation from the remedy against a defendant liable for deceit or the procurement of a breach

of contract. The wrongdoing of a dishonest assistant is not the same as the wrongdoing of
the trustee or fiduciary. While the recovery of damages for an economic tort will be limited
by the principles of remoteness of damage so as to prevent a plaintiff recovering more than
that which is the reasonably foreseeable, natural and probable consequences of the tort,
a dishonest assistant's liability is derived from and replicates the liability of the primary
wrongdoer, the trustee,141 who is not usually able to take advantage of the principles of
remoteness to limit the amount of compensation needed to reconstitute the fund when
trust property has been misapplied.142

IV. The Liability of a Director of a Corporate
Trustee-'Dog-Leg' Claims
12-63

12-64

The office of trustee in Jersey is routinely being occupied by a corporate body, rather than
an individual. While adding an additional layer of complexity to the structuring of Jersey
trusts,143 the use of corporate rather than individual trustees has a profound impact on the
balance of economic risk in the provision of professional trustee services. Not only does
the use of a corporation entail limited liability for the shareholder(s) and directors of the
corporate trustee in the event that the corporate trustee is subject to a hostile claim by beneficiaries or a third party but the widespread use of, what are effectively, shell-companies as
Private Trust Companies (PTCs)144 means that while a PTC may legally be the entity that
bears most, if not all, of the legal liability for its actions (or omissions) as trustee, it can
often be very low on the list of prospective solvent defendants able to satisfy a judgment.
Where a breach of trust gives rise to a recoverable loss, who can be made to pay?
From its enactment until 1 January 2007 the Trusts (Jersey Law) 1984 contained the
following provision:
56 Liability of directors of a corporate trustee145
(1) This Article applies to a corporate trustee which, being constituted or operated for the purpose
of acting as a trustee (whether or not it is also constituted or operated for other purposes)-
(a) is a trustee of a Jersey trust; or
(b) is resident in Jersey; or
(c) is carrying on business in Jersey or from an address in Jersey.
(2) Where a breach of trust has been committed by a corporate trustee to which this Article applies,
every person who at the time of the commission of the breach of trust was a director of such
corporate trustee shall be deemed to be a guarantor of such corporate trustee in respect of any

pecuniary damages and costs awarded by the court against such corporate trustee in respect of
such breach:
Provided always that the Court may relieve a director either wholly or partly from personal liability
as a guarantor of such corporate trustee where it appears to the Court that he ought fairly to be
excused from such liability, because-
(a)

he has proved that he was not aware of such breach of trust being contemplated or
committed, and in being not so aware, was not behaving in a reckless or negligent
manner; or
(b) he expressly objected, and exercised such rights as he had by way of voting power or otherwise as a shareholder, director or other officer of the company so as to try to prevent the
commission of such breach of trust.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)-
(a)

'director' includes a person occupying the position of director by whatever name called, a
person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the corporation
or of a corporation of which it is a subsidiary (or any of them) are accustomed to act, and a
person who either alone or with or through an associate is entitled to exercise or control the
exercise of one third or more of the voting power at a general meeting of the corporation or
of a corporation of which it is a subsidiary;
(b) 'subsidiary' means a corporation in respect of which another corporation is entitled to exercise or can control the exercise of one third or more of the voting power;
(c) where used in this paragraph 'associate' in relation to a person means any relative, partner or
other person who is, has been or may be influenced by that person.

Those familiar with the position under English law will know that no equivalent provision
has ever existed. Despite its repeal from 1 January 2007, because of the way Article 57 of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law is structured, Article 56 still has the potential to visit liability on the
directors of a corporate trustee until 1 January 2028 (in a case of a non-fraudulent breach
of trust not falling with Article 57(1)) and potentially longer in cases of breaches of trust
falling within Article 57(1) which are by their nature imprescriptible.

12-65

A. General Position
Following the repeal of Article 56, the current position as to the incidence of liability of
a corporate trustee is as follows. If a corporate trustee commits a breach of trust, then
the corporate trustee is liable to the beneficiaries unless it has some defence against them.
Having satisfied that liability to the beneficiaries, the company may have a claim either
itself,146 or in some circumstances its shareholders,147 and, if the company is en désastre,
the Viscount may claim on the company's behalf,148 against directors who are in breach of

their duties to the company.149 The corporate trustee (or any of those able to act it its place
aforementioned) may make a claim against third parties who dishonestly assist the directors in the breach of their fiduciary duties to the company, where those who bring the claim
in the name of the company are not themselves parties to fraud.150 Where the company is
solvent the company will, but the beneficiaries will not, be concerned as to whether there
is a remedy against the directors; the beneficiaries' remedy against the corporate trustee
will usually be adequate.151 However, where the company has insufficient assets to meet the
beneficiaries' claim the beneficiaries will not have an effective claim against the corporate
trustee, and will have to consider whether they might have a claim against the directors who
caused the company to commit the breach of trust to meet any shortfall. This problem most
commonly arises with PTCs, specifically created for the sole purposes of acting as a trustee
of a single trust, the PTC itself having few, if any significant assets.152

B. Claim by Beneficiaries against Directors
12-67

The reason that beneficiaries cannot found a claim against the directors of a corporate
trustee for a breach of fiduciary duty by the directors to the beneficiaries is because no such
duty exists in law.153 Nor, in the absence of 'special circumstances', does such a direct duty
of care exist in tort154 or on the basis of piercing the corporate veil unless such grounds exist
for doing so.155 As has been said above, the beneficiaries may sue the directors of a corporate trustee who act dishonestly in causing the corporate trustee to commit or otherwise
assist the company to commit a breach of trust, but this is not a 'dog-leg' claim.156

C. A 'Dog-leg' Action
12-68

Taking its name from what we understand to be a golfing term involving negotiating an
approach down a crooked fairway, the 'dog-leg' action is based on the cause of action that
a corporate trustee may have against its directors for breach of their fiduciary duties to the

Brunei Airlines case, there was a difficulty in establishing liability in view of the previous requirement that the
breach of trust by the trustee must be a fraudulent and dishonest design, see §§ 40-017 to 40-023. Although
the problem might perhaps have been overcome by imputing the directors' knowledge and hence dishonesty
to the company under the principles mentioned in § 42-066, the problem was in fact overcome by treating a
fraudulent and dishonest design by the directors as being sufficient, see Baden v Société Général pour Favoriser le
Dévéloppement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA (n 53) at 573-74; Nimmo v Westpac Banking Corporation

'Dog-leg' Claims

477

company. A dog-leg claim is not in principle confined only to cases of dishonesty by the
defaulting directors. A 'dog-leg' claim involves the effective usurpation of the corporate
trustee's own claim against its directors by the beneficiaries of a trust, for the benefit of
the beneficiaries for whom the company is the corporate trustee. The beneficiaries' claim
is thus an indirect one against the directors of the corporate trustee. The argument goes
that the claims by the company against the directors are trust assets, which vest in the new
trustee when appointed in place of the company, so that the claims might be enforced by the
new trustee against the directors, or in the alternative where there has not been a transfer
to a new trustee, by the beneficiaries, by way of a derivative action. This argument has been
countered and, so far, put to bed in all reported decisions in which it has been raised on the
basis that it elides the assets of the company with the assets of the trust. The claims by the
company against the directors form part of the assets beneficially owned by the company.
They are not held in trust, and so the benefit of any claim against the directors passes to the
company's general creditors.157 This rebuttal of the argument in favour of a dog-leg claim
is particularly forceful where, as is common in Jersey, trusteeship is vested in a large corporate trustee which provides professional trust services to a large number of different trusts.
However, the rebuttal is not so forceful in the case of a breach of trust committed by a PTC
at the behest of its directors, the PTC having been established and administered solely for
the purpose of serving as trustee for a single trust and having no assets of its own. In these
circumstances, which in Jersey are quite common, special considerations may apply so as
to make it arguable that the claims against the directors beneficially belong to the trust,
thereby opening the door to an indirect or 'dog-leg' action by the beneficiaries against the
directors.158

D. Negligence Claims by Beneficiaries
If a trustee commits a breach of trust having acted on negligent advice given by the trustee's
professional advisers, then an action in contract or tort against the advisers is prima facie
only available to the trustee.159 An action may perhaps in special circumstances be brought
by a beneficiary claiming through the trustee.160 As under English law161 in Jersey law there
is no general tort of negligence in respect of economic loss. That has the effect of precluding
an action in negligence by beneficiaries against persons who assist in a breach of trust. The
beneficiary will have no direct action in negligence against the professional advisers unless
there has been an assumption of responsibility to the beneficiaries, or special circumstances
exist.162

V. Economic Torts163
12-70

12-71

12-72

Jersey law recognises the economic tort of conspiracy,164 and a claim in tort could in theory
be run in tandem with a claim based on dishonest assistance in the context of a commercial
fraud. However, the facts necessary to properly plead a dishonest assistance claim are not
coextensive with those necessary to make out a claim in conspiracy. Those constitutive elements are quite distinct and include i) a combination or agreement between two or more
individuals, ii) an intention, which (in cases other than unlawful means conspiracy) must
be proven to be the sole or predominant purpose of the combination to injure the plaintiff
and iii) the act carried out that caused loss or damage the plaintiff pursuant to the combination or agreement and with the requisite intention. There is no need for a plaintiff to
prove either a combination or a sole or predominant intention on the part of the assistant
to make out a claim in dishonest assistance. Immediately it can be seen that proof of the
mental element necessary to properly make out a claim in conspiracy is far more exacting that applicable to dishonest assistance with the former being concerned with the conspirator's subjective intent which may be sufficient but is not necessary to satisfy the test
of dishonesty. An inquiry into and determination of the assistant's subjective view about
the honesty of what he was assisting in is not required.165 The native Jersey jurisprudence
on conspiracy is not well developed and there are few reported Jersey decisions. As a cause
of action in the context of trust disputes, conspiracy is not routinely used as a remedy for
beneficiaries in relation to agreements to commit breaches of trust.
The tort of procuring a breach of contract166 no doubt has a potential application in a case
where a particular transaction creates both a contract and a trust, such as with a Quistclose
trust,167 and the breach of contract which is procured also happens to amount to a breach
of trust, and the party to the contract who is prejudiced by the breach also happens to be
the beneficiary. However, the tort is not a perfect fit in that in reality it is the inducement
of the breach of trust that is being complained about so as to make recourse to the tort
unnecessary. The tort is not confined to inducement of a breach of contract, and extends to
inducement of breach of other obligations, including equitable obligations. But the tort has
been held, in England at least,168 not to extend to inducement of a breach of trust since the
equitable accessory liability, then based on Barnes v Addy,169 made adequate provision of a
remedy without needing to extend the tort.
We doubt whether the Royal Court would be prepared to extend the scope of tort to include
procurement of a breach of trust/dishonest assistance cases where, as is the case, the modern
cause of action of dishonest assistance usually suffices. A further objection to the tort would
also be that it might provide a means to visit liability on an accessory while circumventing

the requirement to prove dishonesty (which is not a requirement of the tortious liability).
However, as we have discussed dishonest assistance has not (yet) been developed to be
available where there has been assistance in the breach of a fiduciary relationship which
does not relate to property.170 Were the facts of a case to fall between the two stools of
­dishonest assistance and a claim in conspiracy, the tort of inducement of a breach of
contract might be argued to apply so as to fill that gap in the available remedies.
It seems to us doubtful whether the torts of causing loss by unlawful means171 or
intimidation172 have any ready application to this area of trust disputes litigated in Jersey.
That is because the breach of trust which the trustee is intimidating or caused by unlawful
means to commit is not something that the trustee is otherwise permitted to do. The facts
that could support a claim in tort for causing loss by unlawful means or intimidation could
conceivably meet the requirements of dishonest assistance (the assistance being the instigation or inducement of the breach of trust), particularly when considering the objective
element of the test for dishonesty and the emphasis, as shown in Nolan v Minerva Trust, on
the commercially unacceptable nature of a defendant's behaviour.

12-73

VI. Derivative Claims by Beneficiaries
In Jersey law, as in English law, a trustee administers a trust as principal, not as agent for
the beneficiaries, and so the trustee is normally the proper plaintiff in proceedings brought
on behalf of the trust against agents and other third parties in actions based on breach
of contract or tort, and other causes of action arising in the course of administration of
the trust. Normally beneficiaries have no personal cause of action173 against the agents
of the trustees,174 though sometimes beneficiaries may bring a derivative claim on behalf of
the trustee. There is no requirement in the Royal Court Rules 2004 for beneficiaries to be
joined as co-plaintiffs (or defendants); the trustee will usually represent the trust.175 If one
or more co-trustees refuses to be joined as a plaintiff, or if there are special reasons for his
not being a plaintiff, for example because the trustee is implicated in the loss which is the
subject matter of the action, then he should be joined as a defendant.176
Jersey's trust law does not have an equivalent of section 40(1) of the Trustee Act 1925,
whereby a cause of action automatically vests in new trustees upon compliance with that
section. It follows that for a cause of action to vest in new trustees, it must be expressly
assigned. The Code of 1771 prohibits the assignment of matters that are already in

litigation.177 It follows that if, following the commencement of proceedings, there is
a change in trustee, there is no mechanism to substitute the new trustee for the old as­
plaintiff and have the outgoing trustee disjoined from the proceedings.178 Where there is to
be a transfer of trusteeship and litigation on behalf of the trust is contemplated, the transfer
of trusteeship should be completed before the proceedings are served.179
Where the claim is for a breach of duty by a director of a former corporate trustee
(ie a 'dog-leg claim' the locus of the new trustee to sue the director of the outgoing trustee
will turn upon whether the benefit of the cause of action vested in the company against the
director constitutes 'trust property' vested in the new trustee. This involves ensuring that
the outgoing trustee assigns its right to sue the director to the new incoming trustee. We
have already discussed the scope of a 'dog-leg' claim in Jersey. While such a claim is usually
not viable where the breach of duty by the director does not relate to a particular trust, or
particular item of trust property,180 it remains arguable that the cause of action is 'trust
property' for these purposes where the former corporate trustee was trustee of only one
trust, so that the breach of duty can only relates to that trust.181

A. Administration Action by Beneficiaries
12-77

If the trustees fail to pursue a claim which is vested in them in that capacity, then a
beneficiary may commence an administration action by way of Representation under
­Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 against the trustee for an order compelling it to
take proceedings to enforce the claim.182 If a serious question arises as to whether or not
the trustee ought to sue, then the Court will determine the question in accordance with
the principles applicable to Beddoe proceedings. If the Court in the administration action
is satisfied that the claim ought to be brought, then it may direct the trustees to sue or give
liberty to the beneficiary to use the trustee's name to sue the third party.

B. Derivative Action by Beneficiaries
12-78

As an alternative to the usual position whereby proceedings are brought in the name of
the trustee, a beneficiary may sometimes bring an action in his name on behalf of the trust
against a third party.183 The character of an action does not change because it is brought by
the beneficiary rather than the trustee. The beneficiary stands in the shoes of the trustees
and sues in right of the trust, as the trustee would have done. The beneficiary does not
enforce duties owed to him but duties owed to the trustee: as such, a beneficiary can be in

no better position than the trustee.184 The Court has an inherent jurisdiction to grant the
equivalent Beddoe style protective cost order in favour of a beneficiary who undertakes
a derivative action.185 A derivative action cannot be brought by a beneficiary against the
professional advisers of the trustees in tort if the cause of action in tort is not trust property.186 Usually, if liability has arisen in the administration of the trust, such a claim will
constitute trust property,187 thereby enabling the beneficiary to sue if the requisite special
circumstances are established as explained below.188

C. Need for Special Circumstances to Bring a Derivative Action
The special circumstances in which a beneficiary can bring a derivative action arise
only where the trustee is disabled from suing itself (such as where their acts and conduct with reference to the trust fund are impeached or where there is a conflict between
their interest and duty).189 However, the list of special circumstances is not closed.190
The guiding p
­ rinciple is that there must be exceptional circumstances which give rise
to a failure (whether or not excusable) by the trustees to perform their duties to protect
the trust, or to protect the interest of the beneficiaries in the trust property.191 Where the
trustee refuses to sue, that will not usually in itself count as a special circumstance justifying an action being brought in a beneficiary's name.192 The key threshold will be whether,
had the beneficiaries brought administrative action for an order compelling the trustee
to sue, the trustee would have been so directed.193 If the trustee is given leave to discontinue194 an action already brought on the ground that the trust assets are insufficient to
fund the future costs of the action and any adverse cost order it might be ordered to satisfy were the action to fail, a beneficiary cannot rely upon the lack of money in the fund
as a special circumstance justifying an order that a beneficiary can carry on the action
as a derivative action in the place of the trustees.195 The trustee's refusal to sue, so as to

If there is a dispute between the beneficiaries as to whether an action against a third party
would be in the interests of the trust, then an administrative action should be brought so
that the matter might be determined as between the beneficiaries before proceedings are
commenced in the name of any of them or in the name of the trustee.

E. Need for Joinder of Trustees as Defendants
12-81

Where a beneficiary brings a derivative action in his own name, the trustee should be joined
as defendant if it will not consent to be joined as a plaintiff.197 The need for joinder of
the trustee as a defendant is not a matter of procedural nicety since the beneficiary has
no ­personal right to sue and is suing on behalf of the trustee.198

F. Do Other Beneficiaries Need to Be Joined to a Derivative Action?
12-82

Other beneficiaries should be joined as parties where this is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of actions or where it is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the
cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.199
A derivative action arguably comes within r 4/3 RCR 2004, so as to make a judgment
binding on the beneficiaries notwithstanding they are not named as parties, on the basis
that the trustees represent the beneficiaries and the plaintiff is standing in the shoes
of the trustee. Alternatively it could be argued that, once the trustees have been joined
as defendants in their capacity as such, the claim comes within r 4/5 RCR 2004200 and,
although though the trustee will not take an active part in the proceedings, the beneficiary stands in the shoes of the trustees. As such, the same practice, so far as it being
unnecessary to join the beneficiaries is concerned, should be applied as if the trustees
were the plaintiffs, especially where the beneficiaries are numerous or include minor,
unborn or unascertained persons.201 Should directions be sought to ascertain the views
of the other beneficiaries to a prospective derivative action? If there has been no B

application or administration action in relation to the claim, and there are other beneficiaries with substantial interests who may be prejudiced by the claim, eg because, notwithstanding the lack of a Beddoe order, the trust assets are vulnerable to an adverse
costs order were the claim to fail, then there is a good argument that a procedure should
be devised for canvassing the views of the other beneficiaries in a similar way to the Beddoe procedure. The views of the other beneficiaries to a derivative action will be important when the Court considers (as it must) the financial impact of bringing the action
on the trust, in particular the vulnerability of the trust to an adverse costs order if the
action fails.202 A trust is vulnerable to such an order, and even if there are no assets apart
from the claim, the trustee may be personally vulnerable, since its liability to pay costs in
third party claims is not limited to the trust assets.203 And so, where there are doubts as
to the beneficiary's ability to meet a costs order if the claim fails, the other beneficiaries
may object to a derivative action if they would be prejudiced by an adverse costs order
being met from trust assets.

VII. Claims for Breach of Duty in Relation
to Companies in which the Trust Has an
Interest-Claims for Reflective Loss
The most authoritative statement of the principle of reflective loss in both Jersey and
England is to be found in the decision of the House of Lords in Johnson v GoreWood & Co:204
1.

A company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its shareholders. It has its own
assets and liabilities and its own creditors. The company's property belongs to the company and not to its shareholders. If the company has a cause of action, this is a legal
chose in action which represents part of its assets.
Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty owed to it, only the company may sue in respect of that loss. No action lies at the suit of a shareholder suing
in that capacity and no other to make good a diminution in the value of the shareholder's shareholding where that merely reflects the loss suffered by the company. A
claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made good if the
company's assets were replenished through action against the party responsible for
the loss, even if the company, acting through its constitutional organs, has declined or
failed to make good that loss.
Where a company suffers loss but has no cause of action to sue to recover that loss,
the shareholder in the company may sue in respect of it (if the shareholder has a

cause of action to do so), even though the loss is a diminution in the value of the
shareholding.
Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty owed to it, and a shareholder
suffers a loss separate and distinct from that suffered by the company caused by breach
of a duty independently owed to the shareholder, each may sue to recover the loss
caused to it by breach of the duty owed to it but neither may recover loss caused to the
other by breach of the duty owed to that other.

In each case what falls to be scrutinised is whether the loss claimed appears to be or is one
which would be made good if the company had enforced its full rights against the party
responsible, and whether the loss claimed is 'merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the
company'.205 In some cases the answer will be clear, as where the shareholder claims the loss
of dividend or a diminution in the value of a shareholding attributable solely to depletion
of the company's assets.
The principle of reflective loss is not engaged where the company has a cause of action and
the shareholder has none; or where the shareholder has a cause of action and the company
has none. Where the company suffers loss as a result of a wrong to the shareholder but has
no cause of action in respect of its loss, the shareholder can sue and recover damages for his
own loss, whether of a capital or income nature, measured by the diminution in the value
of his shareholding. The shareholder must, of course, show that he has an independent
cause of action of his own and that he has suffered personal loss caused by the defendant's
actionable wrong. Since the company itself has no cause of action in respect of its loss,
its assets are not depleted by the recovery of damages by the shareholder. The position is
different where the company suffers loss caused by the breach of a duty owed both to the
company and to the shareholder. In such a case the shareholder's loss, in so far as this is
measured by the diminution in value of his shareholding or the loss of dividends, merely
reflects the loss suffered by the company in respect of which the company has its own cause
of action. If the shareholder is allowed to recover in respect of such loss, then either there
will be double recovery at the expense of the defendant or the shareholder will recover at
the expense of the company and its creditors and other shareholders. Neither course can
be permitted. This is a matter of principle; there is no discretion involved. Justice to the
defendant requires the exclusion of one claim or the other; protection of the interests of
the company's creditors requires that it is the company which is allowed to recover to the
exclusion of the shareholder.206
Jersey law does recognise the principle of reflective loss as essentially a reaffirmation and
explanation of the rule in Foss v Harbottle207 to the effect that the proper plaintiff in respect
of loss suffered by a company as a result of a wrong done to the company is the company
itself and not its shareholder(s).208 As we will see, the Royal Court has expressed more
doubt209 as to the principle's applicability in the context of a claim by a beneficiary against
a trustee of a discretionary trust.

Claims for Reflective Loss

485

The usual measure of loss is the diminution in the value of the shares in the company210 or
of a direct or indirect subsidiary of that company.211 The defendant to an action bears the
onus of establishing that the loss sought to be recovered is subject to the reflective loss principle, by showing not merely that the company has a cause of action of its own to recover
the claimed loss but also that such a claim is available to it on the facts.212
The reflective loss principle applies to preclude a claim by the shareholder of the company even though the company that has suffered the loss chooses not to pursue its own
claim,213 compromises the claim,214 or the company's claim becomes time barred.215 Would
a ­beneficiary's claim be struck out by reason of the reflective loss principle from making
a claim against the trustee if any of these circumstances applied? In the case of a company's claim becoming barred by limitation, the rationale for exclusion of recovery of reflective loss is not that it is needed to prevent double recovery or to protect the company's
creditors, but that the shareholder's loss has been caused by the company's failure to pursue
its claim in time.216 If the company itself has no claim against anyone for allowing the claim
to become time barred, then the company's shareholder, whether directly or through the
company, can have no claim against anyone either. However, the beneficiaries will still have
a claim against the trustees on a loss of chance basis for having allowed the company's claim
to become time barred. That claim is not caught by the reflective loss principle because that
is not the company's claim.
There is English Court of Appeal authority217 (which does not have universal acclaim
because it encroaches upon the rationale that a claim for reflective loss by shareholders is
harmful to the interests of a company's creditors),218 that the reflective loss principle does
not apply if the defendant's conduct is such as to prevent the company from pursuing its
own claim by denuding it of funds.219 This may be the case where the directors of the company are all employees or directors of the trustee and, because of their position, either no
consideration is given to the company making a claim against the directors or the company
is positively prevented from doing so.
What has been accepted in Jersey law is the principle that where the company is wholly
owned by the trust, and the trustees as its sole shareholders authorise the company to enter
into a transaction which prejudices the company and which, apart from such authority would have generated a claim by the company against the directors or others, the

Royal Court is free to follow or disregard the decision in Giles v Rhind (n 216).
219 The alternative course in such a situation is not to circumvent the reflective loss principle by allowing a
shareholder a cause of action but by pursuing a derivative claim, so as to step into the company's own shoes and
sue on its behalf on its cause of action.

beneficiaries may maintain a claim against the trustees since the company has never had a
claim at all and therefore no the reflective loss principle is not engaged at all.220
The importance of the application of the reflective loss principle to a trust dispute arises
because the structure that practitioners will encounter time and again in many Jersey trusts
is that of a trustee (usually a corporation) vested directly or indirectly with the shares of an
underlying company which itself holds the individual trust assets. At trust level, the only
directly held trust assets are the shares in the holding company. Typically, the directors of
the wholly owned company will be the same employees of the corporate trustee who are
responsible for administering the affairs of the trust. A strict application of the reflective
loss principle would preclude the beneficiaries in a breach of trust claim from recovering
the diminution in the value of the trust shareholding caused by a breach of duty by the
trustee as a director of the company concerned for which the company has a claim against
the director.
The question whether the principle of reflective loss qualifies for different treatment in a
trust context arises because the following circumstances will usually exist which may not
exist in the classic application of the principle against a shareholder. The first important
difference is that the plaintiff in a trust dispute will not be shareholders in the company
concerned (or indeed its parent company), but will be beneficiaries of the trust with a
beneficial interest in a trust fund comprising those shares. Secondly, the defendants to such
a claim will not necessarily be the same as those against whom the company has a claim.
The beneficiaries' claim will be against the trustees while the company's claim will usually
be against one or more of its directors. Only where there is an identity between the trustees
and the directors against whom the company has a claim can it be said that the defendants
to both claims will be the same. It is, however, not clear from either the Jersey or English the
authorities whether the reflective loss principle only applies to cases where the defendants
to both claims are the same.221
If the company sustains a loss, on the basis of the principles discussed above, the loss is the
company's, not the trust's and the beneficiaries cannot sue the trustee for that loss. While
the directors of the company will be appointed by the trustee, and will usually be employees of the trustee, the beneficiaries are usually also unable to sue the directors for breach
of their duties because the directors owe the beneficiaries no duties qua directors.222 The
position should be contrasted with a situation where the investments are held directly by
the trustee. The beneficiaries' remedy in such a case is simple. They may sue the trustee
for breach of trust in making imprudent investments and seek the reconstitution of the

220 Note the distinction drawn in Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand (n 214) at [113]-[125] and [128] between
the defendant having a defence to the company's claim and the company having no claim at all; and note Re Gee &
Co (Woolwich) Ltd [1975] Ch 52 at 71D on the effect of shareholder approval. See Freeman v Ansbacher Trustees
(Jersey) Ltd [2009] JRC 003 also at [79].
221 The lack of identity of defendants was one of the reasons given in Walker v Stones (n 104) at 933, why the
beneficiaries' loss was separate and distinct from the company's loss. In Gardner v Parker [2004] EWCA Civ 781,
however, Neuberger LJ considered, at [52], in relation to a case of lack of identity of defendants posited at [38], that
it might well be that the reflective loss principle may apply even in relation to trustees against whom the company
had no claim. See too Freeman v Ansbacher Trustees (Jersey) Ltd (n 219) at [97(vi)], where the point was discussed,
but not decided.

Claims for Reflective Loss

trust fund. If, on the other hand, the investments have been made through a wholly owned
company and the reflective loss principle applies, such an action cannot be brought. From
the beneficiaries' perspective and as a matter of practical consequence there is no difference
between the situation where the trustee holds the trust investments directly and where it to
does so through a company wholly owned by the trust and yet if the reflective loss principle
applies, the beneficiaries are without a remedy in the latter case but not in the former simply because of the structure that is used.
The twin rationale that underpins the reflective loss principle is to eliminate the risk of
double recovery (ie if both the company and the shareholder can sue for the wrong done
by the defendant, the defendant may have to pay twice for what is ultimately the same
loss), and secondly, that the company's assets are preserved in the interests of its creditors
so that their claims takes precedence over the claims of persons interested in its shares.223
The reflective loss principle ensures that the monies recovered will not be paid directly
to the shareholder but are instead company funds, made available to the company's
creditors. The reflective loss principle also appears to prevent beneficiaries claiming
against a dishonest assistant of the directors of the company in misappropriating the company's assets.224
The reflective loss principle, as it applies to discretionary trusts, was only considered for
the first time relatively in Freeman v Ansbacher Trustees (Jersey) Limited.225 The report
concerns whether a claim by a beneficiary of a discretionary trust to sue the former trustee
for negligence in its management of an underlying company was liable to be struck out. As
such, the Court was only asked to consider whether the claim surmounted the relatively
low threshold of reasonable prospect of success. A degree of caution should therefore be
adopted in considering what can be taken from Ansbacher to be the current state of Jersey
law. The Court concluded that the claim would not be struck out, emphasising that the
scope of the reflective loss principle was unclear and that it was reluctant to strike out
a claim in a developing area of jurisprudence but that it was strongly arguable that the
reflective loss principle had no application in Jersey law where a discretionary beneficiary
was seeking reconstitution of the trust fund because of a failure by the trustee to supervise
the investments of a wholly owned company for a variety of reasons of legal principle and
policy.226
Prominent among these was a practical concern that if the reflective loss principle
precluded a beneficiary from suing the trustee, that created a lacuna in the practical remedies available to beneficiaries, which was undesirable given Jersey's status as a leading offshore jurisdiction in respect of trusts. The dramatic distinction in consequences that flowed
from whether the trust assets were held directly by the trustee or via an intermediary holding company was an unsustainable and seemingly artificial distinction, especially where the
company is likely to be administered by employees of the trustee. Neither was it desirable

to direct beneficiaries down the tangential rabbit hole of seeking the removal of a trustee
who refuses to resign in the face of the inevitable conflict of interest in having to sue its
own appointees as directors, with the additional cost associated with the appointment of a
new trustee and any applications for Beddoe relief or directions in respect of the claim to
recover the losses.
It has been held strongly arguable that these twin rationales set out above are not undermined in the trust context where what is sought is the reconstitution of the trust fund
by a discretionary beneficiary.227 The Court went further to suggest that it was strongly
arguable that the reflective loss principle could be disregarded entirely in the context of a
claim by a discretionary beneficiary where neither of the two underlying rationales for it
are applicable.
The bases upon which this was said to be strongly arguable are, first, that the claim by
a discretionary beneficiary (having no vested interest in the fund that is sought to be
­reconstituted) does not personally benefit from the recovery and is therefore not analogous
to a shareholder recovering the company's loss for itself personally so as to deprive the
company's creditors of the fruits of the action. Secondly, because of the nature of the relief
sought in reconstituting the Court could mould the relief to suit the circumstances of the
case. In the event of the breaches of trust being proved, the Court could order the trustee to
reconstitute the fund by reimbursing that particular part of the fund which had been primarily affected by the breach of trust. Thus, the Court could order Ansbacher to reimburse
the underlying company from where the funds had been lost in the first place. Alternatively,
the Court could direct the trustee, as a term of the relief that the funds were to be used to
acquire new assets in the company's name, so that the funds would eventually find their
way onto the company's balance sheet, raising the value of those shares. This latter solution would have the effect of exactly reconstituting the trust fund because it would take the
value of the shares in the underlying company back to what they had been previously and
the financial position of the company back to what it had been. Such remedies may not be
available in all cases but are likely to be available where the company in question is wholly
owned by a discretionary trust. It follows that the company will have been reimbursed and
will therefore no longer have suffered any loss. Accordingly it may no longer bring any claim
against its directors, thereby precluding a risk of double recovery. Secondly, because the
moneys will have been replaced into the underlying company, there is no prejudice to any
creditor as they will be in the same position as they were prior to the wrongful investments
which gave rise to the breaches of trust.

A. Conclusions
12-99

Notwithstanding the considerations the then Bailiff thought to be 'strongly arguable' in
severely narrowing the application of the reflective loss principle in relation to trust disputes, the continuing dearth of authority in Jersey means there continues to be uncertainty
as to the precise application of the reflective loss principle in relation to trusts. Strictly
speaking, the reflective loss principle does not bar causes of action but only the recoverabil227

ibid, at [97(iv)] and [97(v)].

Claims for Reflective Loss

ity of certain types of loss. Arguably the principle should be confined to cases where without it the beneficiaries and the company could recover the same damages from the trustee/
directors of the company.228 Beneficiaries may be well advised, in a case where the company
does or may have a claim in respect of the subject matter of the loss, to consider the prospects of a claim by the company against its directors rather than a claim from the other
end of the structure, ie by them against the trustee. This may be the most expedient course
where, as is very common in Jersey, the trust contains an 'anti-Bartlett'229 clause with the
effect of impeding a claim by the beneficiaries against the trustees for failing to ensure the
company was properly managed. An 'anti-Bartlett' clause will not preclude a claim by the
company against the directors, whether or not also the trustees (or associated with them).
That said, this may well be easier said than done. The beneficiaries will be strangers to the
company's internal corporate governance structure and there is no obvious ­mechanism
by which the beneficiaries can force the issue. It will be the trustee as the company's
­shareholder, rather than the beneficiaries, that has the power to cause the company to bring
proceedings. Where the directors are employees or associates of the trustee, the trustee may
prove obstructive to a claim. Where the trustee places itself in a position of conflict like this,
appropriate trust proceedings can be brought by the beneficiaries under Article 51 of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (convening the trustee) for directions to be given to the trustee
to ensure either that the requisite proceedings are taken by the company, that the trustee is
removed (if it refuses to acknowledge its conflicted position and resign) or the trustees
concede that the company has no claim so that no reflective loss defence can subsequently
be raised against the beneficiaries by the trustee. Where there has been a diminution in
the value of the assets held by an underlying company, the shares of which are vested in
the trustee, the first question is to consider whether there is a claim against the trustee for
failing to consider or use its powers as shareholders of the company to properly supervise
the company's management.

Proprietary Remedies against
Trustees and Third Parties
I. Introduction-Tracing in Jersey
This chapter is concerned with the ability of beneficiaries of a trust (or a trustee on their
behalf) to assert a proprietary remedy which vindicates the beneficiaries' continuing beneficial interest in property that has been misapplied in breach of trust or in circumstances
which have given rise to a constructive trust. This chapter should therefore be read in conjunction with Chapter 6 as to the applicable legal principles by which a constructive trust
arises in Jersey law. The proprietary remedy extents to claims against the original property
(if it remains in its original form) or property representing the original property, whether
in the hands of a trustee who has appropriated the property in a breach of trust, or in certain circumstances against a third party into whose hands that property has come. Owing to
the different historical basis upon which the courts of England and Jersey have approached
their respective jurisdictions to grant equitable remedies, Jersey has not followed England
in preserving what is now (even in English law) a technical and increasingly arcane distinction between following at common law and tracing in equity.1 While the approach in Jersey
and England is closely aligned in many respects, in certain important respects they should
not be regarded as identical and while English law is likely to inform how the Royal Court
will approach proprietary remedies, where Jersey's rules differ this is highlighted. Somewhat surprisingly, there have only been a handful of significant decisions of the Royal Court
and Jersey Court of Appeal on the nature and extent of the proprietary remedies available
where assets subject to a trust have been misappropriated. This has resulted in a number of
unsatisfactory lacunae in Jersey's law. Where there are gaps, the more extensively developed
jurisprudence from the onshore jurisdictions such as England, Australia and New Zealand
and even North America may be persuasive.

1 Federal Republic of Brazil and Anor v Durant International Corporation and Anor [2013] JCA 071 at [51]:
'In short, the law of Jersey should and does recognise tracing. In particular, it should and does recognise tracing as
a unitary concept, unencumbered by the burden of history which has complicated the position in England with
separate rules of equitable and common law tracing'.

Proprietary Remedies

II. Terminology Relevant to Proprietary Remedies
and Tracing in Jersey Trust Litigation
A. Following
13-2

A trustee may, in breach of trust, misapply trust assets so as to either appropriate them to
itself or to part with them contrary to the terms of the trust by transferring them to a third
party. Indeed, the assets may have passed, in specie, along a chain of third parties to the
trust before the breach comes to the attention of the beneficiaries. If the beneficiary wishes
to assert a beneficial interest in a particular asset then it is necessary first and foremost for
the beneficiaries to be able to follow it as it passes along such a chain. The process of following is that by which the same asset, in specie, is followed as it moves from hand to hand.2
Jersey does not observe a strict distinction between following at common law and tracing
in equity. In Re The Esteem Settlement3 it was said:
The rules to be applied should, as a starting point, be those established in English law. However, the
court is not bound by any English rule of tracing and is free to depart from such a rule if convinced
that there is a better alternative. When we talk of the rules of tracing, we are, for the purposes of this
case, speaking of the rules of equitable tracing because we are dealing with an equitable proprietary
interest […]. There is much debate in England as to whether the time has come for the commonlaw tracing rules to be subsumed into the more flexible rules of equitable tracing. In particular, this
would allow tracing through a mixed fund. We have not heard argument on this and therefore offer
no definitive view. We express the preliminary view, however, that the differences between the two
systems of tracing in England have an historical origin which has no application in Jersey. On the
face of it, there would seem to be little reason to incorporate such technical distinctions into Jersey
law and there would seem to be some advantage in applying the more flexible rules of equitable
tracing (as constituting the Jersey rules of tracing) to all tracing actions.4

B. Purchase without Notice
13-3

In the vast majority of cases, the process of following a misapplied asset subject to a trust is
of very limited practical utility. Following relies on, first, being able to identify the person
into whose hands the trust asset has passed (and who, even if identified, may not practically
be capable of being subject to the jurisdiction of the Royal Court to restore the trust property) and, secondly, assuming the property is still readily identifiable, following relies upon
the property not having passed to into the hands of 'equity's darling'; a bona fides purchaser
for value without notice.5 While it may still be possible to follow the property, a bona fides

[2002 JLR.53] at 105.

5 A bona fides purchaser for value may deal with a trustee in relation to trust property as if the trustee was the
beneficial owner of the trust property; and shall not be affected by any trusts on which such property is held unless
he has actual notice of it. Constructive notice is insufficient; Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 55.
3

Terminology

493

purchase for value without notice effectively extinguishes the beneficiary's prior interest in
whatever property they have purchased. A receiver of property who is a purchaser without
notice that the property is subject to a prior beneficial interest therefore has an iron-clad
defence to any proprietary claim by the beneficiary.

C. Tracing
Even if the asset subject to a trust has passed to a bone fides purchaser for value without
notice, while the original property may be wiped clean of any prior beneficial proprietary interest, it may still be represented by any property, including purchase money, that
is exchanged for the trust property that remains in the hands of a wrongdoer in another
form.6 The beneficiary's proprietary interest in this substituted property is preserved even
though the original asset has passed beyond the reach of a proprietary claim. A similar
exercise is possible where the original asset has been exchanged for another without the
interposition of a bona fides purchaser for value in the chain. So for example, where a trustee misapplies trust money in breach of trust and purchases shares or securities with the
money, the original money may have gone but the proprietary remedy is available against
the shares; they represent and are the substitute for the original trust money. The process by
which a new asset is identified as the substitute for the old in both Jersey and English law is
called tracing.7 Tracing is a conceptually distinct exercise from following.8 It is the inherent
value in the original trust asset that is traced and not the physical asset itself.9 It is not possible to both follow the original asset and to trace the proceeds of sale of the original asset
so as to end up asserting a proprietary claim over the inherent value twice over; that would
amount to an impermissible double recovery.10

6 A 'purchaser' for 'value' will usually have conveyed something in exchange for the property he has acquired
which can still be the subject of a tracing exercise in support of a proprietary claim.
7 Foskett v McKeown (n 2) at 127B.
8 In re Esteem Settlement [2002 JLR 53] at [93]. The classic statement of Lord Millett in Foskett v McKeown
(n 2) distinguishes the concepts of 'following', 'tracing' and 'claiming' in the following terms:
The processes of following and tracing are, however, distinct. Following is the process of following the same
asset as it moves from hand to hand. Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as the substitute for the old.
Where one asset is exchanged for another, a claimant can elect whether to follow the original asset into the hands
of the new owner or to trace its value into the new asset in the hands of the same owner. The rules of following and
tracing are evidential in nature and are concerned with identifying property in the hands of another or property
that has assumed another form…Tracing is thus neither a claim nor a remedy. It is merely the process by which
a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his property, identifies its proceeds and the persons who have
handled or received them, and justifies his claim that the proceeds can properly be regarded as representing his
property. Tracing is also distinct from claiming. It identifies the traceable proceeds of the claimant's property. It
enables the claimant to substitute the traceable proceeds for the original asset as the subject matter of his claim.
But it does not affect or establish his claim. That will depend on a number of factors including the nature of his
interest in the original asset. He will normally be able to maintain the same claim to the substituted asset as he
could have maintained to the original asset. If he held only a security interest in the original asset, he cannot claim
more than a security interest in its proceeds. But his claim may also be exposed to potential defences as a result of
intervening transactions.

Proprietary Remedies

D. Recovery
13-5

Tracing and following are not in themselves either remedies or causes of action.11 Both are
merely evidential processes which provide the means to identify an asset or an individual
that can then be subject to either a propriety or personal claim.12 The process of tracing
is relevant to proprietary as well as personal equitable remedies (such as an obligation to
account 'as a constructive trustee'), for example where trust property is applied in breach
of trust and traced into other property that is handled or received by a defendant against
whom a claim is brought for knowing receipt.

E. Clean and Mixed Substitutions
13-6

Tracing is concerned with the identification of a substitution of one asset for another. Where
the inherent value that is represented in a new asset is wholly attributable to the inherent
value in the old one that amounts to a clean substitution. However, in many cases, where the
whole of the value inherent in the new asset is not attributable wholly to the original asset,
but is comprised in part from another source; that is described as a mixed substitution.
Where there has been a mixed substitution it is necessary for the plaintiff to identify what
assets are attributable to them to enable tracing to take place.13

III. Proprietary Remedy
13-7

The process of tracing is a means by which beneficiaries (or trustees on their behalf) are
able to assert and vindicate their continuing beneficial interest in trust assets which have
been misapplied in breach of trust, or in assets representing them.14 It is a precondition
for the availability of a proprietary remedy to first establish that the property sought to
be traced is subject to a trust and that the property has been misapplied in breach of that
trust.15 If these preconditions are satisfied then a proprietary remedy is available not only
against the trustee in respect of the trust asset that has been applied in breach of trust still in
the hands of the trustee or in respect of assets into which those assets are traceable, but also
against any other person into whose hands those assets are followed or in whose hands their
inherent value is traced, other than a bona fides purchaser for value without actual notice.

Proprietary Remedy

495

A. The Trust to which the Traceable Property Is Subject
The trust to which property must be subject in the first place is not confined to express
trusts, but can include any property which at the outset is the subject of a fiduciary
relationship.16 Thus the person in the position of a director who defrauds the company of
which he is a director holds the proceeds on constructive trust for the company, which has
an equitable proprietary interest in the property in question.17 A beneficiary of a constructive trust arising under Article 33 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 has a proprietary interest
in the assets thereof sufficient to bring a proprietary claim.18 Where property is obtained by
fraud, equity will declare the property to be subject to a constructive trust in favour of the
victim of the fraud.19 An object of a discretionary power has a sufficient proprietary interest in a misapplied trust asset to mount a tracing exercise even though his entitlement to
the property which is subject to the trust is only to be considered as a possible object of the
trustee's discretionary power of appointment.20

13-8

B. The Breach of Trust
If a trust asset has been distributed in accordance with the terms of a validly exercised
power of advancement or appointment in the trust, any subsisting proprietary interest in
the property advanced or appointed that might be vindicated by way of a proprietary claim
will have been extinguished. A trustee who enters into a contract for the sale of trust assets
(assuming this is a transaction within his powers), but fails to chase the purchase money or
obtain the best possible price, is very likely to still be effective to overreach the beneficiaries'
interests in the assets provided that a proper discharge is given in respect of any purchase
moneys so that there should no question of the purchaser taking the property subject to
the trusts and powers in favour of the beneficiaries, even if the recipient was aware that the
trustee might have done better for his beneficiaries had he negotiated more vigorously.21
A transaction in which a trustee abuses his power of sale by selling or dealing with trust
property for an improper purpose, or by deliberately selling at a gross undervalue, would
prima facie be ineffective in equity save in favour of a bona fides purchaser for value without notice. A recipient with actual notice or who is not acting bona fides could be subject
to a proprietary remedy against the property in his hands or a personal action for knowing
receipt.22

Proprietary Remedies

C. Breach of Trust and Proprietary Constructive Trusts
13-10

While establishing the existence of a trust and a breach of it will usually be two actual
and conceptually separate steps in the case of the misappropriation of assets subject to
an express trust or fiduciary relationship with the latter following the former, in the case
of a proprietary constructive trust23 the breach and the constitution of the trust will arise
simultaneously.24 In this instance the beneficiary must establish the constructive trust and
then pursue the proprietary remedy in relation to the asset which it is alleged is subject to
the constructive trust or any substitute property that represents it. Where an asset becomes
subject to a constructive trust under the no-profit rule,25 the beneficiary must establish the
necessary facts giving rise a breach of fiduciary duty which causes the asset to become subject to a constructive trust under the rule in order for a proprietary remedy to be capable of
being asserted against that asset or any asset into which it is traceable.26

D. Evidence to Establish what Property or Money Is Subject to the
Proprietary Remedy: General Principle in Relation to Trustee
13-11

Where a trustee mixes money subject to a trust of which he is a trustee, with his own money,
the rule in English law, but perhaps not in Jersey, is that the beneficiary will be entitled to
assert a proprietary remedy against every portion of the mixed fund which the trustee cannot prove to be his own.27 While the principle in Jersey law is that there should be a 'clear
link' between the plaintiff property and the assets in the hands of the wrongdoer, a tracing
exercise should not fail because the wrongdoer has acted particularly dishonestly or cunningly by creating a maelstrom of transactions in which it becomes difficult, if not impossible to identify the source of the funds.28 Perhaps mindful of the fact that a defendant trustee
should not be able to benefit by creating a flurry of transactions so as to obfuscate the ability of a plaintiff to follow the path of the money and of the need to avoid a perception that
Jersey affords any safe harbour to fraudsters or those who seek to hide money from those
who have a legitimate claim upon it, the Royal Court in Durant resoundingly rejected what
it perceived to be the 'conceptual' limitations in the English tracing rules. The Royal Court
in paragraph 219 of its judgment said:
The appropriate way for the courts of this jurisdiction to address the subject is, we suggest, not by
reference to any pre-conceptions of what is or is not conceptually possible or arguably supported
by English authority, but … as a matter of evidence-at least in cases where, as here, the account
in question remains in credit throughout the relevant period, there is no question of possible
23

See Ch 6, para 6-12.

24 As is the case where property is obtained fraudulently; see Westdeutsche Landesbank Giozentrale v Islington

LBC (n 16), approved in In re Esteem Settlement (n 8). The breach of trust could be taken as being the failure of the
constructive trustee to restore to the rightful owner the assets which become subject to the trust.

insolvency and prejudice to unsecured creditors, and there is no suggestion of any intervention by
a bona fide purchaser for value. The question is, or should be, simply whether there is sufficient
evidence to establish a clear link between credits and debits to an account, irrespective (within a
reasonable time frame) of the order in which they occur or the state of the balance on the account.
It is unnecessary to posit any limitation on how, as a matter of evidence the necessary link can be
proved: it might be by means of bank documentation … or by reference to the defendant accountholders' intentions or in some other way

Therefore once a plaintiff can prove that assets in which they have a proprietary interest
have moved into a so-called 'maelstrom' of transactions, the burden of proof shifts to the
defendant trustee to show what part of the mixed fund is in fact his. The Court of Appeal in
Durant endorsed this approach noting that in appropriate cases, the necessary links can be
inferred from the circumstances, even in the absence of direct evidence.29

13-12

E. Tracing into Jersey Land
An interesting issue of principle (although perhaps of more limited practical import)30 that
is peculiar to Jersey and which is yet to be satisfactorily determined is whether it is possible
for a beneficiary to trace a proprietary interest into Jersey land. An express trust of Jersey
immovable property is prohibited by statute.31 There is no binding decision of the Royal
Court as to whether or not there can be a constructive trust (in a proprietary sense).32 In
Flynn v Reid, it was said:
69. The matter was touched upon in the matter of the Esteem Settlement 2002 JLR 53 where at
paragraph 92, Birt, DB said this:'We appreciate that the recognition of constructive trusts in such circumstances may raise questions concerning Art. 10(2)(a)(iii) of the 1984 Law [now Art 11(2)(a)(iii)], which provides that a
trust shall be invalid to the extent that "it purports to apply directly to immovable property situated
in Jersey". That would be for a decision on another occasion but, as at present advised, we think it is
strongly arguable that that provision does not apply to constructive trusts. Articles 29 and 50 [now
Arts 33 and 54 respectively] and refer to "property" which is defined by Art. 1(1) to mean "property
of any description wherever situated". It is hard to envisage that Jersey law would accept that, if a
trustee, in breach of trust, uses trust monies to purchase immovable property for his own benefit,
he should be permitted to hold that immovable property free from any trust for the beneficiaries.
In any event, any concerns about Jersey immovable property are not sufficient in our judgment, to
negate the general principle which we have described.'
[…]
71. The analysis of the Royal Court in the extract cited above comes in that part of the judgment
which considers whether the victim of fraud has an equitable proprietary interest in the proceeds

29

Durant Intl Corp v Federal Republic of Brazil (n 13) at 63-69.
Practically, owing to the highly regulated nature of the island's real property market, the circumstances in
which a professional Jersey trustee would invest the traceable proceeds of a breach of trust in land are likely be
infrequent. It remains a possibility that a constructive trustee or wrongdoing third party may apply money imbued
with a trust to purchase or improve land in Jersey.

Proprietary Remedies

of the fraud. At paragraph 88 of the Court's judgment, Birt, DB held that a beneficiary under a
constructive trust does have an equitable proprietary interest in the assets which are the subject of
that trust and then applied himself to the question as to whether Jersey law should hold that a constructive trust existed in circumstances such as those in that case. The Court concluded that when
property is obtained by fraud, equity did impose a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient
so that the victim had a proprietary interest in that property. That is the background to paragraph
92 where the Court expressed a provisional view that what is now Article 11(2)(a)(iii) of the Trust
Law did not apply in the case of constructive trusts, where the proceeds of fraud had been invested
by the trustee in Jersey real estate for his own benefit.
72. This is not a case of trustee fraud, and therefore we do not have to decide whether there is some
special category of constructive trust which could apply to Jersey real estate in the context of trustee
fraud and the issue is left over should such a case ever arise. Nonetheless we do comment that the
issue is not necessarily straightforward. Of course at one end of that spectrum, one could be faced
with a trustee who has fraudulently deprived the beneficiaries of the trust estate, and purchased
with the proceeds some real property in Jersey. There, equity may indeed demand that the beneficiaries should have recompense. More difficult is where there are competing equities, even in such
circumstances. The fraudulent trustee may have other creditors and where there has been an insufficiency of assets, it would then be an issue as to whether, in effect, the beneficiaries who have been
fraudulently deprived of the trust estate should be preferred to other creditors, who might also be
the victims of fraud, albeit not as beneficiaries.
73. Like Birt, DB in Re Esteem, we do not have to decide this issue today because the factual circumstances are quite different. We are considering today only whether a constructive trust in relation to
Jersey real estate can arise in the circumstances of this case.

13-14

If it is impossible to trace into Jersey immovables that clearly risks creating something of
a safe harbour for wrongdoers and for that reason, it seems likely that if the matter ever
required a decision, the Royal Court would fashion some remedy to vindicate the beneficiary's rights although the precise means by which this would be achieved would have to
be shaped around the existing parameters of Jersey's law of immovable property as well
as dealing satisfactorily with the protection of the rights of third party creditors of the
fiduciary. Where the land is subject to security against which the trust money has been
applied, principles of subordination might provide a means around the general prohibition
on separate equitable interest subsisting in land separate to the legal interest. It would also
seem to be possible for a beneficiary to seek vindication of their interest by pursuing the
constructive trustee for unjust enrichment33 to the extent of their contribution and then
seek to enforce that judgment by way of hypothèque judiciaire. This is a somewhat unwieldy
mechanism and does not provide the beneficiary with any priority against charge holders
who have priority to the beneficiary's own hypothèque,34 nor does it provide any security for
the beneficiary if the trustee becomes insolvent prior to judgment.

F. Bank Accounts
13-15

Trust money, provided it remains identifiable as cash, may conceptually be traced through
any number of bank accounts, the only limitation being an evidential one such as where a

Remedies against a Trustee

number of bank accounts are involved, some of which may be outside Jersey and banking
records showing the order of credits and debits are incomplete or not available.35 In such
cases the Court may be prepared to draw the inference that a payment into one account is
attributable to a previous payment out of another account and therefore traceable where
the two payments are of a similar though not identical amount and the time gap between
them is not unreasonably long.36

IV. Remedies against a Trustee
A proprietary remedy may be brought against an original trustee who appropriates a trust
asset in breach of trust, if the asset still remains in the hands of the trustee. If not, a proprietary remedy can be sought against an asset that represents that asset which is traced in a
clean or mixed substitution. In general terms the beneficiary is entitled to assert either one
of two things: (1) a continuing beneficial interest in the original trust assets (if they survive)
or in the assets or a share in the assets representing them, or (2) a claim (frequently referred
to as an equitable lien in English law, although there are no reported decisions in Jersey that
use the term lien in this context) over the original trust assets or asset which represent them,
whether through clean or mixed substitution, as security for the trustee's personal liability
to pay compensation for breach of trust. In Re PKT Consultants (Jersey) Ltd,37 later affirmed
by the seminal decision of Re Esteem Settlement,38 the Court was clear that it had adequate
powers to declare an equitable charge on a mixed fund in order to assist a beneficiary in
the vindication of their proprietary rights or to effect to assist a tracing claim. Although the
term 'lien' is not the label used in Jersey to describe this claim, it is used below to refer to it.

13-16

A. Proprietary Claims against an Original Trust Asset
Where the trustee appropriates a trust asset to himself in breach of trust, no question of
tracing arises because the asset is never deemed to have left the trust.39 The remedy available is so obvious that it hardly needs stating. The beneficiary may at his election either
assert a proprietary interest in the asset or claim a lien over the asset to secure the personal
liability of the trustee to make good his breach of trust in appropriating the asset. The
choice between a lien or an equitable proprietary interest will turn on whether the asset
has increased or decreased in value since it was misappropriated. This is exactly the same
remedy where there has been a clean substitution, as to which see below.

Proprietary Remedies

B. Tracing into a Clean Substitution
13-18

The simplest type of tracing case is where a clean substitution has taken place; where the
inherent value in a newly acquired asset is wholly attributable to the value inherent in the
old one. Stated by Lord Millett in Foskett v McKeown:40
The simplest case is where the trustee wrongfully misappropriates trust property and uses it exclusively to acquire other property for his own benefit. In such a case the beneficiary is entitled at his
option either to assert his beneficial ownership of the proceeds or to bring a personal claim against
the trustee for breach of trust and enforce an equitable lien or charge on the proceeds to secure
restoration of the trust fund.

C. Tracing into a Mixed Substitution
13-19

In cases of mixed substitution; where the whole of the inherent value in the substituted
asset is not wholly attributable to the inherent value in the original asset, but is comprised
in part from another source or sources, the beneficiary is entitled to a charge on the whole
substituted asset to the extent of the amount of the trust money laid out in its purchase.41
The charge operates on a basis similar to that in the case of a clean substitution, save that
the charge, or lien as it is termed in English law, extends to the asset as a whole rather than
some part of it attributable to the trust's contribution to its acquisition. The House of Lords
in Foskett v McKeown42 stated that the general rule for mixed substitutions is that the beneficiary can opt to take a proportionate share in assets bought through a mixed substitution.
The rule as stated by Lord Millett is as follows:
Where a trustee wrongfully uses trust money to provide part of the cost of acquiring an asset, the
beneficiary is entitled at his option either to claim a proportionate share of the asset or to enforce
a lien upon it to secure his personal claim against the trustee for the amount of the misapplied
money. It does not matter whether the trustee mixed the trust money with his own in a single fund
before using it to acquire the asset, or made separate payments (whether simultaneously or sequentially) out of the differently owned funds to acquire a single asset.

13-20

It should be noted that this is a rule about the remedy available to the beneficiary and not a
rule about the process of tracing. Below we consider how the beneficiary's share in an asset
bought using money in a mixed bank account is quantified under Jersey's tracing rules.43
The beneficiary is entitled either to assert a claim to trust property applied in breach of
trust, and the property representing it in a clean or mixed substitution, in vindication of his
equitable proprietary rights44 or to take a charge or lien for the amount due in compensation to the trust. The two remedies work in different ways and have different rationales.
The lien provides the beneficiary with security for the obligation of the trustee to restore the
value of the misappropriated asset to the trust fund. The lien may be enforced and to the

extent that the surviving trust property is insufficient to cover the loss, a personal remedy
for compensation may be pursued against the trustee.45 When the trustee has made good
the breach of trust by restoring the trust fund, then the beneficiary will cease to have any
proprietary interest in the property on which the lien is secured. Often the lien is claimed
in cases where the trustee has become insolvent and the surviving fund is insufficient to
make full restoration. In such cases there may be little or no practical difference whether
the surviving fund is taken in satisfaction of the lien or by way of assertion of a proprietary
interest.46 Where the election is a meaningful one it should usually be exercised at the time
of judgment or, if issues of tracing trust assets are dealt with by an inquiry or account subsequent to judgment, then at the time of judgment in the inquiry or the account.47

D. Subordination of Trustee's Interest in a Mixed Substitution
Where there has been a mixed substitution the lien which the beneficiary is entitled to claim
secures priority for the beneficiary over the trustee (and all those claiming through the trustee) over all the property comprised in the mixed substitution, not merely a proportionate
share in it. So where misappropriated trust money is used to purchase assets from a mixed
substitution, the beneficiary can trace the trust money or property into any number of
those assets and enforce his lien over all or any of them.48 Consequently the beneficiary can
identify his contribution in any part of the mixed substitution and subordinate any claim
the trustee may have in any share in it until the beneficiary's own claim has been satisfied.49
The equities are described to be unequal as between the beneficiary and the trustee and
in favour of the beneficiary.50 The principle of subordination allows the beneficiary to (1)
claim the credit balance surviving in a mixed bank account, to the extent that it falls within
the amount secured by the lien, when the trustee has made withdrawals from the account
and dissipated them; and (2) conversely, to exercise his lien over surviving traceable assets
or their proceeds of sale bought by the trustee with money withdrawn from the account
when the trustee has dissipated the balance in the account; and (3) to combine both (1) and
(2) by exercising his lien over assets which have been bought with withdrawals from the
account and the credit balance which remains in the account.51

Proprietary Remedies

E. Income and Interest Derived from a Traceable Asset
13-22

A beneficiary's proprietary claim to the whole or a share of assets misapplied in breach of
trust or assets representing those assets, will extend to, or to a share in, any income or interest derived from those assets.52 Where the beneficiary claims a lien in respect of trust money
or assets applied in breach of trust, the personal claim against the trustee for breach of trust
which the lien secures will normally carry interest which can include compound interest.53
Because Jersey's case law on the nature of the beneficiary's lien has rarely been properly
articulated, it is unclear whether the interest element in personal claim against the trustee is
to be added to the security so that the sum secured by the lien increases over time as interest
is added to it, without reference to any income actually earned by the property representing
the trust assets which have been misapplied. In the English cases involving disentanglement
of bank accounts, interest has not been added to the security in this way54 and it is questionable whether in other cases interest should be added to the security without reference to any
income actually earned.55

F. Locus standi to Trace
13-23

The same principles that apply in bringing a breach of trust claim also apply in bringing
a claim for a proprietary remedy.56 The beneficiaries of the trust that has been depleted
owing to the misapplication of trust money, a new replacement trustee or co-trustee will
have locus.57

G. Forms of Relief
13-24

The forms of relief that may be granted so as to give effect to a proprietary remedy in favour
of a beneficiary will vary according to the circumstances of a case. If a pure money fund is
involved, the Court will usually declare what part of it belongs to the trust and order payment to the fund. If assets other than money are involved, and it is established that those
assets belong wholly to the trust, or that the amount of a lien that is claimed plainly exceeds
the value of the assets, the Court will direct a transfer of the assets in specie to be vested in
the trustee. In cases where the beneficiaries have a proportionate share in assets, or a lien
over the assets the amount of which is less than or does not clearly exceed the value of the
assets, the Court may order a sale or other appropriate mode of realisation of the assets

before ordering a division of the proceeds. While a proprietary remedy is not discretionary58 the particular form of relief may involve an exercise of discretion by the Court. Particularly where a trustee is guilty of misappropriation, the Court can be expected to exercise
its discretion in a way which facilitates a prompt payment to the beneficiaries,59 although
if the Court is satisfied that a premature realisation would be contrary to the interest of the
beneficiaries as a whole, an order for realisation may be postponed.

H. Reinstatement of Misappropriated Funds by the Trustee
Where a trustee restores the trust by repaying the money taken from the trust and mixed in
a bank account, the remaining money in the account will be released from any proprietary
claim.60 It follows that the beneficiary has no claim on assets that are subsequently purchased with money remaining in the account following restoration.61 However, where the
trustee purchases assets for his own benefit wholly or partly from trust money, and those
assets then appreciate in value, the trustee cannot free the assets from a proprietary claim
in them by restoring the trust money wrongly applied in their purchase after the purchase
has been made and the assets have increased in value.62 A penitent trustee who wishes to
reinstate a trust fund which has become mixed up with his own assets should apply to the
Court for directions so that the Court may direct him whether to implement his proposal
to reinstate and if not, what he should do, making full and frank disclosure to the Court and
consulting with adult beneficiaries as appropriate.63

V. Proprietary Remedy against Purchasers with
Notice and Volunteers
In relation to a proprietary remedy by a beneficiary to recover misapplied trust assets, there
is a distinction between three categories of recipients of trust assets: first, purchasers or
volunteer recipients who have actual notice that the property which they have received is
transferred to them in breach of trust; secondly, innocent persons to whom trust money
or property is distributed in breach of trust in the mistaken belief that they are beneficiaries entitled under the trusts (whom in English law are referred to as 'Diplock recipients'64
although that term is not used in Jersey); and, thirdly, innocent donees from a trustee of

Proprietary Remedies

money or assets being or representing trust money or assets misappropriated by the trustee.
In English law, a proprietary remedy is available against all three categories of recipient but
the remedy is not necessarily of the same character as that available against the trustee who
commits the breach of trust in the first place.65
A purchaser or volunteer with actual notice of the breach of trust is treated in the same way
as the trustee and is subject to the same remedies of a claim to a proprietary interest or a
lien on the asset securing the beneficiary's personal remedy against the trustee for breach of
trust. A purchaser or volunteer with actual notice will, like a trustee, have their interests in
the proceeds of the trust property subordinated to the interests of the plaintiff beneficiary's
interest.66 If the recipient can be made personally liable as a knowing recipient, we consider
the beneficiary's lien would secure the knowing recipient's personal liability to 'account as
if a constructive trustee' against the recipient to make good the breach of trust.
A Diplock67 recipient is an innocent recipient of assets misapplied in breach of trust that
are subject to a proprietary remedy in favour of the true beneficiaries but who are treated
as sharing the assets proportionately with the beneficiaries on the basis that the equities
between them and the true beneficiaries are equal. The interest of a Diplock recipient in
such assets is therefore not subject to the principle of subordination.68 The true beneficiary's remedy against a Diplock recipient is a right for the beneficiary to assert a proportionate share in assets acquired through a mixed substitution.
The proprietary remedy available against innocent recipients of misappropriated trust
assets was not fully considered until Foskett v McKeown. The recipients, though themselves
innocent were treated as being in a position analogous to a wrongdoing trustee from whom
they had gratuitously derived title to the assets and, the innocent donee's, interests were
subordinated to the interests of the claimant beneficiaries.69 Thus it appears that an innocent donee and a Diplock recipient are different categories of innocent recipient, the latter
sharing with the plaintiff in a proprietary claim in proportion to their contribution with the
former's interest in a mixed substitution being subordinated.

can either seek to trace into the loan and recover the amount of the loan from the borrower, or if the borrower is not a purchaser without notice, trace through the loan into any

property acquired by the borrower with the money lent. Where the loan to a company
(which is wholly owned by the donee) is interest free, it has been held that the company
does not provide 'value' for its borrowing and so a plaintiff beneficiary is entitled to trace
through the loan into profitable assets acquired by the company and assert a proprietary
claim to them.70 This decision was later considered in Re The Esteem Settlement where the
plaintiff, having established that it could trace into the assets acquired by the company with
the loan, then sought to trace into the loan itself. It was held that the plaintiff was not entitled to trace into the loan itself.71 This decision was justified on both a narrow and a broad
ground. The narrow ground was that the plaintiff, having elected to trace through the loan
into assets acquired by the company on the basis that no value was provided for the loan,
could not at the same time seek to trace into the loan itself: the plaintiff had to elect whether
to trace into the loan or trace through the loan into the assets acquired with the loan but
he could not do both.72 The broad ground was that the economic reality of the relationship
between the donee and the donee's wholly owned company was that the loan was not really
a separate asset into which a plaintiff could trace and as a consequence the tracing exercise
must be continued into what the company does with the money.73 The result in Esteem
(certainly as far as the narrow ground) seems to turn on the outcome in the English proceedings. In a case where the plaintiff beneficiary has never sought to trace through the loan
into the assets acquired with the loan but merely seeks to trace into the loan itself there is no
inconsistency of position and, the narrow ground clearly will not apply to defeat the beneficiary's proprietary claim. It would not be acceptable for a trustee who misappropriates
trust money and lends it to his own company which remains good for the money if sued,
to compel the beneficiary to trace through the loan into the assets acquired by the company
with the loan if the plaintiff only wishes to trace into the loan. By the same logic, a donee of
a misappropriated trust asset should be in no better position than the wrongdoing trustee.

VI. Proprietary Remedy between Innocent Contributors to a
Mixed Substitution
Innocent contributors to a mixed substitution rank equally in terms of priority among
themselves.74 The innocent contributors can choose the remedy that is overall most
advantageous to them. The options in include applying the rules in Re Hallett75 and in
Re Oatway.76 The rule in Re Hallett prevents the trustee from saying that the innocent

Proprietary Remedies

party's money was lost in a bad investment; the trustee is presumed, subject to evidence
to the contrary, to have act honestly and in accordance with his duties as a fiduciary and
therefore is presumed to spend his own money in a mixed substitution first. The rule in Re
Oatway prevents the defaulting trustee from claiming that he has used his own money to
buy an asset which has increased in value in circumstances where the beneficiaries' money
in a mixed substitution would then be treated as having been dissipated (and therefore
untraceable).
The combination of these rules and the ability of the beneficiaries to elect between them
has introduced the possibility of cherry-picking.77 One of the criticisms of cherry-picking
is that it can operate arbitrarily where the outcome depends upon the choices made by the
beneficiaries after the event, which does not fit comfortably with the idea of tracing as being
an evidential exercise, concerned with the identification of existing proprietary rights, especially so where those choices could seriously prejudice the position of the trustee's personal
creditors. Durant does not say anything about the position of innocent contributors to a
mixed fund as between themselves. The apparent priority given in Durant to questions of
intention and causation could be taken as an open invitation to plaintiffs to seek to argue
around the presumptions in Re Hallett and Re Oatway to the effect that their trust money
alone was spent from a mixed fund to acquire an asset. Such an approach would put Jersey
at odds with the House of Lords in Foskett v McKeown in allowing one of multiple innocent
contributors to a mixed fund to assert only a beneficial ownership share in the fund or its
traceable process and not permitting the plaintiff to assert a lien for repayment of his or
her contribution.78
In the absence of Jersey authority on the point, we consider the House of Lords authority
to be a guide to the position, by which innocent contributors to a mixed fund share rateably in the fund concerned, in proportion to their contribution and none has a lien which
subordinates the interest of any one of them to the interest of any other.79 Such a situation
will arise if a wrongdoer takes money from different trusts to which he is a trustee and pools
them before purchasing a new asset. If the trustee has also contributed to the mixed substitution, the principle of subordination will be applied against the trustee so as to eliminate
the trustee's interest if the fund is deficient upon enforcement, with the fund then being
divided proportionately between the innocent contributors.80

Innocent Contributors & Mixed Substitutions

507

original trust property through a clean or mixed substitution, with a view to vindicating
his proprietary rights. The proprietary remedy available to beneficiaries has been much
influenced by the principle that a trustee or fiduciary must not profit from their trust,81
ensuring that a beneficiary is entitled to assert and vindicate his proprietary interest in a
profitable asset acquired with trust money through a mixed (as well as a clean) substitution
and is not restricted to a claim to the amount original misappropriated, in effect allowing
the trustee to keep the profit subject to the satisfaction of the beneficiary's personal claim.82
It is first to necessary to identify the secret profit/property which has become subject to
a constructive trust and only then does tracing become relevant. The constructive trust
imposed under the no-profit rule is not confined to cases where the 'fruit' of the original
property can be identified as representing the original property, but is imposed whenever
the trustee makes a profit by reason of his use of the trust property or position of trustee,
for instance when he takes a bribe or secret commission from a third party.83 A proprietary
remedy is concerned with the attribution of the inherent value in one asset to the inherent
value in another.84 The no-profit rule is concerned with the causal connection between the
use of trust property or a trustee's position and the making of a profit. It is possible that
the inherent value in an asset might be attributed, in part, to trust money contributed to its
acquisition, and the inherent value in that asset in turn attributed to another asset which
in the event is a much more valuable one, though the use of the trust money may not
have caused the profit to be made. On the other hand, use of trust money or the trustee's
position as such may cause the trustee to make a profitable acquisition which becomes
subject to a constructive trust even though under the proprietary remedy the interest of the
beneficiary would be much less. That would be so, for example, if an opportunity to make
an acquisition which proved to be profitable arose because an offer had been made to the
trustee in his capacity as such and the trustee in breach of trust funded part of the purchase
price from the trust money. Under the proprietary remedy the beneficiaries are confined to
seeking recovery of a proportionate share or a lien for the amount of trust money wrongly
applied in the acquisition. Under the no-profit rule the beneficiaries are entitled to claim
the entire beneficial interest in the asset subject only to a lien in favour of the trustee in
respect of his own money contributed to the purchase. There may be cases too where the
proprietary remedy is not available because no substitution has taken place, and the trust
property has been lost, yet because trust property or the position of trustee has been used
and enabled the trustee to make a profit, a constructive trust can still be imposed. The rigour of the profit rule is in some cases ameliorated by an allowance to the trustee for his skill
and labour in making the profit. It is not clear whether a similar allowance is available in
connection with the proprietary remedy.

Proprietary Remedies

VII. Mixed Substitutions in a Bank Account
13-35

This section is concerned with proprietary claims against the holder of a bank account in
respect of the beneficial title to the account holders' chose in action against the bank. Lord
Millett in Foskett v McKeown explained the nature of a mixed substitution in a bank account
as follows:85
We speak of money at the bank, and of money passing into and out of a bank account. But of
course the account holder has no money at the bank. Money paid into a bank account belongs
legally and beneficially to the bank and not to the account holder. The bank gives value for it, and it
is accordingly not usually possible to make the money itself the subject of an adverse claim. Instead
a claimant normally sues the account holder rather than the bank and lays claim to the proceeds
of the money in his hands. These consist of the debt or part of the debt due to him from the bank.
We speak of tracing money into and out of the account, but there is no money in the account.
There is merely a single debt of an amount equal to the final balance standing to the credit of the
account holder. No money passes from paying bank to receiving bank or through the clearing system (where the money flows may be in the opposite direction). There is simply a series of debits
and credits which are causally and transactionally linked.

13-36

The inherent value of cash paid into a bank account becomes represented in the chose in
action or debt claim the account holder has against the bank; the chose in action is the substitute of the cash deposited with the bank. When a credit balance is transferred from one
bank account to another, the inherent value in that credit becomes represented in the chose
in action against the transferee bank.

A. Mixed Substitutions in a Bank Account
13-37

13-38

There is a mixed substitution in a bank account when the sum standing to the credit of
the account is not wholly attributable to payments into it from a single source. In a trust
context, there will commonly be a mixed substitution in a bank account where the sum
standing in credit is in part attributable to payments into the account of money belonging beneficially to the trustee and in part attributable to other money held by him in trust,
or where that sum is attributable to payments into the account from multiple different
sources, none of which belong beneficially to the trustee.
If the payments into the account have been derived exclusively from one source, say a trust,
there is a clean substitution. A clean substitution will become a mixed substitution if later
payments into the account are made from any source other than the same trust. If the same
trust is and remains the sole source of payments into a bank account (and the account
remains in credit), generally no evidential difficulty arises when it comes to tracing and
no legal difficulty arises when it comes to enforcing a proprietary interest: the chose in
action will entirely beneficially to the trust. Greater difficulty arises in a mixed substitution
because it becomes necessary to determine the extent of the trust's (or other contributors') proprietary interest in the chose in action. A mixed substitution does not necessarily
85

ibid, at 127-128.

Mixed Substitutions in a Bank Account

509

involve the acquisition of a new asset. It will suffice if the inherent value in one asset passes
into another asset that is already held beneficially by another.86

B. Simple Case: A Mixed Substitution in a Bank Account
Where there is a mixed substitution, the credit balance in the bank account belongs to the
trust and any other contributor to the account proportionately according to their respective contributions into it.87 If the trustee transfers £1,000 of trust money into his own bank
account which is £9,000 in credit, the trustee will, following the payment in of trust money,
own 90 per cent of a chose in action worth £10,000. Assuming the plaintiff brings his proprietary claim before there have been any further movements in the account, he will have
a proprietary claim for £1,000. In a simple case a similar approach will apply as between
innocent contributors to the account, as where the trustee mixes trust money from different
trusts in the same account as his own, or against a Diplock recipient who pays trust money
into his own account which is in credit.

13-39

C. Running Account
Very few cases are as simple as that outlined above. Most involve an examination of a running account of deposits and withdrawals from the account, after the first payment of trust
money into the account. It then becomes necessary to determine to what extent the credit
balance surviving in the account and the sums withdrawn to purchase traceable assets is
attributed to the trust money paid in, both for the purpose of claiming a lien against a
trustee or other wrongdoer and for the purpose of determining the beneficiary's proprietary share of the chose in action. In a case where the claim is against the trustee or other
wrongdoer the straightforward approach is that the beneficiary can, in view of the principle of subordination, locate the value of the trust money in any part of the bank account
to the extent that that is possible and assert a lien accordingly.88 In a case where the claim
is not against the trustee or other wrongdoer it is not possible to apply the concept of
subordination and the proportionate share can be determined by working out new proportionate shares every time there is a withdrawal from or deposit into the account. That
approach, has found favour in Jersey and is sometimes called 'the North American model'.89
The North American model has been rejected in England on the ground of its complexity
and perceived impracticability.90 In England, the starting point is Clayton's Case,91 which
is not itself a tracing case,92 but which nonetheless provides a mechanism for attributing
withdrawals out of a running bank account to payments into it.

D. The Rule in Clayton's Case
13-41

13-42

Under the rule in Clayton's Case, also known as the 'first-in, first-out' rule, payments out
of a bank account are matched or attributed to payments into the account in the order in
which payments were paid in. The first payment out is attributed to the first payment in,
and so on. The effect of the rule, where withdrawals have been made and dissipated, is to
establish a reverse order of priority; the later the payment into the account the greater the
likelihood of that payment not being attributed to a payment out and hence of still being
represented as a portion of the credit balance remaining in the account when the account
falls to be disentangled. Jersey has rejected the rule in Clayton's Case in favour of the North
American, apportionment method whereby there is a rateable apportionment on the basis
of the contributions.93
The first-in, first-out rule, when applied to a claim against a trustee or other wrongdoer,
contrary to the principle that underpins subordination, can in fact operate to the advantage
of the trustee or wrongdoer where the trustee or wrongdoer makes payments of his own
money into the account after the payment in of trust money and then makes withdrawals.
As between innocent contributors, where the principle of subordination does not apply,
the application of the first-in, first-out rule means that payments in by late contributors are
more likely to survive in the account than payments in of earlier contributors.94 However,
whether in respect of actions against innocent co-contributors or wrongdoing trustees, the
first-in, first-out rule is not routinely applied in Jersey.

E. Running Account-Claim against Trustee or other Wrongdoer:
The Rule in Re Hallett
13-43

13-44

An strict application of the first-in, first-out rule as against a trustee may result in the attribution of the trust money paid into the account to withdrawals by the trustee which are
then dissipated (becoming untraceable) and the attribution of the remaining credit balance
in the account to the trustee's own payments into the account, thereby conferring a benefit
on the trustee.95
The unfairness of this result has been modified, so far as the claim is only between the beneficiaries and the trustee (or other wrongdoer). So long as withdrawals made by the trustee
can be attributed to money paid by him into the account, those withdrawals, if spent by
him, may be attributed to the trustee's own money, leaving the trust money intact, ie the
trustee is presumed not to spend the trust money if it can be attributed to his own money.96
This is the Re Hallett rule and arises from the general proposition that where a person does

Mixed Substitutions in a Bank Account

an act which may be rightfully performed, he cannot say that the act was intentionally,
and in fact, done wrongly; so far as possible the honest intention of drawing out his own
money must be attributed to the trustee. That is to say that notwithstanding the breach of
trust in misapplying the money, the rule presumes the trustee remains honest. The Hallett
rule is the way the principle of subordination is applied to mixed bank accounts. Thus the
beneficiary is able to locate the value represented by the trust money paid into the account
in the credit balance remaining in the account. The Hallett rule does not preclude a beneficiary from tracing the value represented by the trust money in withdrawals made by the
trustee which survive in a traceable form. There are no Jersey cases in which the Re Hallett
rule, as expressed above, has been applied although the Royal Court in PKT Consultants
Jersey97 did (albeit without the benefit of detailed argument) adopt Hallett98 and that was
not departed from by the Royal Court in Esteem. In Esteem the Royal Court decided that
Jersey would not follow Clayton's Case but made no comments as regards the applicability
of the Hallett rule because Esteem concerned claims between competing innocent contributors to a mixed account. It would appear that notwithstanding that the first-in, first-out
rule does not apply to Jersey and therefore part of the rationale for having the Hallett rule is
undermined, in the absence of any express disavowal of it the rule that a trustee is presumed
to spend his own money from a mixed fund first can, still be presumed to have survived as
a free-standing principle of Jersey law.

F. The Lowest Intermediate Balance
The Hallett rule does not have the effect of preserving the value representing the trust
money paid into the account greater than the balance in the account when withdrawals are
made by the trustee after the payment in of the trust money. So if the trustee makes further
withdrawals from the bank account so as to further reduce the credit balance down to near
zero that will prima facie99 be the limit of the amount which the beneficiary can claim. The
trustee may subsequently pay in further money of his own, but that cannot be attributed to
the trust money paid into the account because prima facie that does not have its source in
trust monies and does not represent the trust money.100

13-45

In English law, the beneficiary's claim is limited to such an amount as does not exceed the
lowest intermediate balance in the account during the intervening period between the payment in of the trust money and the time when the disentanglement of the account falls to
be made. Jersey does not recognise the 'lowest intermediate balance rule' as having the status of a rule101 on the ground that it afforded a fraudster a means to defeat a tracing claim
by manipulating the sequence of credits and debits in a bank account. The Jersey Court of

Appeal has considered the 'lowest intermediate balance rule' to be102 simply another aspect
of requiring a beneficiary to establish a sufficiently clear link between the original property
and its traceable proceeds and if that is possible the lowest intermediate balance rule will
yield to it.
Even as a matter of English law, the lowest intermediate balance rule will not be applied if it
can clearly be shown that the trustee, by making the subsequent payment into the account
intended to reinstate the trust money previously taken out, but the trustee will not be taken
as having made the subsequent payment in for that purpose merely from the fact that previously trust money has been withdrawn.103 The lowest intermediate balance rule is consistent with the principle of subordination because the value representing the payment in of
trust money cannot, by reason of the later withdrawals, be attributed to anything more than
the lowest intermediate balance and the excess above the lowest intermediate balance must
necessarily be attributable to the trustee's or wrongdoer's later payments in.104

G. Claims and Priorities as between Innocent Contributors and Innocent
Donees and Innocent Recipients
13-48

The Hallett rule has no application where the equities are equal, that is to say as between
competing beneficial plaintiffs for a determination as to the beneficial ownership of the
credit balance remaining in a mixed bank account held by the trustee. The first-in, firstout rule will prima facie not be applied, and the sums withdrawn will, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, be apportioned proportionately, ie as the different contributions
in the account bear to one another at the moment before each withdrawal is made.105 It is
to be noted that the apportionment method may result in some contributors, particularly
earlier contributors, receiving an amount greater than would be available to them under
the lowest intermediate balance rule, a point which, though not considered expressly by the
Jersey courts, has been considered in Canada where the conclusion has been reached that
the lowest intermediate balance rule is irrelevant in the present context.106 Where there are
full computerised banking records available, the application of the apportionment method
referred to above, may be straightforward, although not necessarily inexpensive to carry
out.107

Assets Acquired with Trust Monies

513

VIII. Mixed Substitutions-Tracing into Assets Acquired
with Trust Monies
This section considers two scenarios where questions arise as to how the tracing rules apply
for the purpose of identifying assets against which either a lien or proprietary claim to a
proportionate share may be asserted against a trustee or other wrongdoer:
1.
2.

13-49

assets acquired with the aid of a borrowing secured on the asset; and
assets acquired out of a previously mixed bank account

As a general rule, where an asset is acquired through a mixed substitution, a beneficiary can
assert a proportionate share in the asset. Where the asset is acquired by the trustee or other
wrongdoer the beneficiary may in the alternative claim a lien or charge over the asset to
secure his personal claim against the trustee for breach of trust.

13-50

A. Asset Purchase with Credit Secured on the Asset
If a trustee, in breach of trust applies trust money to at least some of the deposit or part of
the purchase money on an asset, with the balance of the purchase money being raised by the
trustee or other wrongdoer by way of credit secured on the asset, the money raised by the
trustee virtue of the security does not count as a contribution by him to the purchase, since
his ability to obtain the loan was dependent on the unauthorised acquisition with trust
money of the asset which formed the security.108 If the trustee contributes nothing to the
deposit or the purchase price beyond raising money on the security of the asset, the beneficiary will take the whole beneficial interest in the asset subject to the security interest if the
security holder is a bona fides security holder without actual notice of the trustee's breach
of trust.109 If the trustee pays off the principal sum that is the subject of the security with
his own money, the trustee is entitled to credit as against the plaintiff beneficiary against
the proceeds of sale of the asset of an amount equal to the principal repaid or advanced, but
not to any sums incurred in respect of interest, costs or charges on the mortgage. Thus, the
beneficiary takes the benefit of all the increase in value of the asset.110

of the proceeds of sale of land bought by the trustee with trust money and money raised on the equitable mortgage the principal advanced, but not the full sum due under the mortgage. An equitable mortgagee does not gain
priority over the beneficiary through a defence of purchase without notice. Even where the mortgage is in favour
of a legal mortgagee the trustee may be unable to circumvent or mitigate the result stated in the text by taking an
assignment from the mortgagee.

Proprietary Remedies

B. Trust Money Used to Discharge Credit Secured on the Asset
13-52

13-53

Where the trustee or other recipient of trust money uses it to pay off the principal on a
loan which is secured on the asset, either in whole or in part, the beneficiary will acquire an
interest in the asset in the proportion that the trust's 'contribution' to the security bears to
the purchase price.111
It seems at least arguable that where trust money is used to discharge a debt incurred by
the trustee for the purpose of acquiring a specific asset, and the debt or the loan is repaid
out of trust money, a beneficiary can trace into the repayment of a debt or loan so as to
give him a remedy of a proprietary character by way of subrogation to the lender's right of
security.112 Whether it is possible for a plaintiff beneficiary to be subrogated to the rights of
a mortgagee of Jersey land in this fashion is unclear-English law principles do not readily
apply to a system of real property that is unique to the island. In Durant, it was suggested
that, proving the implied intention of the defendant to reimburse the depleted trust fund
or acquire an asset in the expectation of receiving money imbued with a trust would be a
sufficient, but not necessary way of establishing a sufficient link between the original assets
and their traceable proceeds.113

C. Assets Purchased with Money Withdrawn by Trustee or other
Wrongdoer from a Mixed Bank Account-the Re Oatway Rule
13-54

In a case where withdrawals have been made from a mixed account and spent by the trustee
the Hallett rule permits the beneficiary to locate the value represented by the trust money
paid into a mixed bank account in the credit balance remaining in the account. Where withdrawals have been made by the trustee from a mixed bank account and applied to buy traceable assets or their proceeds of sale, but the credit balance remaining in the account is then
dissipated by the trustee, the trustee is not permitted to maintain that the assets bought by
him with money withdrawn from the account, or their traceable proceeds of sale, represent
his money alone.114 The assets are subject to a lien in favour of the beneficiary. The rule in
Re Oatway is entirely consistent with the principle of subordination and preserves a beneficiary's ability to trace.

111 This analysis relies upon reverse or backwards tracing being possible under Jersey law. As to backwards
­tracing generally, and its place in Jersey specifically see para 13-86 below.
112 Lewin on Trusts (n 26) 41-110; Smith (n 48) 146 et seq. See Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan
(n 99) at [216G-217B], per Dillon LJ and Foskett v McKeown (n 2) at 283G-284A, per Scott V-C. In Jyske Bank
(Gibraltar) Ltd v Spjeldnaes, 23 July 1997 (unreported) at 331-34, it was held that where there is evidence from
which the Court can infer that a fraudulent trustee intended to acquire an asset with money overdrawn from a
bank account knowing that the overdraft would either be paid off or restored within its limit by money obtained
in breach of trust over which the trustee had direct or indirect control, it is appropriate in those circumstances
for the Court to impose on the asset to be acquired a constructive trust on its acquisition. It is to be noted that
the decision, although not the reasoning leading to it, turns on the existence of circumstances (including fraud on
the part of the trustee) justifying the imposition of a constructive trust rather than an application of a backwards
tracing rule.

Assets Acquired with Trust Monies

515

The lien is not limited to the amount withdrawn to purchase the assets. Any movement in
the value of the asset has no bearing on the amount of the lien, though they may affect the
amount that is actually recovered on enforcement if the value of the assets falls below the
amount secured. Where the value of the value of the asset falls within the amount secured
by the lien, the beneficiary is entitled, on enforcement, to the whole of the profit (to the
extent of the profit falling within the amount secured) deriving from an asset bought with
money withdrawn from a mixed bank account.
It makes no difference that the money that is withdrawn in order to purchase the assets
exceeds the amount of trust money paid into the account. The ability of the beneficiary
to identify the trust money paid into the account (at least in part) in the assets which have
been bought with the mixed fund supports a lien over the whole of those assets under the
general rule concerning mixed substitutions.
Because Jersey does not subscribe to the lowest intermediate balance rule, it would seem
that the amount that can be recovered through enforcement of the lien is, unlike in England,
unaffected by the lowest intermediate balance rule.115 If £3,000 of trust money is paid
into an account and following withdrawals by the trustee the balance in the account reduces
to £2,000. The trustee then applies that £2,000 together with £1,000 of his own funds later
added to the account in the purchase of an asset for £3,000 which maintains its value: does
the beneficiary have a lien for the value of £3,000 or £2,000? Applying the lowest intermediate balance rule means the claim is limited to £2,000. Under English law if the lowest intermediate balance rule were not applied to the above situation the beneficiary would obtain
a windfall of an extra £1,000 that he would not otherwise have obtained had the money
remained in the bank account. Therefore, while under English law the amount of the lien
will not be affected by movements in value of assets bought out of the mixed bank account,
it will be affected by reductions in the credit balance of the account below the amount of
trust money paid in before the purchase has taken place, that is not the case in Jersey.
The principle of subordination on which the Oatway rule is based can be used in more
complex cases than Re Oatway itself. Suppose, for example, that £3,000 of trust money is
paid into the account which is £2,000 in credit with the trustee's own money, and the trustee applies £1,000 in the purchase of assets which he then sells, the proceeds of sale being
dissipated; applies £2,000 in the purchase of assets which increase in value to £2,500 and are
retained by the trustee; and withdraws and spends £1,500 leaving a credit balance of £500
in the account. The beneficiary can identify the trust money paid into the account partly in
the retained assets and partly in the remaining credit balance and, through enforcement of
his lien, recover the original value of £3,000.

D. Claim to a Proportionate Share against Assets Bought by a Trustee with
Money Withdrawn from a Mixed Bank Account
The beneficiary's lien will be the best remedy where the assets bought with money withdrawn from a mixed bank account or their proceeds, and with any remaining balance in the
115 Inconsistent views on this point are expressed in the American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of
Restitution, Quasi-Contracts and Constructive Trusts; and Smith (n 48) 201, fn 150.

Proprietary Remedies

account, do not exceed the trust money paid into the account. Where the assets, proceeds
or money do exceed the amount of the original trust money paid into the account, the
beneficiary's lien securing the trustee's obligation to make good the breach of trust cannot
be used to recover any of the excess, subject to any interest on the sum secured by the lien.
If the beneficiary wishes to claim the excess, they must claim a beneficial interest and cannot at the same time rely on their lien. This involves tracing the value representing trust
money paid into a mixed bank account into an asset bought out of it which has proved to
be a profitable one.

E. Dissipation and Mixed Performing Assets Purchased with Mixed Funds
13-60

There is a greater degree of complexity in cases in which either the trustee makes withdrawals from a mixed account and dissipates them, or where a number of different assets are
bought with money from the mixed account, and those assets assume different values by
the time of the claim.

i. Dissipation by the Trustee
13-61

Where the trustee pays £5,000 of trust money into his own bank account which is £7,000
in credit, withdraws and dissipates £4,000, and then buys with the £8,000 remaining in the
account some asset which later increases in value. The possible solutions are as follows:
1.

The beneficiary's proportionate share in the asset bought for £8,000 is five-twelfths on
the footing that the principle of subordination is to be disregarded, ie the beneficiary
is taken as having a five-twelfths share in the whole fund, even the £4,000 withdrawn
by the trustee even though they are spent by the trustee for his own benefit ('solution
one').
The beneficiary's proportionate share in that asset is five-eighths on the footing that
the £4,000 withdrawals can be attributed wholly to the trustee in accordance with the
principle of subordination ('solution two').

2.

13-62

An English court, in accordance with the Hallett rule, would apply the principle of subordination, at least to the extent of attributing money withdrawn and dissipated before the
purchase to the trustee's own money, thereby adopting the second solution. However, under
English law, unlike in Jersey law, the beneficiary's claim to a proportionate share will be
limited by the lowest intermediate balance rule.

ii. Asset Cherry-Picking to Maximise Recovery116
13-63

The trustee pays £5,000 of trust money into his own bank account which is already £3,000
in credit. The trustee then purchases shares in Company A for £6,000, which later treble
in value, and shares in Company B for £2,000, which maintain their value. The possible

116

See comments of Rimer J in Shalson v Russo (n 76).

Assets Acquired with Trust Monies

517

solutions to the situation in which the trustee applies a mixed fund to purchase a number of
assets that by the time of the claim have widely disparate values, are as follows:
1.
2.

the beneficiary has a five-eighths share in both assets with the result that his claim is
worth £12,500 ('solution one'); or
the beneficiary is entitled under the principle of subordination to identify the £5,000
of trust money only in the purchase of the asset which trebles in value so that he has
a five-sixths share of that asset and no share in the other asset with the result that his
claim is worth £15,000 ('solution two').

The second solution is clearly of greater benefit to the beneficiary. It might be said that if
subordination applies at least to the extent that money withdrawn and dissipated by the
trustee is attributed to the trustee's own money, the principle should logically apply also so
as to allow the beneficiary to cherry-pick the most profitable investment as that to which
the trust money is to be attributed.117 The second solution is very likely to be adopted if it
can be proven that that result accorded with the trustee's or other wrongdoer's intention
to apply trust money to the maximum extent possible in the acquisition of the asset which
proved to be the most profitable.118
However, where no such intention is apparent, the authors' have reservations as to whether the
principle of subordination can be deployed so as to permit a beneficiary to cherry-pick what
turns out to be the most profitable asset. It is one thing to say that the trustee cannot claim
that money which he has withdrawn and spent for his own benefit should be attributed to the
trust money paid into the account if it can be attributed to his own money. It is quite another
to say that the beneficiary can locate the trust money in the most profitable investment to
the maximum extent possible. Subordination has no effect on either the amount which is
secured by the lien or the extent of the beneficiary's share in any assets bought from the mixed
bank account. Subordination's role is to enable the beneficiary to identify the trust money in
anything that survives from the trustee's wrongdoing by mixing trust money with his own.
Though the beneficiary can take the whole of the benefit of profits made from assets bought
out of the mixed bank account so far as they fall within the amount secured by the lien, the
beneficiary can never make a profit out of the principle of subordination if he claims a lien,
because the amount of recovery is necessarily limited to the amount secured which does not
change depending on the fluctuating value of the assets into which it is possible to trace.
Notwithstanding our reservations, Jersey's tracing rules, including those rules applicable to
the quantification of the beneficiary's proportionate share in assets bought from the mixed
account are still in the process of development and refinement. The Royal Court may yet
be persuaded to extend the principle of subordination so as to allow the beneficiary to
maximise his share in the most profitable investment at the expense of a trustee who has
misappropriated trust money for his own benefit or the benefit of another and then mixed
it with his own. There is some authority which suggests that the principle of subordination
may be extended in this way as against a trustee who misappropriates trust money.119

Proprietary Remedies

F. Assets Bought with Money Withdrawn from a Mixed Bank Account-
Claim to a Proportionate Share between Innocent Contributors or
against a Diplock Recipient
13-67

The principle of subordination has no role to play as between the innocent contributors, nor
against a Diplock recipient. The Court will adopt a pari passu or rateable approach120 that
is sometimes adopted between innocent parties in relation to money surviving in a bank
account, rather than apply the first-in, first-out rule in Clayton's Case, which, apart from not
being part of the law of Jersey, is also liable to produce highly arbitrary results.121 In a case
where a payment of trust money into an account corresponds identically or at least closely
in amount with a withdrawal from the account shortly afterwards for the purpose of buying
some asset, the withdrawal may be attributed wholly to that payment into the account.122

IX. Improvements to Traceable Assets
13-68

13-69

13-70

Hitherto we have examined the possibility of a proprietary remedy where trust money
has been applied to acquire, either by way of a clean or mixed substitution a new asset.
A different issue arises as to whether trust money spent on improvements to land (which
because of the prohibition on trusts over immovable property within the island, is confined
to improvements to property outside Jersey)123 and chattels is capable of amounting to a
mixed substitution so that a proprietary remedy is available as against the improved asset?
This issue marks one of the frontiers between proprietary remedies and the law of unjust
enrichment. The distinction is of practical importance especially where a change of position defence may be available.
Expenditure on improvement to property can take a variety of forms: the cost of services
provided by construction contractors, the cost of professional fees and disbursements, and
the cost of materials used and becoming affixed to or acceded to the existing asset. Such
expenditure merits different treatment from a mixed substitution of cash in a bank account
because it may not be reflected in the eventual value of the property that has been improved.
In some cases, say the repainting of a house in a particularly offensive colour scheme, the
value of the asset 'improved' in the eyes of the owner may in fact depreciate in value.
It has been held in Jersey that where funds are spent on improvements to property already
owned by an innocent volunteer, the plaintiff beneficiary can trace into the increased value
of the property which is attributable to those funds.124 If there has been no increase in value
v McKeown suggests that the principle of subordination allows cherry-picking in the quantification of the beneficiary's proportionate share in different assets bought from a mixed bank account. See also Shalson v Russo (n 76)
at [143]-[144].

121

Improvements to Traceable Assets

519

attributable to the traceable funds there can be no tracing at all.125 Even where there is an
increase in value, tracing may be barred where the Court considers it inequitable to allow
the plaintiff beneficiary to trace.126 This effectively means there is a change of position
defence available to an innocent volunteer who spends trust money on their own property.
In the case of expenditure on land or chattels of the trustee or wrongdoer, the beneficiary
would acquire the option of either a lien for the amount of the expenditure or a proportionate share and no change of position defence is available.
Where there has been a clean or mixed substitution in the nature of an acquisition, there
is no question of the principles of unjust enrichment and its defence of change of position having any bearing on the remedy available. In such cases the claim is to vindicate the
beneficiary's continuing beneficial rights in the property itself-the defendant has not been
enriched to any degree. A beneficiary's claim to the increase in value is based not in the
vindication of the beneficiaries' rights in the thing acquired with his money; the rationale
is to reverse the defendant's unjust enrichment by use of the plaintiff beneficiary's money.
The use of the term 'trace' in Esteem in relation to expenditure on improvements to preexisting assets is potentially misleading. While it is possible to trace into an increase in
value, that is not to say that the beneficiary's interest in tracing will inevitably lead to a
proprietary remedy. Tracing is an exercise, not a claim or remedy and can be relevant otherwise than for the purpose of asserting a proprietary remedy. The purpose of tracing in this
context is to identify whether there has been an increase in value due to the expenditure and
to identify into whose hands that increase in value resides. Even if there has been an increase
in value the beneficiary's claim may still be defeated if the Court considers it inequitable to
permit enforcement.
The position in Jersey differs from that in English law where expenditure on improvements
to land or chattels is not considered to be analogous to a mixed substitution in a bank
account for the following reason. In the case of a bank account the chose in action is a
right to sue the bank and it is easy to attribute the value inherent in the chose in action to
the money paid into the account or the premiums paid on the policy. In the case of land
or chattels the value inherent in the rights of a landowner against the world is attributable
to his acquisition of the land or chattels, not to the improvements to them. While it may
be the case that expenditure has resulted in a physical alteration to the land or chattels that
of itself cannot form the basis for a mixed substitution because the same could be said of
expenditure which reduces rather than increases the market value of the land or chattels.

A. Improvement of Trustee's or Wrongdoer's own Assets with Trust Money
A proprietary remedy, by way of a constructive trust, will arise against a trustee who makes
a profit from expenditure of trust money on improvements to or maintenance of his own
assets. Such a profit would be recoverable under the no-profit rule, which depends on the
Law Review 139 at 31. Such an innocent volunteer recipient will concurrently be liable to make restitution to a
beneficiary but only to the extent that the recipient remains unjustly enriched.

Proprietary Remedies

causal connection between the use of trust money and the making of a profit by the trustee,
not on the attribution of the value of the asset after the expenditure in part to the trust
money which has been spent as though a mixed substitution has taken place. For example,
if the trustee acquires a plot of land (outside Jersey) for £100,000 with his own money
and develops it with £500,000 of trust money so that the site becomes worth £1 million,
the developed property would, under the no-profit rule at least, be held on a constructive
trust as to five-sixths for the beneficiary. It might conceivably be argued to be held as to the
whole on a constructive trust for the beneficiary subject to a lien in favour of the trustee for
£100,000 in respect of the acquisition cost with perhaps also an allowance for the trustee's
skill and labour in making the profit. No change of position defence is available against a
trustee who spends trust money improving his own property. The basis of the beneficiaries'
claim is not unjust enrichment but an assertion of the beneficiary's continued beneficial
ownership and its proceeds.

B. Improvement to an Innocent Recipient's Land or Chattels with Trust
Money
13-75

Where trust funds are spent improving a property that is already owned by an innocent
volunteer, the plaintiff beneficiary may trace into any increased value of the property which
is attributable to those funds. If there has been no increase in value attributable to the
traceable funds there can be not tracing at all127 on the basis that the defendant is no longer
enriched. While it is possible to trace, that is not to say that the beneficiary's interest in
tracing will inevitably lead to a proprietary remedy. Tracing is an evidential exercise, not a
claim or remedy and can be relevant otherwise than for the purpose of asserting a proprietary remedy. The purpose of tracing in this context is to identify whether there has been
an increase in value due to the expenditure and to identify into whose hands that increase
in value resides. Even if there has been an increase in value the beneficiary's claim may still
be defeated if the Court considers it inequitable to permit enforcement.

C. Trustee Spending Money of one Trust on Improvements to Assets in
another Trust
13-76

Where a trustee misappropriates money from trust A (of which he is the trustee) and spends
it to improve assets comprised in trust B of which he is also trustee, without any consideration being paid by trust B then the position is the same as where the trustee spends trust
money to improve his own assets.128 Where money from one trust is mistakenly applied to
pay for improvements to assets of another trust, the case is closely analogous to the case of
expenditure by an innocent recipient of trust money on improvements to his own land or
chattels.

Re the Esteem Settlement (n 8) at [131].
But see Shalson v Russo (n 76) at [157], where Rimer J. considered that voluntary expenditure by a wrongdoing trustee on construction of a boat owned by an innocent third party would not give the beneficiary a proprietary interest in or charge over the boat, though did not exclude the possibility of a personal restitutionary claim
against the owner of the boat.

Improvements to Traceable Assets

521

There would be a defence of change of position if the expenditure by the trustee was not
authorised by the terms of the trust that owned the assets, or could not be regarded as reasonable expenditure so far as that trust was concerned, such that the trustee would have no
right of indemnity in respect of it had he spent his own money. The defence is also likely
to be available where a proprietary remedy is sought by way of subrogation; the innocent
volunteer having discharged secured debts with the trust money. There might be a defence
if the means of enforcement of the beneficiary's right to trace would work harshly against
the beneficiaries of the trust owning the land or chattels, for example if enforcement would
involve the sale of an asset that provided the livelihood of those beneficiaries.129

13-77

The innocent recipient of an asset subject to a proprietary tracing claim owes no duties in
relation to it until they have notice of the proprietary claim made to the asset. Until that
time the innocent recipient cannot be held liable for disposal of it.130 The only liability such
a person has is as a constructive bare trustee, holding and preserving the assets pending a
transfer to the true beneficial owner. The position established since Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale131 is that a change of position is a defence to a personal restitutionary claim to reverse
unjust enrichment. A tracing claim on the other hand is said to be premised on the vindication of proprietary rights and it therefore follows that a change of position defence is not
available as a defence to a tracing claim. The loosening of the link between the beneficiaries'
original entitlement to the asset and the assets subsequently liable to be subject to a proprietary claim brings into question (eg by the possibility of backwards tracing) whether there
is such a clear demarcation between cases of unjust enrichment and cases involving proprietary relief. If tracing is to become a more flexible, merits based exercise, then the intuitive
appeal of a defence of change of position by an innocent recipient whose position would be
prejudiced by reliance on the receipt of traceable funds or assets representing them may be
a siren call for the courts in future cases.132
The Court in Esteem considered what remedy it could grant to give effect to a tracing remedy were there had been trust money spent on improvements. It posited that it might be
able to impose an equitable charge but came to the view on the facts that an order for sale
would not be inequitable. Since in this situation one is concerned with a remedy founded
on unjust enrichment and not a remedy vindicating property rights, it would be permissible to take a variety of factors into account in determining whether a charge or lien should
be imposed and if so to what extent and on what terms. An alternative approach133 may be
that the beneficiaries of the trust whose money has been spent should be entitled to be subrogatedto the trustee's right of indemnity as trustee of the trust owning the assets that have
been improved to recover the money spent, provided that it was authorised expenditure or,
even if unauthorised, that it benefited the trust owning the land or chattels, and provided

that the money was spent by the trustee in his capacity as trustee of the trust owning the
land or chattels and not as settlor.134

X. Mixtures and Identification-Shares in Companies
13-80

13-81

If the trustee adds a number of shares in Company A, that are owned by the trust, to his
own holding, then the beneficiary is entitled to seek recovery of the same number of shares
back. If the trustee has disposed of part of the overall holding and the trust shares cannot be
identified by number or otherwise, the trustee will be treated as having disposed of his own
shares before the trust shares so as to allow the plaintiff to the tracing claim, if he wishes, to
claim back the trust shares out of the residue of the holding.135 If the shares are numbered
and the numbers of the shares are known, or they can be identified in some other way, there
is no mixture. In such a case the trust shares retained by the trustee can be claimed directly
from him and the others can be traced into the hands of a transferee who is not a purchaser
for value without notice.
Where two trust funds are wrongly mixed together and administered together as one fund,
the mixed fund will be divided between the two trusts in the same proportions that the
value of the two separate funds bear to each other at the date of the mixture. The Court will
not seek to trace the individual assets of the two funds into their separate product. Thus
where the funds of two charities had been intermixed and dealt with as a common fund
for the best part of two centuries, and part of the trust funds, which, however, could be
traced as having originally belonged to one of the charities, had been invested in land which
subsequently increased considerably in value, it was held that the profit must be taken to
have been made by the whole trust, and must be apportioned between the charities in the
proportions in which they were originally entitled to the common fund.136 We question,
however, whether this rule would be applied where the mixture has not subsisted for an
inordinate period of time, and sufficient records of the trusts are available to enable the
original separate assets of the two trusts to be identified or traced through into the assets
held in the mixed fund at the time of division.

XI. When Assets Become Untraceable
13-82

A tracing exercise and a proprietary remedy will fail if trust property applied in breach of
trust has passed into the hands of equity's darling; a bona fides purchaser of the legal estate
without actual notice,137 or there ceases to be any property which represents the trust property over which the remedy can be asserted.

When Assets Become Untraceable

523

A. Tracing through Overdrawn Bank Accounts
Prima facie, money cannot be traced through an overdrawn bank account.138 If the withdrawals from the account into which trust money has been paid reduce the balance to nil,
or put the account into overdraft, there is nothing which can be said to represent the trust
money paid into the account and nothing for the beneficiary to claim. It makes no difference that the trustee subsequently replenishes the account with money of his own.139 For
the same reason, if trust money is paid into an account that is already overdrawn,140 there is
nothing which can be traced since the money goes to pay off the trustee's debt to the bank
and in that way is dissipated. There is usually no prospect of being able to trace against the
bank itself which is usually a purchaser for value without notice. The same rationale applies
to the traceability of trust money that is used to satisfy a debt; the receiving creditor will
usually be a purchaser without notice, neither will there usually be anything which can be
said to represent the trust money.
Following the Court of Appeal and Privy Council decisions in Federal Republic of Brazil
v Durant141 it seems that provided a plaintiff can establish a coordinated scheme between
the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of a traceable asset such as to warrant
the Court attributing the value of the interest acquired in the asset to the misuse of the
trust fund, then it does not seem to matter if the misappropriated funds were paid into an
overdrawn bank account (and so on an orthodox analysis treated as having been dissipated
before the asset is acquired). Where there is evidence of an intention to obfuscate the tracing exercise, the Court will not be rigidly bound by the order of the transactions appearing in the running account.142 However, in Durant, the Privy Council was careful to make
clear that it did not wish to go so far as to completely abrogate the principle against tracing
through debts and overdrawn accounts and the loser approach only appears to apply where
there is evidence of a coordinated scheme. In the absence of evidence of an intention of a
coordinated scheme between the depletion of the fund and the acquisition of an asset, then
it appears that recourse should be had to the orthodox principle that no tracing is possible. It is wholly unclear how the transaction could be unravelled if the bank withdrew the
overdraft facility as soon as the trust money was credited into it. In those circumstances, it
would be difficult to avoid the orthodox position that it is not possible to trace through an
overdrawn account.

B. Assets Purchased with the Assistance of a Credit Facility
13-85

Where a trustee or other recipient of trust money purchases an asset by reason of an overdraft on an account or a credit card, into which trust money has been paid, on an orthodox
analysis the trust money cannot generally be traced into the asset that has already been
acquired with the credit facility prior to the trust funds being credited in.143 Although it
seems tolerably clear that in a case where the purchase is made by a trustee, the no-profit
rule144 will apply because the trustee has been enabled to make the acquisition by his use of
trust money ('use' in this sense being to reduce his own debt rather in its direct application
to acquire an asset), thereby allowing the beneficiaries to claim that the asset that has been
acquired is held on a constructive trust for them. However, post-Durant the fact that the
wrongdoer uses a credit facility to acquire an asset is not a bar to a plaintiff being able to
trace. Provided there is a causal connection between the misappropriation and the acquisition of the asset, the formal intricacies of the transaction do not matter. If there is evidence
of an intention on the part of the wrongdoer, in misappropriating the funds to use them to
acquire an asset and a credit card or credit facility is interposed in the purchase, the misapplied funds that are used to discharge the liability of the wrongdoer owed to the bank or
card issuer is not a bar to a tracing claim.

C. Backwards or 'Reverse' Tracing
13-86

The concept of backwards or 'reverse' tracing has arisen as a possible means to combat two
circumstances, which are largely separate although they can be interrelated, which are usually fatal to the possibility of tracing leading to a proprietary claim at all:
1.
2.

13-87

payment of trust money into an overdrawn account; and
where the defaulting fiduciary deposits trust money into an account after the defaulting fiduciary has drawn against the account to acquire an asset.

Both (1) and (2) above are techniques often exploited by fraudsters who are able to either
manipulate the timing of payments between bank accounts such that monies imbued with
a trust are credited to an account after an equivalent or related amount has been debited
from that account but also by interposing at least one overdrawn bank account into a chain
through which trust money is in transit between its source and eventual depository. The
technique of reverse tracing as a means to counter either (1) or (2) is controversial because
it violates the principle that a beneficiary can only trace into money that represents property that beneficially belonged to him. In Jersey, Durant has held that (2) is not an insurmountable bar to a beneficiary being able to trace. The Court did not endorse wholesale
adoption of the concept of backwards tracing into Jersey law but suggested that any objection to the practice was indicative only of the need to establish a sufficient link between the
original property and its traceable proceeds. It follows that where a sufficient link can be
found, a formal process of 'backwards tracing' is not required.

When Assets Become Untraceable

525

The rule in English law is that trust money cannot be traced into an asset bought before the
money was misappropriated from the trust since the asset bought does not represent the
trust money.145 Under English law, the plaintiff is limited to asserting a claim against
the account for the 'lowest intermediate balance' that his money has fallen to between the
date of the deposit of his money and the subsequent deposit of the trustee's own money.
Jersey has rejected the lowest intermediate balance approach has the status of a formal rule
and held that it was simply another aspect of requiring a beneficiary to establish a sufficient
link between the original property and its traceable proceeds.146 This result is said to be
consistent with the general presumptions operating in cases of mixture: the subsequent
deposit of the trustee's otherwise 'clean money' does not originate from either the mixed
fund or the trust money, and so the trustee can easily displace the evidential presumption
that it is attributable to the plaintiff beneficiaries.147
The English rule that tracing will be defeated by payments into an overdrawn account is
not without controversy. One can readily imagine a situation, in which a fiduciary or other
recipient, who is £5,000 overdrawn, pays £4,000 of trust money into the account and then
the next day buys an asset for £3,000 out of the account. As a matter of English law, notwithstanding the payment into the account enabled the trustee to use his overdraft facility
to buy the asset, the money paid into the account went to reduce the debt to the bank and
not to pay for the asset and therefore cannot be traced into the new asset.148 Perhaps mindful of the fact that a defendant should not be able to benefit by creating a maelstrom so as
to obfuscate the ability of the plaintiff to follow the path of the money and mindful of the
need to avoid a perception that Jersey affords any safe harbour to fraudsters or those who
seek to hide money from those who have a legitimate claim upon it, the Royal Court in
Durant resoundingly rejected what it referred to as the 'conceptual' limitations in the
English tracing rules. The Royal Court in paragraph 219 of its judgment said:
The appropriate way for the courts of this jurisdiction to address the subject is, we suggest, not by
reference to any pre-conceptions of what is or is not conceptually possible or arguably supported
by English authority, but … as a matter of evidence-at least in cases where, as here, the account in
question remains in credit throughout the relevant period, there is no question of possible insolvency and prejudice to unsecured creditors, and there is no suggestion of any intervention by a
bona fide purchaser for value. The question is, or should be, simply whether there is sufficient
evidence to establish a clear link between credits and debits to an account, irrespective (within a
reasonable time frame) of the order in which they occur or the state of the balance on the account.
It is unnecessary to posit any limitation on how, as a matter of evidence the necessary link can be
proved: it might be by means of bank documentation … or by reference to the defendant accountholders' intentions or in some other way. Nor is there any cause to diminish the effect of such a link,
once recognised, by introducing the concept of a 'lowest intermediate balance rule'. As a matter of
judicial policy, this approach appears to us to accord most closely with considerations of justice
and practicality. Apart from anything else, to do otherwise would … confer on any sophisticated

145 Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan (n 99) although in Durant it was open to the plaintiff to
suggest that this was in fact the intention of the defendant in order to establish a sufficient link between the original property and its traceable proceeds notwithstanding the difficulties in being able to follow the precise path of
the money because of the order of payments.

13-90

13-91

13-92

13-93

It remains to be seen how this broad statement of principle will be developed in future
cases. By the Court's own admission the relevant accounts to which the tracing exercise was
subject in Durant remained in credit throughout the relevant period, therefore the Court's
apparent endorsement of the technique of 'reverse tracing' does not extend to situation
(1) above (payment of trust money into an overdrawn account). If in a future case monies subject to a trust are deposited in an account that is overdrawn there will have to be a
determination as to whether the deposit is the bank's money or the plaintiff beneficiary's,
no matter how clear the evidence may be.
Durant does not explore whether it is the subjective or the objective intention of the wrongdoer that is necessary to establish evidence of a coordinated scheme. We assume it is sufficient to show an objective intention on the part of the fiduciary. It is less clear what is to
happen were a trustee to establish that subjectively he did not intend to use the misapplied
funds to acquire an asset, but a court were to hold that objectively such intention might be
inferred by a reasonable observer, cognisant of all the circumstances of the transaction. In
practice the heavy burden of the wrongdoer's fiduciary obligations will serve to act against
the wrongdoer, establishing the necessary link.
As a possible alternative to backwards tracing, it seems at least arguable that where trust
money is used to discharge a debt incurred by the trustee for the purpose of acquiring a
specific asset, and the debt or the loan is repaid out of trust money, a beneficiary can trace
into the repayment of a debt or loan so as to give him a remedy of a proprietary character
by way of subrogation to the seller's lien (in the case of an asset provided on credit) or a
lender's right of security.149 Such a remedy is of course quite different in character from a
proprietary remedy: with the beneficiary not seeking to vindicate his own rights in the trust
money but rather seeking to avail himself of someone else's security rights through subrogation. There is no objection to tracing being used in aid of such a remedy.150 Whether it
is possible for a plaintiff beneficiary to be subrogated to the rights of a mortgagee of Jersey
land in this fashion is unclear, English law principles do not readily apply to a system of
real property that is peculiar to Jersey. In Durant, it was suggested that, proving the implied
intention of the defendant to reimburse the depleted trust fund or acquire an asset in the
expectation of receiving money imbued with trust would be a sufficient, but not necessarily
the only way of establishing a sufficient link between the original assets and their traceable
proceeds.151
A fiduciary agent who uses the principal's money to pay a secured debt cannot say that he
paid out the principal's money otherwise than for the benefit of the principal.152 A similar
analysis would apply to the case of a trustee (or other wrongdoer) who uses trust money to
pay off the trustee's (or wrongdoer's) own secured debt: the trustee must be taken as having
paid off the debt for the benefit of the beneficiary and accordingly the beneficiary should

have an equitable remedy by way of subrogation so as to preserve the benefit of the secured
debt for the beneficiary, as the trustee (or wrongdoer) who paid off the debt must be taken
to have intended.153 A subrogation claim against a Diplock recipient may be founded on
the principle that subrogation reverses or prevents unjust enrichment,154 and that since the
payment in discharge of the secured debt enriches the Diplock recipient at the expense of
the beneficiary, and the enrichment is unjust because the secured debt was discharged with
the beneficiary's money, the remedy should be available irrespective of the intentions of the
Diplock recipient, subject to change of position defence.

XII. 'Equity's Darling'-a bona fides Purchaser for Value
without Notice
A purchaser with actual notice of the trust to which property is subject is bound to the
same extent and in the same manner as the person from whom he bought irrespective of
what type of notice the purchaser has, whether he has paid full value. Conversely, a bona
fides purchaser for value of a without actual notice of the trust has an absolute defence
to any claim, whether proprietary or personal by the beneficiaries in relation to the trust
property that has been misappropriated in breach of trust. Purchase without actual notice
is a defence to an action by the plaintiff beneficiaries; it is for the purchaser to discharge the
burden of proving both that he gave value and that he had no notice.
Article 55 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 provides;155

13-94

13-95

55 Protection to persons dealing with trustee
(1) A bona fide purchaser for value without actual notice of any breach of trust-
(a) may deal with a trustee in relation to trust property as if the trustee was the beneficial
owner of the trust property; and
(b) shall not be affected by the trusts on which such property is held.
(2) No person paying or advancing money to a trustee shall be concerned to see that such money is
wanted, or that no more than is wanted is raised, or otherwise as to the propriety of the transaction
or the application of the money.

Article 55 has never, since the enactment of 1984 legislation, been subject to judicial consideration by the Royal Court. It is the authors' view that English law may be referred to
in interpreting the various concepts mentioned therein. A person dealing with a trustee in Jersey law is afforded a comparatively generously latitude (compared with English
law which includes the doctrine of constructive notice) in being able to take free of any

153 That the trustee should be not be permitted to maintain that his intention was to destroy the debt is consistent with Re Hallett's Estate (n 27) at 726 et seq; and Re Oatway (n 60). See too Bishopsgate Investment Management

beneficial interest attaching to property in the hands of the trustee provided they have no
actual notice of a breach of trust.

A. A Purchase for Value
13-97

There must be a purchase for a consideration156 in money or money's worth, but there is
no requirement of full value having to be paid. It is unclear whether the Jersey law doctrine
of déception d'outre moitié de juste prix applies to the transaction between the trustee and
third party purchaser and it is likely to depend on the law governing the transaction. If the
principle does apply, the English decisions suggesting that a purchase for a small fraction
of the true value of the property concerned suffices to support the defence157 may be put
into doubt. A purchase for value includes the discharge of an existing debt. A purchase price
consisting of money must actually be paid, it seems in full. This requirement rules out the
defence being available to volunteers; however, a volunteer may benefit from the defence if
they derive title from a purchaser who satisfies the requirements of the defence.

B. Purchase in Good Faith or bona fides
13-98

While the requirement of good faith is, in English law, closely allied to the requirement of
notice (the English authorities suggesting that not only absence of notice but genuine and
honest absence of notice is required)158 good faith remains an independent threshold which
must be satisfied even though absence of actual notice is proved.159 There are no reported
cases where the requirement of absence of notice has been established but the requirement
of good faith has not.160

C. Without Notice
13-99

In Jersey law, only actual notice will suffice.161 Actual notice no doubt also includes knowledge which would have been acquired but for wilfully shutting one's eyes to the obvious,
or wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man
would make.162 Jersey law does not admit of a concept of constructive notice by which a

law and in Jersey contract law, the French concept of 'cause' has a greater pedigree.

purchaser is taken to have notice of what would have come to his knowledge if such inquiries and inspections had been made as ought reasonably (meaning ought as a matter of prudence, having regard to what is usually done by men of business in similar circumstances)
to have been made by him.163 Actual notice also includes a fact contained in or indicated by
some document in the possession of the purchaser, whether or not read or remembered.164
An agent who has actual notice will impute notice to his principal. The attribution of an
individual's to a company is considered elsewhere.165

i. Notice of Doubtful Claims on the Property
If an equitable interest is so doubtful or uncertain that it can only be established by a decision of the Court, knowledge that a claim is being made to it does not necessarily amount
to notice of the equity such as can bind a purchaser even if the claim is subsequently found
to be good.166

13-100

ii. Notice and Trustees of Multiple Trusts
Owing to the proliferation of large, institutional trust companies in Jersey, the following
provision in the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 contains the following provision, which is of relevance in any consideration of notice.

13-101

31 Trustee acting in respect of more than one trust167
(1) A trustee acting for the purposes of more than one trust shall not, in the absence of fraud, be
affected by notice of any instrument, matter, fact or thing in relation to any particular trust if the
trustee has obtained notice of it by reason of the trustee's acting or having acted for the purposes
of another trust.

Notice, consistent with Article 55 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, means actual notice. The
effect of the provision means that a trust company, formerly trustee of trust A, could purchase trust property from the new trustee of trust A on behalf of trust B, and would take
free of beneficial interests under trust A, if its only knowledge of them was acquired as its
former trustee.

iii. No Notice at the Time of Transfer of the Legal Estate
The purchaser must have no actual notice, at the time of the purchase. If the purchaser
acquires notice after the acquisition, then he can avail himself of the defence, which will be
available to his successors in title as well.

iv. Purchasers without Notice from a Purchaser with Notice and Purchasers with
Notice from a Purchaser without Notice
13-104

The defence is still available where the original purchase is tainted by having actual notice
but a subsequent purchase is not. A purchaser without notice from a purchaser with notice
takes free of the trust. The want of good faith in the original or prior purchaser does not
contaminate subsequent purchasers. A purchaser who takes the legal estate without actual
notice of the trust, but taking it from a person who had notice of the trust by virtue of an
instrument, but of which instrument the purchaser was ignorant at the time of purchase,
can protect himself as a purchaser without notice.168 A purchaser with notice of the trust
from a purchaser without notice takes free of the trust notwithstanding his notice. The first
purchaser without notice has already extinguished the beneficiaries' interest in the property.169 Bar one exception, anyone claiming under a bona fides purchaser for value without
notice takes free of the trust. That exception arises where the trustee sells to a bona fides
purchaser without notice and, subsequently, himself becomes the owner, even if he purchases for good and valuable consideration: the trust will revive as against the trustee.170

D. Governing Law
13-105

Whether a person can avail themselves of the defence of a purchase for value without notice
should be determined by reference to the lex situs in the case of immovable property, chattels and negotiable instruments. In relation to transfers of things in action it will be the law
governing where the thing is treated as being situated; and in the case of shares in particular,
the law of the place where the company was incorporated and where the shares are treated
as situated.171

Trust Property and the Proceeds
of Crime
I. Introduction
The idea that a trustee could be accountable to law enforcement authorities for the persons
with whom the trustee had dealt in the course of the administration of the trust and the
provenance of the trust assets1 was, until approximately 30 years ago, an anathema. That
position has now irrevocably changed in Jersey as a consequence of a raft of legislative
measures introduced from the late 1990s that are directed to protect the island's financial
services industry from being used as a safe harbour for nefarious funds, and to strengthen
the tools available to law enforcement authorities both in Jersey and abroad, to deal with
serious crime and terrorism. In addition to conventional criminal sanctions for the underlying criminal activity itself, there are now wide-ranging provisions that prohibit what
might broadly be described as 'dealing with' property that is or represents the proceeds of
criminal conduct and for seizing or confiscating it. A detailed examination of the criminal
law is beyond the scope of this work which is concerned, primarily, with trust litigation in
a civil context. Practitioners involved in trust litigation will primarily be concerned with
the consequences that Jersey's anti-money laundering(AML)/anti-terrorist financing (ATF)
regime has on the rights of beneficiaries and the powers and duties of trustees in respect of
the trust property as well as the civil and criminal and regulatory liability of trustees arising
from infringement of the AML/ATF legislation. Those carrying on trust company business
are subject to a requirement of registration as 'fit and proper' registered persons with the
Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) and must regard those to whom they provide
services and others with a healthy degree of suspicion, satisfying themselves (at least) of
their identity (and in the case of legal persons those individuals that stand behind them) as
well to the provenance of funds under their control.2

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

A. Primary Legislation
14-2

Jersey's legislative response to the threat of money laundering, while predating the UK's
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, has since largely followed the UK's,3 with a framework consisting of a handful of pieces of primary legislation under which secondary legislation and
guidance from the JFSC has been drawn up and promulgated. The first Jersey legislation
dealing explicitly with money laundering was the Drug Trafficking Offences (Jersey) Law
1988 (now repealed).4 The current legislative framework comprises a Proceeds of Crime
(Jersey) Law 1999 (as amended) and the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002. In addition to the
above, which may be regarded as the main prohibitive statutes, are five additional primary
legislative measures relevant to anti-money laundering and the obtaining of evidence,
namely: the Bankers Books Evidence (Jersey) Law 1986;5 the Investigation of Fraud
(Jersey) Law 1991;6 the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) (Jersey) Law 2001;7
the Proceeds of Crime (Cash Seizure) (Jersey) Law 20088 and the Civil Asset Recovery
(International Co-operation) (Jersey) Law 2007.9

B. Secondary Legislation
14-3

Both the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 and Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 are supplemented by the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008 (MLJO) which was introduced
specifically to target businesses listed in Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law
1999.10 The MLJO requires all businesses to which it applies (including those persons regulated by the JFSC to conduct trust company business) to establish risk-based procedures for
3 Amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 (taking effect from 4 August 2014) have reformulated the offences in Arts 29-34D to bring them into line with the UK's Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
4 Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Jersey) Law 2014.
5 Art 6, which provides that on the application of any party to a legal proceeding to which the bank is not a
party, the Royal Court may order that a party be at liberty to inspect and take copies of any entries in a bankers'
book for any of the purposes of such proceedings.
6 Which empowers HM Attorney General to require the production of documents and the provision of information for the purposes of assisting investigating authorities in matters of serious or complex fraud. On the
request of an overseas prosecuting authority, the AG may issue a notice to those thought to be in possession of
relevant documentation or information requiring copies of documents, or requiring that answers are provided to
questions relevant to the investigation.
7 Which provides for the service of overseas process in Jersey and for taking of formal evidence in Jersey for
the purposes of overseas criminal proceedings or investigations (thus going further than the Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) (Jersey) Order 1983. This legislation also enables warrants to be issued for the search
of premises and seizure of evidence in connection with any serious offence. Whereas Art 40 of the Proceeds of
Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 is limited to identifying and then tracing and recovering the proceeds of crime, the
powers under this law enable information to be obtained for the purposes of investigating the original offence. In
addition, this legislation allows for the enforcement of overseas orders for the forfeiture and destruction (or other
disposal) of anything used or intended for use in connection with a serious offence.
8 Which contains powers of civil forfeiture specifically in relation to tainted cash. No conviction is needed and
the Court would decide the matter on the balance of probabilities.
9 Which empowers the AG to require the production of evidence for use in civil recovery proceedings outside
of Jersey and a regime by which external civil asset recovery orders may be given effect to in Jersey. Considered
below at para 14-59.
10 A Private Trust Company exempted from the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 under the Trust Company
Business (Exemptions) (Jersey) Order 2000 is excluded from the definition of 'financial services business' to which
the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008 applies.

the purpose of forestalling or preventing money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism. The failure to establish and maintain such procedures is an offence.11 The supervision of the businesses covered by the MLJO is the responsibility of the JFSC.

C. JFSC Guidance
The JFSC has issued regulated sector-specific guidance in the form of a Handbook for the
Prevention and Detection of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism which
contains a section specifically for regulated trust company businesses.12 The handbook is
intended to represent best practice and while it does not have the force of law, for those in
the regulated sector (such as those carrying on trust company business) the guidance is
widely regarded as mandatory.

II. Jersey's Money Laundering Offences
Jersey's proceeds of crime legislation13 criminalises the following activities:
the acquisition, use of, possession or control of criminal property;14

1.
2.

entering into or otherwise being concerned in an arrangement knowing or suspecting
that the arrangement facilitates the acquisition, use, control or possession of criminal
property by another;15
concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing from Jersey any criminal
property (ie money laundering);16
tipping off the money launderer and/or his associates;17 and
failing to disclose knowledge or suspicion of money laundering.18

3.

5.

A trustee that receives and deals with trust property that is the proceeds of crime could find
itself at risk of criminal liability under any of the offences listed above.

The Commission has also issued handbooks for the legal sector containing important provisions relating to
legal professional privilege.

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

A. Proceeds of Crime
i. The Acquisition, Use, Control or Possession or Use of the Proceeds of Criminal
Property
14-6

The terms of the offence are set out at Article 30 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law
1999, which provides:
30 Offences of dealing with criminal property
(1) A person who -
(a) acquires criminal property;
(b) uses criminal property; or
(c) has possession or control of criminal property,
is guilty of an offence.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) -
(a)

having possession or control of property includes doing an act in relation to the property;
and
(b) it does not matter whether the acquisition, use, possession or control is for the person's own
benefit or for the benefit of another.

a. Criminal Property
14-7

'Criminal property' is defined19 as property20 that constitutes the proceeds of criminal conduct or represents such proceeds, whether in whole or in part and whether directly or indirectly. The proceeds of criminal conduct, in relation to any person who has benefited from
criminal conduct, means that benefit.21 It does not matter whether the criminal conduct
was conduct of the alleged offender or of another person, whether the person who benefited from the criminal conduct was the alleged offender or another person or whether
the criminal conduct occurred before or after the coming into force of this provision.22
'Property' means all property, whether movable or immovable, vested or contingent, and
whether situated in Jersey or elsewhere.23 Any property that in whole or in part directly
or indirectly represented in a person's hands his or her proceeds of criminal conduct also
comes within the definition of proceeds of criminal conduct.24

19

ibid, Art 29.

20 'Property' is defined widely in Art 1(1) to include all property, whether movable or immovable, or vested or

contingent, and whether in Jersey or elsewhere, including (a) any legal document or instrument evidencing title to
or interest in any such property; (b) any interest in or power in respect of any such property, and (c) in relation to
movable property, any right, including a right to possession.
21 Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 1(1). For the purposes of the 1999 Law, a person benefits from any
criminal conduct if that person obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct; including if the
person receives any payment or other reward in connection with such conduct, whether carried on by that person
or by another; Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 1(2A).
22 ibid, Art 29(2).
23 ibid, Art 1(1).
24 ibid, Art 31(2).

Jersey's Money Laundering Offences

535

b. Criminal Conduct
'Criminal conduct' is defined25 as conduct which constitutes an offence in Jersey for which
the person is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of at least one year26 or
conduct which if it occurs or has occurred outside Jersey (whether or not the person is
also liable to any other penalty) would have constituted an offence under Schedule 1 of the
1999 Law, if it had occurred in Jersey.27 A crime is included whether or not anyone has been
convicted of it, tried for it, or even charged with it. It is also irrelevant who carried out the
conduct and who benefited from it.28 Accordingly, they need not be the same people. Conduct is criminal conduct whether it was committed before or after the passing of the 1999
Law, though laundering its proceeds is not within the scope of the Law if the laundering was
committed before Part 3 of the Law was brought into force on 1 July 1999.29 In relation to
conduct which takes place outside Jersey, whether such conduct will constitute an offence
under the law of the jurisdiction in which it took place is not relevant provided it falls
within Schedule 1 of Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999. There is therefore no requirement for dual criminality in order for conduct to be criminal conduct for the purposes of
Jersey Law. It is to be noted that the definition of criminal conduct contains no temporal
limit and may therefore include a crime committed at any time before the enactment of
Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999.30

14-8

Tax-related Offences
No exemption or special category applies to tax-related offences as against any other kind
of criminal conduct; the question is simply whether a fiscal offence constitutes an offence
in Jersey for which a person is liable and on conviction would be liable for a term of imprisonment for more than one year. The penalty under Article 137 of the Income Tax (Jersey)
Law 1961 for fraudulently or negligently making incorrect statements in connection with
a tax return was, until 27 May 2009, a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment.31 Since
that date, offences under Article 137 that are committed fraudulently (ie tax evasion) are
imprisonable for a period of up to 15 years and as such fall within the scope of Schedule 1 of
the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999. The Royal Court has since held that offences committed prior to the change in the sentencing for such conduct are capable of falling with
the scope of Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 and amenable to domestic and external
confiscation regime notwithstanding that prior to May 2009 they would only have been

25

ibid, Art 1.
ibid, Sch 1. This includes all of Jersey's customary law offences and the more serious statutory offences.
27 The definition of criminal conduct excludes a drug trafficking or terrorism offence (which are dealt with
under the Drug Trafficking Offences (Jersey) Law 1988 and Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 respectively). This is a
narrower definition of criminal conduct than current applies in the UK under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

prior to commencement of Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 is admissible on a charge of money laundering to
show the accused had the requisite state of mind (ie knowing or suspecting that the third parties had been engaged
in or had benefited from criminal conduct) for offences committed after the coming into force of pt 3); see Michel
& Gallichan v AG [2006 JLR 287].

publishable by a fine.32 The Jersey Court of Appeal in Michel & Gallichan v AG33 confirmed
that tax evasion may also be prosecuted under the Jersey customary law offence of fraud.34
It is now settled that tax evasion, whether in Jersey or elsewhere, can constitute criminal
conduct for the purposes of the Jersey's money laundering offences.
Where the criminal conduct comprises the unlawful non-declaration of assets or income
for taxation purposes the property obtained from the criminal conduct is to be treated as
a pecuniary advantage equal to the tax charge not incurred on the non-declared funds.
Given the wide definitions of 'benefiting from any criminal conduct' includes obtaining property obtained in connection35 with criminal conduct, all of the undeclared funds
held in a Jersey bank account could constitute criminal property. In determining the benefit, the focus should be on the gross receipt of what the person has actually obtained as
a result of or in connection with the offence and not the profit net of expenses.36
A person who obtains a pecuniary advantage as a result of or in connection with the criminal
conduct (or in that and some other connection) is to be taken to obtain, as a result of
or in connection with the conduct, a sum of money equal to the value of the pecuniary
advantage.37
A trustee who accepts office as trustee and then goes on to become vested with assets that
he knows or could with reasonable due diligence have discovered are tainted as criminal
property, is prima facie guilty of an offence.38 It is the authors' view that the common practice used by offshore trustees by which the trustee does not hold trust property directly but
instead holds the property indirectly through a nominee corporate vehicle, either by acquisition of its shares or by way of bare trust, comes within the definition of 'acquisition, use or
possession'. The criminal property that is acquired, used or in the possession of the trustee
must have been the proceeds of criminal conduct before the act which is alleged to constitute the offence under Article 30; it is not enough that the property became criminal property only as a result of the trustee acquiring, using or having possession of the property.39
Knowledge or Suspicion

14-12

Property will not be criminal property unless the person accused under either Article 30 or
31 knows or suspects that the property constitutes or represents the proceeds of criminal
conduct.40 This is an important qualification to the breadth of the definition of criminal
property in Article 29(1)(b). However knowledge or suspicion is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for the property to be criminal property. It seems that the mere suspicion
that property is criminal property is insufficient and that it must be established as being so
before either Article 30 or 31 will bite.41 To be guilty of a money laundering offence under
Article 30, the offender (here meaning not the original person who carried out the criminal

conduct but the person, such as a trustee, acquiring using or possessing criminal property
or who is engaged in a prohibited arrangement facilitating its acquisition, use, possession or
control) must 'know or suspect' that the property constitutes proceeds of criminal conduct
or represents such proceeds, whether in whole or in part and whether directly or indirectly
or have benefited from criminal conduct. Suspicion is a difficult and amorphous concept.42
In recent years there has been a sustained period of heightened awareness of the risks of
money laundering which has led to a tendency among trustees to war-game a worst case
scenario approach to customers, making the prima facie threshold for suspicion a low one.
The English Court of Appeal43 has said that a person:
must think that there is a possibility, which is more than fanciful, that the relevant facts exist. But
the statute does not require the suspicion to be 'clear' or 'firmly grounded and targeted on specific
facts' or based on 'reasonable grounds

A mere feeling of unease has been held in England not to amount to a suspicion.44 It is the
authors' view that a trustee who wonders whether or not they should suspect money laundering but then decides that the circumstances do not raise any real suspicion will be able,
if necessary, to give honest and credible evidence that they did not suspect criminal proceeds. We do not consider that mere general mistrust of the source of the property would
amount to the kind of suspicion required. In a recent appeal to the Privy Council on the
construction of similar legislation in the Isle of Man45 it was held that reasonable grounds
for suspicion will not suffice in the absence of actual suspicion.

14-13

c. The Adequate Consideration Defence
It is a defence under Article 30(6) to prove that the person acquired or used the property or had control or possession of it for adequate consideration.46 This provision is an
example of Jersey's tendency to incorporate concepts into its legislation from neighbouring jurisdictions without making local adaptations.47 'Consideration', as understood in the
technical English sense of that term, is not a concept native to Jersey's customary law. In
Jersey law, the broader principle of cause48 stands in place of the role consideration plays
in English contract law. A person acquires property for inadequate consideration if the
value of the payment is significantly less than the value of the property and a person uses
or has possession of property for inadequate consideration if the value of the payment

42 See Oxford English Dictionary: 'to imagine something evil or wrong on slight or no evidence'. See also Hussien
v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at 948B, PC, per Lord Devlin: 'Suspicion in its ordinary meaning is a state of
conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: "I suspect but I cannot prove"'; no sufficient explanation for dealing
with large suspicious sums of money: Lloyd v AG 2004 JLR N[28].

1039, [2007] 1 WLR 311.

grounds [2010] EWCA Civ 31).
45 Holt v AG [2014] UKPC 4.
46 'Consideration' here is to be understood in the technical sense with which that term is used under English
law.
47 This provision is clearly copied from Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 329.
48 Broadly speaking, cause is the basis of or the reason for the contract. It is thus constituted by the interdependence of promises or the mutual performance of obligations; see Osment v Constable of St Helier 1974 JJ and Marett
v Marett [2008 JLR 384].

14-14

538

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

is significantly less than the value of the property acquired or the value of the person's
possession or use of it.49 However, the provision of services or goods for any person that are
of assistance to the person in their criminal conduct shall not be treated as consideration
for these purposes.50 The defence of having given adequate consideration will not avail a
trustee who accepts original property or assets subsequently settled into trust after it is first
established, because they give no consideration for such receipt. But for the offence to bite
at all the trustee would have to know or suspect that the trust assets they were accepting
were themselves, or represented, the proceeds of criminal conduct which would be a freestanding criminal offence under Article 30. A successor trustee is obliged to give reasonable
security (usually in the form of a contractual indemnity) to an outgoing or retiring trustee
in respect of any outstanding or contingent liabilities before that outgoing trustee can be
compelled to part with trust property.51 In the authors' view, this will amount to adequate
consideration. A trustee who purchases property, for example by changing investments, will
ordinarily be able to avail themselves of the defence if they give full consideration for the
new investments.

ii. Arrangements that Facilitate the Acquisition, Use, Control or Possession of
Criminal Property
14-15

The terms of the offence are set out at Article 30(3) of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law
1999, which provides:
30 Offences of dealing with criminal property
[…]
(3) A person who -
(a) enters into or becomes concerned in an arrangement; and
(b) knows or suspects that the arrangement facilitates, by any means, the acquisition, use, possession or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person,

a. Prohibited Arrangements
14-16

The arrangement must be entered into by the offender or be otherwise concerned with
it.52 An arrangement is prohibited if it facilitates, whether by concealment, removal from
the jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise (which we take as meaning 'by whatever means'), the retention or control of any person's criminal conduct by or on behalf
of another. Article 30(2)(b) provides that if the criminal property is placed at the disposal
of any person or is used for any person's benefit, whether or not to acquire any property
by way of an investment, then the arrangement is also prohibited. As can be seen, the

49

Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 33(7)(c).
ibid, Art 33(7)(a); note also Art 33(7)(b), which provides that the defence under Art 33(6) will not be available to a person providing property or services to another person if they know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds
to suspect that the property or services will or may assist the other person in criminal conduct even if they actually
do not.
51 Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, Art 34(2).
52 'Concerned with' is clearly wider than 'being a party to'.
50

Jersey's Money Laundering Offences

539

definition of an arrangement is extremely wide. A legally binding contract is not required.53
However, the property must have been criminal property as a result of some conduct occurring before the act which is alleged to constitute the offence under Article 30; it is not enough
that the property became criminal only as a result of carrying out the arrangement.54
A trust is an arrangement within the meaning of Article 30(3). If the trustee knows or
suspects that the settlor is using the trust as a receptacle for his criminal property then,
subject to the available defences, the trustee will contravene Article 30(1) by merely accepting the property. The exercise of a power of appointment, advancement or resettlement
from a trust is likely to be an arrangement.55 However, it has been held that the exercise of
a power of appointment of a successor protector and additional trustees in order to remove
a trust from Jersey to avoid restrictions under the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999
because the trustee was refusing to make a payment from the trust without police consent
after making a suspicious activity report) was held not to facilitate the retention or control
by the incoming trustees of the proceeds of criminal conduct (so as to be unlawful) or a
fraud on a power as the exercise was made in good faith in best interests of beneficiaries.56
The authors agree with the learned authors of Lewin on Trusts that lawyers are not to be
deemed as participating in a prohibited arrangement contrary to Article 30(3) merely by
conducting ordinary civil litigation, or by participating in a compromise of proceedings,
even if the subject matter of the proceedings includes or is tainted by criminal property, and
in any case the client's legal professional privilege is not prejudiced.57

14-17

B. Offence of Money Laundering
Unlike the offences under Article 30(1) and 30(3) of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law
1999 the offence in Article 31 criminalises money laundering proper. The terms of the
offence are as follows:
31 Concealment etc. of criminal property
(1) A person who -
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

conceals criminal property;
disguises criminal property;
converts or transfers criminal property; or
removes criminal property from Jersey,

is guilty of an offence.

Will Trusts [1960] Ch 407 at 419.

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

As with the offences under Article 30, criminal property that is concealed, disguised etc
must have become criminal property as a result of some conduct occurring before the act
or acts which are alleged to constitute the offence under Article 31 take place; the offence is
not made out if the property became criminal only as a result of concealing or disguising
otherwise 'clean' property, as yet untainted by criminality.58 Concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing are to be read as disjunctive alternative particulars of
the offence of money laundering. Reference to concealing or disguising property includes
concealing or disguising its nature, source, location, disposition, movement or ownership
or any rights with respect to it.59 It is to be noted that the concealment, disguising etc need
not be directed for any particular purpose.

C. Defences
14-20

14-21

It is a defence to any act which would otherwise constitute an offence under either Article
30 or Article 31 if a person who would otherwise be committing an offence under those
provisions makes a disclosure (known as a suspicious activity report or 'SAR') to a police
officer.60 The disclosure must consist of either the fact of his or her suspicion or belief that
any property constitutes or represents proceeds of criminal conduct (including any matter
on which such suspicion or belief is based); or of information, for the purposes of a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings in Jersey.61 If a SAR is made before the person
making the disclosure does anything that would otherwise be prohibited under Article 30
and 31, provided they have the consent of a police officer in advance, the consent will operate as a complete defence.62 A defence is also available if a SAR is made after the person
making the disclosure does anything that would otherwise be prohibited under Article 30
or 31 provided the disclosure is made on the person's initiative and as soon as it is reasonably practicable after the person has done the act in question.63
There is no offence if the offender either did not actually know or suspect that the arrangement related to any person's proceeds of criminal conduct or did not actually know or
suspect that the retention or control of said property was facilitated by the arrangement.64
A defence also exists if an offender intended to disclose to a police officer a suspicion, belief
or matter under Article 30(3) in relation to the arrangement and there is reasonable excuse
for the person's failure to have done so.65 These latter defences are rarely relied upon by

60 ibid, Art 32(3). A police officer for these purposes includes a member of the island's Honorary Police, a member of the States of Jersey Police Force, the Agent of the Impôts or any other officer of the Impôts; however, a SAR
is usually delivered to the Joint Financial Crimes Unit ('JFCU'), a joint police and customs unit with the States of
Jersey Police Force with responsibility for combating financial crime within Jersey. Where knowledge or suspicion
comes to an employee, their obligations are satisfied if they make the appropriate disclosure to the relevant Money
Laundering Reporting Officer within their organisation; see Art 32(5).

trustees in preference to the disclosure procedure because they are only engaged when a
crime has already been committed and a trustee is unlikely to run the risk that it may not
discharge the burden in proving its defence. A disclosure made under Article 32 will not
constitute an offence of tipping off under Article 35 or constitute an actionable breach of
any restriction on the disclosure of information.66

D. The Informal Freeze
A SAR effectively results in property known or suspected to be criminal property being
informally frozen pending consent by the JFCU. The person making the SAR cannot proceed to deal with the property without committing an offence and cannot inform the person whose property is suspected to be the proceeds of crime (or anyone else) because of
the prohibition on tipping off.67 The requirement for JFCU consent to proceed with what
would otherwise be an offence under Article 30 gives rise to a significant practical problem
for trustees.68 Unlike the equivalent UK legislation that provides a time limit by which
consent must be refused,69 or how the power of consent or refusal is to be exercised, Jersey's
proceeds of crime regime places no effective put-up-or-shut-up requirement on the JFCU
as to whether it will take steps to investigate or prosecute the underlying offences, resulting
in a freeze on the property of potentially indefinite duration. The Jersey Court of Appeal
in Gichuru v States of Jersey Police70 confirmed that two legal avenues are available to challenge an informal freeze of funds resulting from a SAR to which the police refuse consent
to deal (although significant doubts remain as to their effectiveness). The possible alternatives are, first, a civil action for debt against the financial institution, and/or, secondly, a
judicial review of the police's refusal to consent. It is to be noted that although these two
alternatives are directed at the same ultimate objective-freeing funds-they involve different issues and different parties. A judicial review action is concerned with (as the case may
be) the illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety71 of the police's refusal to consent,
which would not be in issue in the civil proceedings, while a civil claim for debt will not
quash the police's refusal to consent and so a taint may still hang over the funds suspected
of being the proceeds of criminal conduct. The burden and threshold to defeat a debt claim
would be on the financial institution to show on the balance of probabilities that by paying the funds it would be committing a money laundering offence. Further, if a financial
institution party to civil proceedings allows a customer to obtain a decision in his favour
without having maintained a proper defence so as to get itself off the hook, it will not have
fulfilled its obligations under the law72 and, accordingly, any decision of the court in ordering payment to the customer may not protect the financial institution from future criminal

proceedings against it. Clearly, if a regulated person does not know its client, it is not going
to be in a position to take 'such steps as are reasonable' to defend any proceedings. In such
circumstances, were the court to make an order directing payment away of funds, such an
institution may become liable on two fronts, not simply for having paid away monies, but
also for having failed to comply with applicable anti-money laundering regulations in the
first place.

III. Jersey's Anti-Terrorism Finance Offences
14-23

The Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 creates offences of laundering 'terrorist property'73
that are designed to mirror those created by the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999
concerning 'criminal property'; however, the 2002 Law relies on a different formulation,
focusing on the destination or use of property rather than its source. 'Terrorist property'
includes any property, wholly or partly, and directly or indirectly that is likely to be used for
the purposes of terrorism or for the support of a terrorist entity.74 This formulation creates
a practical difficulty for trustees, as a trustee may be in difficulty knowing how an appointment of trust property may be used after they have parted with it.

A. 'Terrorism'
14-24

Terrorism is defined75 by reference to the use or threat of action anywhere in the world that
is intended or may reasonably be regarded as intended to influence, coerce or compel the
States of Jersey or any other government or an international organisation to do or refrain
from doing any act or to intimidate the public or a section of the public in Jersey or elsewhere, and is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological
cause. Action so designed and purposed is within the definition if it:76
(a)

is intended to cause the death of, or serious injury to, a person not taking an active
part in hostilities in a situation of armed conflict;
(b) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public;
(c) involves serious damage to property;
(d) seriously disrupts or seriously interferes with any electronic system or the provision of
any service directly relating to communications infrastructure, banking and financial
services, public utilities, transportation or other infrastructure;
(e) seriously disrupts or seriously interferes with the provision of emergency police, fire
and rescue or medical services; or
(f) involves prejudice to national security or national defence.
73

Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 3(1).
ibid, Art 3.
75 ibid, Art 2.
76 A reference to any action taken for the purposes of terrorism includes a reference to action taken for the
benefit or support by way of providing or subsidising educational or other day-to-day living expenses of a terrorist
entity; ibid, Art 1(3).
74

Jersey's Anti-Terrorism Finance Offences

543

The use or threat of action falling within Article 2(2)(a)-(f) that involves the use of firearms
or explosives is terrorism whether or not it is designed to influence the government or an
international organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public. The handful of offences contained in Schedule 10 to the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 also amount to
terrorism for these purposes although these offences will amount to terrorism even if the
acts of which they comprise of do come within Article 2(2).

14-25

B. 'Terrorist Property'
'Terrorist property'77 is property which is intended to be used or likely to be used, in whole
or in part, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of terrorism or for the support of a terrorist entity; and includes, but is not limited to, the resources of a terrorist entity.78 It is to
be noted that Jersey's legislation does not include within its definition of terrorist property
any property which wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, represents the proceeds of the
commission of acts of terrorism (including payments or other rewards in connection with
its commission) or the proceeds of acts carried out for the purposes of terrorism.79

14-26

C. 'Terrorist Entity'
A 'terrorist entity'80 is one that commits, prepares or instigates an act of terrorism or facilitates the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. An entity will still
be a terrorist entity whether or not a specific act of terrorism is committed or, if an act of
terrorism is in fact committed, whether or not it is committed by an entity charged with an
offence under the 2002 Law or any other enactment, or by a related entity. 'Entity' includes
an organisation (whether or not proscribed), and a legal or natural person. An entity is a
'related entity' if (1) one entity directs or controls another; or (2) one entity participates
as an accomplice in the acts of another; or (3) one entity contributes to the commission
of acts by the other intentionally and with the knowledge of the intention of the other to
commit such acts.81

14-27

D. Proscribed Organisations
Any organisation proscribed under section 3 of the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 will also be
a proscribed organisation for the purposes of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002.82 Jersey
may also itself proscribe organisations under Article 6 of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002.
To date, there are 82 international terrorist organisations that have been proscribed under
77

ibid, Art 3.
The reference to 'resources' includes reference to any property which is applied or made available, or is
intended to be applied or made available, for use by a terrorist entity; see Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 3(2).
79 Cf Terrorism Act 2000, s 14 although the proceeds of the commission of terrorist acts will be 'criminal
property' for the purposes of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999.

this provision. The list of prescribed organisations in Schedule 1 of the 2002 Law may be
amended from time to time by order of the Minister for Home Affairs.

E. Offences Relating to Terrorist Financing
14-29

Jersey's offences relating to terrorist financing comprise two sets of offences: under
Article 15 relating broadly to the 'use and possession, provision etc. of property for
purposes of terrorism'; and offences under Article 16 relating to otherwise 'dealing' with
terrorist property. The offences under Articles 15 and 16 have extra-territorial effect.83 It is
therefore not a defence that the acts which constitute the offence were done outside Jersey.

i. Use and Possession etc of Property for Purposes of Terrorism
14-30

By virtue of Article 15 of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 it is an offence, punishable by
a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment or a fine, or both, for a person to use84
property for the purposes of terrorism or for the support of a terrorist entity. It is also an
offence under the same provision to either possess terrorist property, or to provide, or invite
another to provide terrorist property or a financial service, or to collect or receive terrorist property, intending knowing, suspecting, or having reasonable grounds to suspect that
the property or financial service be used for the purposes of terrorism or for the support
of a terrorist entity. This provision poses a particular risk to trustees of funds for charitable purposes or private purpose trusts85 who may find themselves in contravention of
these provisions if trust property is applied for a particular use or purpose. Note it is not a
requirement of the offence that the property be 'terrorist property'. While it is assumed that
trustees do not themselves intend their trust funds to be used for terrorist purposes, trustees
of a fund could find themselves in danger, especially in view of the wording about suspicion
if, for example, they distribute funds for the relief of poverty in some troubled corner of the
world and find that the money has been distributed to a person there who was poor but was
subsequently used to finance terrorism.

ii. '… has reasonable cause to suspect that …'
14-31

This formulation of the mental element necessary to make out the offence is different from
that used in the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, which requires actual knowledge or
suspicion.86 The Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 requires only that the accused has reasonable cause to suspect. As an accused must 'have' the cause to suspect, the facts that should
reasonably have aroused his suspicion presumably need to have come to his attention, but
they need not have aroused any actual suspicion in his mind-the test is an objective not
a subjective one. The offence will have been committed even though the accused does not
draw the conclusion that could reasonably be drawn, that the property 'may be used … for
the purposes of terrorism'. The words 'may be used' widens the scope of the offence even
83

ibid, Art 17.
Including use in whole or in part, directly or indirectly; see Art 15(3)(a).

86 See Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 30(3).
84

Jersey's Anti-Terrorism Finance Offences

545

further, although it is difficult to see a difference between suspecting that property will
be used in a given way and suspecting that it may be so used-any property may be used
for terrorism. Presumably some degree of foreseeability and proximity is required for the
offence to be committed, but if a distribution is in fact used for terrorist purposes, that will
in hindsight establish that it might have been so used, and a trustee who did not foresee
that when he accepted it into the trust fund would be left having to explain why he failed
to foresee it. Trustees must therefore exercise extreme caution in accepting property, and be
continuously vigilant in considering how it 'may' be used by those to whom it is distributed.

iii. Providing Property or Financial Services that May be Used for Terrorism
Article 15(2)(a) of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 criminalises the provision of money or
other property or financial services87 knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect that it
will or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. The reference to the provision of money
or other property is 'a reference to its being given, lent or otherwise made available, whether
or not for consideration'.88 An appointment of capital or income from a trust to a beneficiary is a provision of money or other property on the part of the trustee. A trustee who
makes a distribution and 'has reasonable cause to suspect' that the beneficiary 'may' use it to
finance the purchase of material for a bomb to be detonated for some political or religious
purpose, will commit an offence. Note that the offence will have been committed even if
the fund is entirely clean; the appointment out does not have to be 'terrorist property'. By
simply acting as a trustee (or more accurately, by 'carrying out trust company business')89
a person will also have committed an offence under this provision, if they know or have
reasonable cause to suspect that such services may be used for the purposes of terrorism.

14-32

iv. Dealing with Terrorist Property
In a similarly broad drafting style to the preceding article, under Article 16 of the Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 it is an offence, punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years'
imprisonment or a fine, or both, for a person to do any act90 which facilitates the retention
or control of terrorist property; to conceal or disguise terrorist property;91 to remove terrorist property from Jersey;92 or to transfer terrorist property to nominees. It is a complete
defence to prove on the balance of probabilities that a person did not know, suspect or had
no reasonable grounds to suspect that the purpose of the relevant act or omission was to
facilitate the retention or control of terrorist property; or that they did not know, suspect
or had no reasonable grounds to suspect the property in question was terrorist property.93

87 Defined in the Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Jersey) Law 2011, Art 3. Note that the provision of any service
falling within the definition of 'financial service business' in Art 2 of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 is
also included.
88 Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 15(3)(b).
89 Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998, Art 2.
90 An act also includes an omission to do something; see Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 16(4).
91 Reference to concealing or disguising property includes concealing or disguising its nature, source, location,
disposition, movement or ownership or any rights with respect to it; see Art 16(5).
92 Or a country or place outside Jersey; see Art 17(2).
93 Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002, Art 16(2).

14-33

546

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

We are assuming that the trustees would not knowingly harbour terrorist property, but terrorist property is defined widely and the test of reasonable cause to suspect is an objective
one. The trustee's position is more difficult under Article 16 than under Article 15 because
under Article 16 the onus is on the trustee to prove a negative-that they had no reasonable
cause to suspect terrorist property. However, because the trustee only needs to prove that
they had no grounds for thinking that the trust property was likely to be used for the purpose of terrorism, a theoretical or fanciful possibility that some beneficiary might one day
unexpectedly join in some terrorist operation will not be sufficient to make out the offence
against the trustee.

F. A Trustee Accepting Trust Property Must Take Necessary Precautions
14-34

It is insufficient that the trustee knows the identity of the settlor. The trustee must
enquire and satisfy themselves as to the source of the funds intended to be the subject
matter of the trust. The trustee should consult the official list94 of proscribed terrorist groups
or organisations, Jersey's list of financial sanctions targets and persons subject to restrictive
measures and the list of designated persons under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Jersey) Law
2011.95 If the settlor is a 'politically exposed person' (PEP) or an immediate family member,
or person known to be closely associated, with such a person, the trustee will be required
to undertake enhanced due diligence.96 If, having made reasonable enquiries, a trustee is
satisfied concerning the identity of the settlor and the source of funds, but yet in fact the
trust property turns out to be the proceeds of criminal conduct, no offence will have been
committed because the trustee will not have any actual knowledge or suspicion that it was
the proceeds of crime.97 They should make and preserve a record of their enquiries, so that,
if necessary, they can rebut any suggestion that they had such actual knowledge or suspicion. If the trustees are not satisfied by their enquiries, they should decline to accept office
as trustee.

IV. Disclosure and Non-disclosure
14-35

Article 34A-34D of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 and Articles 19 and 21 of the
Terrorism (Jersey) Law 2002 effectively impose a positive duty to inform the authorities
about dealings with criminal or terrorist property and make it an offence in its own right to
fail to make the required disclosure. There are two schemes of offences for failing to make a
disclosure: the first applies generally where the knowledge or suspicion arises in the course
of a person's trade, profession, business or employment98 and the second, distinct regime,
94 Available from the JFSC.

95 Being (1) a person who is the subject of a designation, being a designation within the meaning of the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc Act 2010; or (2) a natural or legal person, group or entity included in the list (as in force from
time to time) provided for by Art 2(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001.

applies to financial services businesses99 and financial institutions.100 Both pieces of primary legislation also impose restrictions, backed by criminal penalties, on tipping off those
suspected of involvement in money laundering or terrorist financing about any investigations and proceedings brought against them.

A. Duties of Disclosure
The terms of Article 34A are as follows:

14-36

34A Failure to disclose knowledge or suspicion of money laundering101
(1) This Article applies where -
(a) a person ('A') knows or suspects that another person is engaged in money laundering;102 and
(b) the information or other matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based comes to A's
attention in the course of A's trade, profession, business or employment.
(1A) Where this Article applies, A must disclose, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph (1B) -
(a) the knowledge or suspicion mentioned in paragraph (1)(a); and
(b) the information or other matter mentioned in paragraph (1)(b),
and if A does not make such a disclosure, A commits an offence.

Article 34A criminalises a failure to report knowledge or suspicion of an offence under
Articles 30 or 31.103 This provision excludes from its ambit a failure to disclose information that comes to a lawyer in circumstances of legal professional privilege.104 Statutory
exemption is provided by Article 34A(3) to the effect that a disclosure under Article 34A
will not be treated as a breach of any restriction imposed by statute, contract or otherwise.
It is therefore not a defence to a charge under Article 34A of failure to report knowledge or
suspicion of money laundering owing to a concern about confidentiality or confidence. The
only defences available to a charge under Article 34A are that there was a reasonable excuse
for not making the appropriate reporting105 or that, in the case of a person in employment,
the person disclosed the information or other matter in question to the appropriate person
in accordance with the procedure established by the person's employer for the making of
such disclosures.106 If A fails to make a disclosure to a designated police officer, a designated

101 Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 34A does not apply to information or other matter that comes to
a person, as an employer or employee, in the course of the carrying on of a financial services business; see Arts 34C
and 34D for an offence of non-reporting specifically applicable to the regulated financial sector.
102 Defined to include contrary to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law, Arts 30 and 31 or of the Terrorism
(Jersey) Law 2002, Arts 15 and 16 or knowledge of conduct outside Jersey which, if occurring in Jersey, would be
an offence under those provisions; Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 1(1).

customs officer or a nominated officer107 for cases falling within Article 34D) in good faith,
as soon as is practicable after the information or other matter came to A's attention, A will
commit an offence.108 What is required to be disclosed is the fact of A's knowledge or suspicion of money laundering and the information on which A's knowledge or suspicion is
based.
34D Failure in a financial institution to report to designated police officer, designated customs
officer or nominated officer
(1) This Article applies where the conditions in both paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) are fulfilled.
(2) The first condition is that a person ('A') knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds for suspecting that -
(a) another person is engaged in money laundering; or
(b) any property constitutes or represents proceeds of criminal conduct.
(3) The second condition is that the information or other matter on which A's knowledge or suspicion is based, or which gives reasonable grounds for such suspicion, came to A in the course of the
carrying on of a financial services business.109
(4) Where this Article applies, A must disclose, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph (4A) -
(a) the knowledge, suspicion or grounds for suspicion mentioned in paragraph (2); and
(b) the information or other matter mentioned in paragraph (3),
and if A does not make such a disclosure, A commits an offence.

14-38

This is effectively the same offence as that in Article 34A of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey)
Law 1999 but applicable only to financial services businesses as defined by Jersey legislation.110 The key question for a practitioner with reason to consider this offence is whether
the knowledge or suspicion comes to a person in the course of the carrying on of a financial
services business, as defined. In deciding whether a person has committed an offence under
this article, the court shall take account of any relevant Code of Practice or guidance that
applies to that person or the business carried on by that person issued by the JFSC.111 If
each of the conditions is satisfied and no disclosure is made, the only defences available
are: (1) that the person has a reasonable excuse for not disclosing the information or other
matter;112 (2) the information is otherwise protected by legal professional privilege;113 or

107 A person nominated by the employer of the person making the disclosure to receive disclosures under Art
34D of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999; see Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 34D(8)(a).
108 ibid, Art 34A(1A).
109 Defined by Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 36(1) as the list of businesses in Sch 2 to the 1999 Law.
The exemption of a private trust company business in para 4(d) to that schedule is to be noted. Such an entity
would still come within the scope of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 34A.
110 It is to be contrasted with the conditions that must be satisfied under Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 330;
note esp the absence of an equivalent to s 330(3A) in the Jersey legislation.

Law 2008. Failure to comply with Code of Practice or guidance issued by the Commission or conviction for an
offence relating to money laundering are grounds on which the Commission may revoke a registered person's
status at any time.

(3) the person is an employee in a financial services business, does not actually know or
suspect that another person is engaged in money laundering, and he has not been provided
by the person carrying on the financial services business with such training as is specified
under the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008.114

B. Restrictions on Disclosure-Anti-tipping off
In order to prevent a risk of prejudice to any investigation of money laundering (which may
or may not have been instigated by a disclosure made under Articles 32, 34A or 34D), Article
35 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 criminalises disclosure of any information
relating to or likely to be relevant to such an investigation115 or to disclose to another person
either the fact that such a disclosure has been or will be made, or any information otherwise
relating to such a disclosure116 or to otherwise to interfere with material117 which is likely to
be relevant to an investigation resulting from such a disclosure.118 The offence in Article 35
applies only in circumstances where a person knows or suspects that the Attorney General
or any police officer is acting or proposing to act in connection with an investigation that
is being or is about to be conducted into money laundering.119 Statutory exemption from
the anti-tipping off offences is provided for in circumstances where the disclosure is made
in circumstances where the communication would be protected by legal professional privilege.120 An exemption also exists where the disclosure is made by a person who is the client
of an accountant to that accountant for the purpose of enabling him or her to provide any
of a list of proscribed services.121 There are also a handful of relevant exemptions for certain
internal disclosures and to connected bodies.122
Trustees who find themselves in possession of trust assets and become aware or have a
suspicion that the assets are the proceeds of crime or property involved in terrorism come
under a statutory obligation to make an authorised disclosure under Article 34D. Provided
the trustee makes an authorised disclosure as soon as they become aware or suspicious
that they are holding the proceeds of crime, the trustee will not be at risk of prosecution.
Having made a disclosure, the trustee is prohibited by the anti-tipping off provisions from
making any disclosure to the beneficiaries, settlor (or any other person for that matter)
about their suspicion or their disclosure and is generally prohibited from doing anything
else that would prejudice any investigation. The trustee is also prohibited from making any
distributions from the trust fund to the beneficiaries or to make investments with the trust
fund without the consent of the JFCU. To do so would be to contravene the prohibitions
on transferring criminal property in Article 31(1)(c) and/or entering into or becoming

V. Confiscation Orders and Saisie Judiciaire
14-41

The regime in Part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 is directed to deprive
criminals of the benefit of their criminal conduct. Part 2 of the 1999 Law empowers HM
Attorney General to seek, or the Royal Court of its own motion to make, an order that the
defendant pay an amount assessed by the Court to be the value of the defendant's benefit
from the relevant criminal conduct. This is known as a confiscation order. A confiscation
order is not an order directed at the specific proceeds of criminal conduct but for confiscation of a sum of money equal to the proceeds of such conduct.123 A confiscation order
is a monetary order and not a proprietary order, made against any person convicted of a
criminal offence in Schedule 1. The scope of a confiscation order can be made against any
of the defendant's assets, whatever their origin. The standard of proof required in making
a confiscation order is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.124 Jersey does not
have any equivalent jurisdiction to that that exists in the UK to make a confiscation order
against a person on the basis of them having benefited from a criminal lifestyle.125 Property
is vulnerable to being subject to a confiscation order where the defendant is convicted of
an offence listed in Schedule 1 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 within a period
of six years prior to the confiscation order being made and the Court determines that the
defendant has benefited from criminal conduct. In determining whether the defendant has
benefited from criminal conduct, the Court is entitled to adopt certain rebuttable presumptions.126 Those presumptions are, first, that any property appearing to the Court to be held
by the defendant at any time since the date of the defendant's conviction, or appearing to
the Court to have been transferred to the defendant at any time since the beginning of
the relevant period was (1) received by the defendant at the earliest time when he or she
appears to the Court to have held it, and (2) was received by the defendant as a result of
or in connection with the commission of offences specified in Schedule 1.127 The second
presumption is that any of the defendant's expenditure since the beginning of the relevant
period was met out of payments received by the defendant as a result of or in connection
with the commission of offences specified in Schedule 1128 and the third presumption is
that, for the purposes of valuing any property that the defendant had or is assumed to have
had at any time, the defendant received the property free of any other interests in it.129

Confiscation Orders and Saisie Judiciaire

551

Perhaps of greater significance than Jersey's domestic regime for the making of confiscation
orders from the perspective of the litigation of trust disputes is the jurisdiction of the Royal
Court to give effect to a confiscation order made overseas against property representing the
benefit of criminal conduct located in Jersey, such as property settled into trust.130 The 2008
Regulations contain a list of prescribed matters of which the Royal Court has to be satisfied
of (and how they may be proven) before it will make a confiscation order in support of a
foreign order.
In support of a domestic131 or external confiscation order,132 the Court has power to
make an order, known as a saisie judiciaire. A saisie judiciaire has the effect of freezing133 a
person's134 realisable property situated in Jersey (whether movable or immovable) by vesting it in the Viscount on the application of the Attorney General.135 The purpose of a saisie
(literally 'seizure') is to 'hold the ring' and prevent the dissipation of assets pending the
determination of proceedings in which a confiscation order may be made.136 A saisie is the
Jersey equivalent of a restraint order under the UK's Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. However,
unlike a restraint order or a freezing injunction obtained under the Court's Mareva jurisdiction, a saisie operates in rem rather than in personam and has the effect of transferring
property in an asset subject to the saisie to the Viscount.
The statutory regime applying to external confiscation orders is a replica, with specific
amendments, of the regime that applies to domestic confiscation orders set out in Part 2 of
the 1999 Law, but in the form of regulations.137 In respect of a saisie granted in support of
external confiscation orders pursuant to the 2008 Regulations, we refer to the provisions of
the '1999 Law, as modified'. In respect of a saisie granted in support of domestic confiscation orders, pursuant to the main legislation, we refer to the '1999 Law'. Practitioners need
to be clear as to whether they are dealing with a domestic or external confiscation order
before resorting to either the Law or the Regulations to avoid mixing the provisions of the
two pieces of legislation together. While they are largely similar, they contain important
differences.
For the vast majority of practitioners dealing with trust litigation, their first encounter with
a saisie judiciare is likely to be when a party affected by it, such as a trustee or settlor/beneficiary, is served with the order. This is because only the Attorney General has locus to seek

Art 1(1) as an order made by a court in a country or territory outside Jersey: (1) for the purpose of recovering

for the purpose of recovering the value of the property so obtained; or (3) for the purpose of depriving a person
of a pecuniary advantage so obtained.

been instituted for an offence specified in Sch 1 to the 1999 Law (whether or not he or she has been convicted). In
the case of an external confiscation order, confined to mean (1) a person against whom an external confiscation
order has been made; or (2) a person against whom proceedings have been or are to be instituted in a court in a
country or territory outside Jersey that may result in an external confiscation order being made.

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

a saisie, which are proceedings brought under public law powers, not within the everyday
ambit of civil proceedings,138 and such orders are usually sought on an ex parte basis so
there is little that can be done to resist them in advance of the order being made. While
granted ex parte, the standard terms of the order require it to be brought to the attention
of the person affected by the order. As a matter of practical reality the important issues are
likely to be what trust property can properly be made subject to a saisie, the consequences of
such an order for the future administration of the trust and the rights of beneficiaries and
whether there are any grounds to seek to have the order varied or discharged.

A. Realisable Property
14-46

Whether in support of a domestic or an external confiscation order, a saisie judiciaire may
only be granted in respect of 'realisable property'. 'Realisable property' for the purposes of a
domestic confiscation order is defined139 as being (1) any property held by the defendant;
(2) any property held by a person to whom the defendant has directly or indirectly made a
gift falling within Article 2(9) of the Law;140 and (3) any property to which the defendant is
beneficially entitled. 'Realisable property' for the purposes of an external confiscation order
is defined in Article 2(1) of the 1999 Law as modified as including (1)-(3) above and also in
relation to an external confiscation order in respect of specified property, the property that
is specified in the order. It has been acknowledged that, if an external confiscation order
has been made and if property in Jersey is specified in that external confiscation order, it
might be argued that such property could be made the subject of a saisie even if it is not
realisable property falling within the three categories set out in Article (2)(1)(b) of the 1999
Law. In Tantular v HM Attorney General,141 it was posited by the Court, in a postscript to
its judgment, that on any application to register an external confiscation order in Jersey,
the Court would have to bear in mind Article 39(1)(c)142 and that an external confiscation
order which applied to property in Jersey which did not fall within Article 2(1)(b), would
'clearly' give rise to a strong argument that to confiscate such property would be contrary
to the interests of justice.143 Trust assets whose situs is outside Jersey are deemed situated in
Jersey (and thereby are realisable property) if they are held by a Jersey registered company,

138

Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 16(1).
ibid, Art 2(1).
140 Meaning, in the case of a domestic confiscation order (1) a gift made by the defendant at any time after the
commission of the offence or, if more than one, the earliest of the offences to which the proceedings for the time
being relate; and (2) a gift that the Court otherwise considers is appropriate in all the circumstances to take the
gift into account and in the case of an external confiscation order meaning, (1) a gift made by the defendant at any
time after the conduct to which the external confiscation order relates; and (2) the Court considers it appropriate
in all the circumstances to take the gift into account.
141 Tantular v AG (n 136).
142 Which provides that the Court may register an external confiscation order if it is of the opinion that enforcing the order in Jersey would not be contrary to the interests of justice.
143 To date, this proposition has not been tested and it remains to be established whether it is in fact sound. It
is the authors' view that the 2008 Regulations were not intended to establish a parallel system applying to external
confiscation orders that was different from the existing framework of the 1999 Law. While, prima facie the fact that
Art 2(1)(a) and Art 2(1)(b) are separate provisions would suggest they are to be read disjunctively which, if correct, would have the effect of overturning the outcome of the earlier Tantular decision discussed below, the more
likely explanation for the separate provision is as a result of untidy drafting.

the shares of which are subject to a saisie.144 While only property in Jersey situs property
vests in the Viscount automatically on the making of a saisie, the Viscount has power to
require the repatriation to Jersey of overseas property.145

B. Basis upon which a saisie judiciaire May Be Granted
In the support of an external confiscation order, the Court may grant a saisie judiciaire in
two circumstances: first, where proceedings have been instituted against the defendant in
a country or territory outside Jersey and those proceedings have not been concluded, and
either an external confiscation order146 has been made in those proceedings, or it appears to
the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that such an order may be made
in the proceedings; or, secondly, where it appears to the Court that proceedings are to be
instituted against the defendant in a country or territory outside Jersey, and that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that an external confiscation order may be made in those
proceedings.147 The Royal Court must be satisfied that (1) there is a reasonable likelihood
that there either there is confiscation order or (2) there are reasonable grounds for believing
that an external confiscation order may be made. If the Court is not satisfied that this will
be the case, there is no likelihood that an application to register the external order will be
successful and the saisie judiciaire should therefore be discharged.148
The circumstances in which the court may make a saisie judiciaire in support of a domestic
confiscation order under the 1999 Law are more complex and include:149
1.

where the Court has already made a confiscation order;
where proceedings have already been instituted in Jersey against the defendant for an
offence specified in Schedule 1 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999. For this
purpose, the Court will apply Jersey law as that law exists at the time the application for
a saisie is made to the Royal Court;150

144

In re Kaplan [2009 JLR 88].
Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 16(4) and 1999 Law, Art 16(4) as modified. This power may be
of more theoretical than of practical significance because in order to exercise it the Viscount requires a specified
person within the jurisdiction of the Jersey Court who can be compelled to assist him or must seek the assistance
of overseas authorities in preserving or recovering property.
146 Defined in the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 1 as an order made by a court in a country or
territory outside Jersey: (1) for the purpose of recovering property obtained as a result of or in connection with
conduct corresponding to an offence specified in Schedule 1; (2) for the purpose of recovering the value of the
property so obtained; or (3) for the purpose of depriving a person of a pecuniary advantage so obtained.
147 Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 15.
148 Tantular v AG (n 136) at [19]. The Court must satisfy itself that it has reasonable grounds for believing an
external confiscation order may be made in foreign proceedings. Evidence of the belief of a person running those
proceedings is insufficient; see In re Kaplan (n 144) at [22]-[24]. This is a low threshold-in the Tantular decision
above, the fact that the order stated on its face that that the assets in question 'are seized for the state' was held
sufficient to satisfy the Court.

where the Court is satisfied that proceedings are to be instituted in Jersey against a person for an offence specified in Schedule 1, or that an application of a kind mentioned

where a criminal investigation has been started in Jersey in respect of alleged criminal
conduct; and the Court is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the
alleged offender has benefited from the criminal conduct.

C. Consequences and Duration of a saisie judiciaire
14-49

If a confiscation order is made (or in the case of an external confiscation order, the foreign
proceedings are concluded and an external confiscation order is made and registered in
Jersey), the Court may empower the Viscount to realise any realisable property which has
been vested in him in order to satisfy the confiscation order at which point the saisie is discharged.158 Theoretically, the Viscount has power to require repatriation of realisable overseas property;159 however, the Court has given a strong indication that this power should be
exercised only in exceptional circumstances, particularly in external confiscation cases.160
If no confiscation order is made the Royal Court may discharge the saisie judiciaire and the
151 Under which the Court may make a confiscation order against a defendant, if satisfied that the defendant
has died or absconded.
152 Under which the Court may make a confiscation order against a defendant for an offence under Sch 1 for
which at the time the defendant was originally sentenced, a confiscation order had not been made.
153 Under which the Court may make a confiscation order where an original determination that there had been
no benefit from any relevant criminal conduct is made unsound by further evidence.
154 Under which the Court may make a confiscation order pursuant to a revised assessment of the benefit from
any relevant criminal conduct.
155 Under which the AG may apply to the Court for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the
confiscation order where the amount that might be realised is greater than the amount of a person's benefit from
relevant criminal conduct taken into account in making the confiscation order
156 ie that the real value of the defendant's benefit from relevant criminal conduct is greater than its assessed
value (whether because the real value was higher at the time of the current determination than was thought or
because the value of the benefit in question has subsequently increased).
157 ie that the amount that might be realised in the case of the person in question is greater than the amount
taken into account in making the confiscation order (whether it was greater than was thought when the order was
made, or it has subsequently increased).
158 Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, Art 17.
159 In re Kaplan (n 144).
160 ibid, endorsing King v Serious Fraud Office [2009] UKHL 17 at [31]:

If a country wishes assistance from other countries in preserving or recovering property that is related to
criminal activity, it makes sense for its request to each of those other countries to be restricted to the provision of assistance in relation to property located within its own jurisdiction. If each country were requested
to take steps to procure the preservation or recovery of property on a worldwide basis, this would lead to
a confusing, and possibly conflicting, overlap of international requests for assistance. Not only would such
multiplication of activity be confusing, it would also involve significant and unnecessary multiplication of
effort and expense.

Confiscation Orders and Saisie Judiciaire

555

realisable property will be returned to the owner. The Court also has discretion to discharge
the saisie prior to a confiscation order coming into effect if to continue to maintain it results
in serious practical difficulties.161 The Royal Court may also vary the terms of a saisie judiciaire pending a final determination so as to authorise the Viscount to release assets that
would otherwise be frozen in his hands. While property subject to a saisie is vested in the
Viscount, the Viscount is under an obligation in accordance with the Court's directions,
to manage or otherwise deal with any such realisable property.162 However, the Viscount's
liability in respect of the property is limited in respect of any loss or damage resulting from
the Viscount's action, except in so far as the loss or damage is caused by the Viscount's
negligence.163

D. Trusts and saisies judiciaires
In Tantular v HM Attorney General,164 the Royal Court concluded that a beneficiary of a
discretionary trust is not 'beneficially entitled' for the purposes of Article 2(1)(b)(iii) of the
1999 Law (or as modified by the 2008 Regulations) to any of the assets of that trust and, as
such,165 the Court had no power to grant a saisie judiciaire over all the assets of a discretionary trust merely on the ground that the offender (or suspected offender) is a beneficiary of
such a trust.
All things being equal, there is no difference as a matter of law between the position of one
discretionary beneficiary and another. The fact that one may be the settlor does not make
his legal position different, nor does anything said in any letter of wishes. In Tantular, the
fact that the settlor referred to himself as the 'principal beneficiary' in the letter of wishes
did not alter the legal position. Even if in reality it may be more likely (as a result of the
letter of wishes) that the trustee would appoint assets to the settlor than to any of the other
discretionary objects that does mean that the settlor is entitled to those assets.166
The object of a discretionary power has no proprietary interest in the trust property. Article
1 of the 1999 Law defines 'property' very widely and includes all property, whether movable
or immovable, or vested or contingent, and whether situated in Jersey or elsewhere. To the
extent that a discretionary beneficiary's interest can be described as 'contingent property', it
is only that interest which can conceivably be so described, not the underlying property that
is subject to the trust. Thus all that could be made the subject of a saisie judiciaire would
be the discretionary beneficiary's interest under the trust, which is no more than his right
to be considered for appointment by the trustee, which is by itself worthless to be worth
confiscating. This, of course, is a completely different proposition from the suggestion that

the beneficiary is beneficially entitled to all or any part of the trust property.167 Where the
beneficiary's interest in the trust property is vested rather than contingent on the exercise
of a discretionary power, the Court in Tantular suggested, albeit obiter, without argument
and only by way of an example to demonstrate the fallacy in the Crown's primary case that
the whole fund of a discretionary trust should vest in the Viscount, that the saisie would
be limited in scope only to the beneficiary's fixed interest, whether vested in possession or
vested in interest.168 It should be noted that indefeasible fixed interests in either capital or
income are rare in modern trust drafting; most are subject to some overriding power of
appointment.
14-53

14-54

However, that is not to say that a saisie judiciaire can never be ordered against the assets of a
discretionary trust. It will often be the case that there is evidence that the offender (or suspected offender) has settled assets to the trust after the date upon which the alleged criminal
conduct began. Peculiar to the facts in Tantular was a challenge to the scope of the saisie
on the grounds that some of the assets were settled into trust before any alleged criminal
conduct began and, therefore, were not dispositions caught by Article 2(9) of the 1999 Law.
Where assets are contributed after the date upon which the alleged criminal conduct began
those trust assets would be realisable property under Article 2(1)(b)(ii) to the extent of any
such dispositions. It follows that it might well be appropriate to make an application for a
saisie judiciaire against a trust in support of an anticipated application for a confiscation
order where there is evidence of gifts to a trust after the date upon which the criminal conduct in question began. In deciding whether to grant the saisie at that stage the Court will
have regard to the policy objectives of the legislation in seeking to remove from offenders169
the benefit of criminal conduct but must at the same time have regard to the need for any
order to be proportionate. The Tantular decision also leaves the door ajar to the possibility
of a saisie judiciaire being made in respect of the entire extent of the trust fund where, for
example, all the trust property has been settled after the alleged criminal conduct began and
in circumstances where the settlor was the only discretionary object of the trust and there
would be no 'innocent' beneficiaries who would be prejudiced in the fund being frozen.
Ordering that trust property be subject to a saisie judiciaire engages Article 1 of the First
Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),170 incorporated in Jersey
Law by the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000, Article 4(1) of which requires local legislation
to be read down so as to provide that the court could only make an order which would be
compatible with the ECHR.171 Article 1 requires a balance to be struck and imports the
requirement that there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the
means employed by the state in, inter alia, the deprivation of property as a form of penalty,

See endorsement of a purposive approach to construction in Re Kaplan (n 144); and In re Illinois District
Court [2001 JLR 160].
170 Which provides: 'Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.
No-one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for
by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way
impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance
with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties'.

Confiscation Orders and Saisie Judiciaire

557

and the legitimate aim which is sought to be realised by the deprivation. A saisie granted
over the entirety of the trust assets merely on the ground that the suspected offender is a
discretionary beneficiary to the prejudice of innocent beneficiaries is liable to be subject to
challenge both on the aforementioned grounds and as a disproportionate exercise of state
power.

E. Discharge or Variation of a saisie
Any person affected by a saisie may make an application for its discharge or variation to
the Bailiff in chambers, who may rule upon the application or may refer it to the Court
for adjudication.172 An application to discharge or vary a saisie should be commenced by
way of Representation, convening, naturally, the Attorney General, the Viscount and any
other party, such as a trustee, that has been affected by the saisie or may be affected by its
discharge or variation. In seeking to discharge or vary a saisie, there is no burden of proof
on either the Attorney General to maintain the order or on the applicant to discharge it. The
Court will instead consider whether, having regard to the policy objectives of the Proceeds
of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, ie to deprive criminals of the proceeds of criminal conduct,
whether it is fair, reasonable and proportionate to maintain the order in force.173 It is also
to be noted that a saisie differs in one other significant respect from a Mareva or freezing injunction in that neither the Attorney General nor any foreign government on whose
behalf a saisie is being sought in support of an external confiscation order, can be required
to give any kind of cross-undertaking in damages with respect to any loss suffered as a consequence of applying for or seeking to maintain the saisie.174
The Kaplan case makes it clear that a saisie is to be considered only as a temporary measure
to prevent dissipation of assets pending either confiscation or some other mechanism to
secure the property from dissipation in the meantime, whichever comes sooner.175 While
the policy objectives that underpin the jurisdiction to grant a saisie is taken very seriously
by the Court, the Court will not insist that a saisie be maintained indefinitely176 or in circumstances so as to create practical difficulties for those otherwise innocent or a neutral
party adversely affected by how a saisie works. The Court's primary concern will be to
ensure that the continuation of a saisie does not put the Viscount in a position of practical
difficulty in administering the property vested in him. The purpose of the saisie is entirely
undermined if the property cannot be properly secured. This sort of situation may arise
in circumstances where although property is realisable and vested in him, the property is
overseas, illiquid (such as land), cannot be repatriated to Jersey or the Viscount is unable

to obtain the assistance of local authorities in the property's preservation or realisation.177
The Viscount is a public official whose costs and expenses in administering property
subject to the saisie are met from that property. Where it becomes practically difficult for
the Viscount's costs and expenses to continue to be met from the fund and the possibility
arises that recourse will instead have to be had to public funds, the Court will be sympathetic to relieve the Viscount from his duties and discharge the saisie.
After the Viscount, a close second for the Court's concern in permitting a saisie to continue
will be the position of a trustee. The transfer of property in the trust assets to the Viscount
has a number of significant consequences that place him in a difficult position: (1) the trustee's right of indemnity and remuneration from the fund becomes ineffective; (2) the trustee cannot deal with or administer the trust property; (3) the trustee is unable to fulfil any
of his fiduciary obligations to the beneficiaries; and (4) the trustee cannot resign or retire
because there must always be at least one trustee in office178 and to retire would require
transferring the trust property, no longer vested in the trustee, to new trustees.
When a saisie judiciaire is subsequently varied or discharged at the instance of the defendant, it will generally be appropriate for the defendant to be awarded his costs out of public
funds.179 However there are only very limited circumstances under which compensation
may be payable to a person who has suffered loss as a result of a saisie being granted.180

VI. Civil Recovery of Criminal Property
14-59

Jersey does not have a domestic legal framework equivalent to the regime in Part 5 of the
UK's Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 by which property that is or represents the proceeds of
unlawful conduct may be recovered by way of civil proceedings from the hands of any person holding it. However, Jersey does have a legislative regime permitting the enforcement
of civil recovery orders made in foreign jurisdictions against assets that are amenable to the
jurisdiction of the Royal Court, whether or not located in Jersey,181 including property held
by trustees.182 Only a limited number of jurisdictions have a civil forfeiture scheme and
asset sharing agreement with Jersey.183 As observed in a recent case, at its most basic, the
2007 Law provides a means whereby individuals in Jersey can be deprived of their property
following proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction that they may not have taken part in.184

It follows that the making of a civil recovery order outside Jersey can still have a significant
impact within the island on the way trust property is administered. Because the 2007 Law is
directed to assist the enforcement of foreign civil asset recovery orders, the Royal Court will
invariably require factual evidence of foreign law and procedure as to precisely what has
occurred in the foreign jurisdiction and the nature of those proceedings. The 2007 Law was
enacted having regard to the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
and in anticipation of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment of Jersey against
the standards set out in those recommendations. A number of international conventions
are relevant aids to the interpretation of legislation such as the 2007 Law.185
The 2007 Law contains a regime to compel the taking of evidence or the disclosure of documents from any person, including a trustee, in relation to property that is or may be the
subject of external civil recovery proceedings.186 Under Part 2 of the 2007 Law, a foreign
responsible authority187 may apply to HM Attorney General for assistance in obtaining evidence in Jersey either in connection with external civil asset recovery proceedings that have
been instituted in a country or territory, or an investigation for the purpose of external civil
asset recovery proceedings that are being, or may be, instituted in a country or territory;
where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the evidence is, or relates to, property
that is either tainted property188 or is intended to be used in, obtained in the course of, from
the proceeds of, or in connection with, unlawful conduct. HM Attorney General may issue
a notice to any person requiring (1) the production of any documents or other articles to
the Attorney General, the Viscount or the Royal Court; and/or (2) attendance before the
Royal Court or the Viscount to give evidence on the content of the documentation. HM
Attorney General must be satisfied that the assistance sought is in connection with either
external civil asset recovery proceedings which have been instituted or an investigation for
the purpose of such proceedings that are, or may be, instituted in the foreign country. Jersey
has stated its reluctance to act as 'the world's policeman' to give assistance under the 2007
legislation in relation to property situate outside Jersey.189
The Royal Court and Viscount have the same powers for securing the attendance of a person to whom a notice has been given or any other witness as it has for the purpose of
other civil proceedings before it.190 Nothing in the 2007 Law affects the jurisdiction that

exists under the Bankers' Books Evidence (Jersey) Law 1986 to order the production of
evidence under that legislation191 and the Bankers' Books Evidence (Jersey) Law 1986
applies to the giving to the Attorney General pursuant to a requirement to provide material under Article 3(2)(a) of the 2007 Law of any evidence to which the 1986 Law applies,
as if the giving of the evidence to the Attorney General took place in proceedings before a
court.192
A person served with a notice under Article 3(2) from the Attorney General shall not, upon
pain of criminal penalty, without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with it in relation to
evidence that the person may under Article 4 of the 2007 Law be compelled to give. No
one may be compelled to give evidence193 under the 2007 Law unless the evidence could be
compellable from them in civil proceedings in Jersey or in civil proceedings the jurisdiction from which the request for evidence originates.194 However, the evidence will not be
compellable if the claim of the person questioned to be exempt from giving the evidence,
is conceded by the responsible authority making the request in the civil proceedings from
which the request for evidence originates.195 If the claim made by a person questioned to
be exempt from giving the evidence is not conceded, the person may be required to give the
evidence to which the claim relates; but their evidence cannot be transmitted to the responsible authority which requested it if a court in the country or territory in question, on the
matter being referred to it, upholds the claim.196
The enforcement of an external civil asset recovery order in Jersey is usually comprised
of two stages. The first stage involves an application for a property restraint order over
specified property located within Jersey or otherwise amenable to the jurisdiction of the
Royal Court. The second stage involves the registration with the Royal Court of a civil asset
recovery order obtained abroad and its subsequent enforcement in Jersey against assets, at
least some of which will usually have been already been restrained. Under Part 3 of the 2007
Law, a foreign government may seek the Attorney General's assistance to apply on its behalf
to the Royal Court for a property restraint order197 and directions over the management
of or dealing with the identified property. An order may be granted if the Court is satisfied that certain specified requirements are met: namely there are reasonable grounds for
believing that a civil asset recovery order may be made by the relevant foreign court in civil
asset recovery proceedings already instituted or shortly to be instituted in that country.198
An external civil asset recovery order is defined as an order made by a foreign court, not in
criminal proceedings, and must specify either: (1) the property used, or intended to be used,
in unlawful conduct or obtained in the course of, from the proceeds of, or in connection
with unlawful conduct; or (2) the sum of money to be forfeit or recovered in lieu of tainted

property.199 The definition of 'tainted property' has two parts. Under the first part it means
property 'found' to have been 'used in, or intended to be used in, unlawful conduct'. In
broad terms, this first part is concerned with property which is not necessarily the proceeds
of crime but the instrumentalities of crime. The second part is concerned with property
'found' to have been 'obtained in the course of, from the proceeds of, or in connection with,
unlawful conduct'. This second part is concerned with the proceeds of crime. It must be
the case that the first part of the definition adds something to the second part. If property
'used in' unlawful conduct has itself to comprise the proceeds of crime, then the first part
of the definition becomes redundant. Thus in the first part of the definition, the property
'used in' unlawful conduct may comprise property from legitimate sources that is used in
unlawful conduct.200 The second part of the definition of 'tainted property'-the proceeds
of crime-in the 2007 Law, appears wider than the definition of 'criminal property' for a
domestic laundering offence.201 Neither of these definitions includes the words 'obtained
in the course of '. It is important to note, however, that the test does not require a tracing
exercise as would be required in a civil case.202 A judgment in default obtained outside of
Jersey is capable of being sufficient to obtain an external restraint order under Article 6 of
the 2007 Law.203 It should also be borne in mind that it is not necessary that the words used
in the 2007 Law be interpreted in the same way as those words might be interpreted as part
of a wholly domestic statute. The question is always what the words mean in the particular
statute in question, the Court being guided by the expert evidence of foreign law.204
The principal effects of a property restraint order are that the specified property vests
in the Viscount subject to all existing security interests, that the persons specified are
prohibited from dealing with the specified property205 and are required to deliver the property up to the Viscount;206 and that if concerned the property may be removed from the
jurisdiction, the police are authorised to seize it.207 Where the Royal Court has made a
property restraint order, the order may be discharged if external asset recovery proceedings
are not instituted within a reasonable time as stipulated by the Royal Court.208 Once made,
a property restraint order may be discharged or varied in respect of any property to which
the external civil asset recovery proceedings in respect of which the order was made may
relate and shall be discharged on satisfaction of an order made under Article 10 of the 2007
Law. An application to discharge or vary a property restraint order may be made to the

obtained outside of Jersey is capable of qualifying for registration as a finding that property

Trust Property and the Proceeds of Crime

Is it an order or other judicial authority made other than in the course of criminal
proceedings by a court or tribunal (or other body or person), who is authorised under
a law of another country or territory to make orders of the type in (2) below?
Does the order specify that property specified in the order has been found (by a relevant court or person) to have been either:
i.
used in, or intended to be used in, unlawful conduct; or
ii. obtained in the course of, from the proceeds of, or in connection with, unlawful
conduct; or specify an amount of money to be money forfeited or recovered in
lieu of property; or
iii. used in, or intended to be used in, unlawful conduct; or
iv. obtained in the course of, from the proceeds of, or in connection with, unlawful
conduct?
Is the order in force and not subject to appeal?
If the respondent did not appear in the foreign court, is the Court satisfied that he or
she received notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him or her to defend
them?
Is the Court of the opinion that enforcing the order in Jersey would not be contrary to
the interests of justice?

As with a judgment sought to be recognised or registered in Jersey pursuant to the principles discussed in Chapter 15, there are very few bases upon which the Royal Court may
seek to go behind the external confiscation order to establish whether the foreign court was
justified in reaching the conclusion it did.211
Unlike the regime applicable to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments,
in the light of Article 9(b) foreign judgments obtained in default can be registered and
enforced in Jersey under the 2007 Law. Not to recognise and enforce default judgments
would severely emasculate the scheme for the recognition and enforcement of such overseas orders. One would only have to ignore the overseas domestic proceedings and allow

the overseas domestic court to enter judgment by default to be able to easily avoid the
confiscation or forfeiture of Jersey assets. Indeed, it could lead to the anomalous position
whereby judgments based on stronger, uncontested cases would be more difficult to enforce
in practice than judgments based on weaker cases that were contested.
Once an external civil asset recovery order is registered, the Court may, on the application
of the Attorney General, order that so much of the property, specified in the order as is not
subject to a property restraint order, shall vest in the Viscount and may, in accordance with
the directions of the Court, be managed, dealt with or realised by the Viscount; and any
property specified in the order that is subject to a property restraint order may, in accordance with the directions of the Court, be managed, dealt with or realised by the Viscount.
However, the Royal Court may not exercise these powers until it has afforded persons holding any interest in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the
Court.212 Once the Court has directed for the vesting of property subject to the property
restraint order to vest in the Viscount, all the recoverable property that is specified in the
order shall vest in the Viscount, subject to all hypothecs and security interests with which
the property was burdened before it was so vested,213 and the Viscount shall, in accordance with the Court's directions, manage or otherwise deal with, any recoverable property
that is specified in the order.214 Proceedings to register and enforce an external civil asset
recovery order are civil proceedings and are solely concerned with the enforcement of the
pre-existing rights of a foreign government against Jersey assets.215
Funds obtained by the Viscount, including the realised proceeds of assets that become
vested in the Viscount or obtained under an asset sharing agreement216 are credited in a
designated fund, the 'Civil Asset Recovery Fund', managed by the States of Jersey. The Civil
Asset Recovery Fund may be used to discharge Jersey's obligations under any asset sharing
agreement with a foreign country or territory and a variety of expenses of the Viscount or
Attorney General, but those funds not applied or not required to be applied, to discharge
the obligation described in Article 11(6)(a), (b) or (d) of the 2007 Law, are credited into
Jersey's consolidated fund or held by the Treasurer of the States of Jersey at the close of each
financial year.217 It follows that funds taken by the Viscount under Articles 9 to 11 of the
2007 Law are washed clean of any subsisting beneficial interest.

The Recognition and Enforcement
of Judgments against Jersey Trust
Assets and Trustees
I. Introduction
As a leading international finance centre in which hundreds of billions of pounds of assets
are held in bank accounts and under administration in the island's fund and trust sectors,1
an understanding of the local regime that applies to the enforcement and execution of foreign judgments is of major practical importance when Jersey trusts and trust assets are the
subject of litigation.
Subject to one significant statutory exception relevant to enforcement against Jersey trusts,2
Jersey's customary law principles on the conflict of laws as they pertain to the enforcement
of foreign judgments are heavily influenced by English common law principles.3
A foreign judgment is any judgment that is not a judgment of the Petty Debts Court, the
Royal Court, the Jersey Court of Appeal or the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
(for appeals from Jersey).4 A foreign judgment has no direct operation in Jersey and cannot
be immediately enforced by way of execution without more. However a foreign judgment
may be recognised or enforced in Jersey either by way of suing on the foreign judgment at
customary law or by way of registration of the foreign judgment, under statute, followed by
execution as with any other Jersey judgment.

II. Recognition and Enforcement
There is a distinction between the recognition of a foreign judgment and its enforcement. While by necessary implication the Royal Court will recognise every foreign
judgment which it enforces, it need not enforce every foreign judgment which it recognises.

Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments

A judgment creditor in proceedings from another jurisdiction may come to Jersey seeking
to have that judgment executed or otherwise carried into effect as against the person against
whom it is given. This is a classic case of the judgment creditor seeking to have the foreign
judgment enforced in Jersey. Obviously not every type of judgment is capable of enforcement in this way; obviously a party to foreign proceedings against whom a claim has been
dismissed cannot seek to have that determination enforced. Equally the Royal Court has no
jurisdiction to enforce a determination as to the title to a foreign situs immovable.5
The Royal Court may also give practical effect to the judgment of a foreign court that does
not involve execution or enforcement in the sense described above by recognising a judgment as determinative of the issue between the parties. A person in whose favour a judgment is given may seek to resist an attempt by the party with whom they have been in
litigation from seeking to re-litigate the same issue in Jersey. Conversely a party against
whom judgment has been entered abroad may seek to use the judgment or the fact that it
has already been satisfied to resist a further claim by the party in whose favour judgment
was entered.

III. Enforcement and Recognition of Foreign Judgments
at Customary Law
15-6

15-7

Despite the heavy influence of English conflict of laws principles, not all the Jersey authorities speak with one voice or are consistent with the approach long taken in England as to the
proper jurisdictional basis for the enforcement and recognition of foreign judgments by the
Royal Court. For many years, the principle of comity appears to have been the basis upon
which the Royal Court would recognise and give effect to foreign judgments at customary
law.6
While some notion of comity lies behind the jurisdictional basis for the enforcement of
foreign judgments in Jersey, comity is far too broad and loose a principle so as to provide
the basis of a rule.7 Comity is a policy factor that underpins how rules have developed
over time rather than a rule in and of itself and as such cannot be applied so as to provide
any measure of certainty in the outcome of specific cases. To describe comity as a rule for

5 Although it may still be given effect to and enforced as a judgment in personam if it satisfies certain conditions,
at least where to do so is consistent with the substance of the judgment; see Pattni v Ali [2007] 2 AC 85, [2006]
UKPC 51.
6 Lane v Lane (née Coverdale) [1985-86 JLR 48]; Compass Trustees Ltd v McBarnett [2002 JLR 321]; In re Bald
Eagle Trust [2003 JLR N 16]; In re Fountain Trust [2005 JLR 359]; In re H Trust [2006 JLR 280]; In re B Trust [2006
JLR 562], but cf IMK Family Trust [2008 JLR 250]; Showlag v Mansour [1994 JLR 113], per Lord Keith of Kinkel.
7 'Comity, in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy
and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience,
and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws'; Hilton v Guyot
(1895) 159 US 113 at 163-64. Note too that the 1960 Law provides no discretionary basis by which the Royal Court
may refuse to register a foreign judgment falling within its scope.

Enforcement at Customary Law

567

the recognition of foreign judgments is analogous to describing the principle of freedom
of contract as a term of a contract, or the principle of testamentary freedom as a term of
a will.8 Many of the cases cited above that appear to approve the principle that comity is
the touchstone can be equally reconciled as being consistent with principle of obligation
(discussed below). The limits of the principle of comity as the jurisdictional basis by which
the Royal Court recognises and gives effect to foreign judgments is easily demonstrated
in that the Royal Court will not conduct an investigation as to what reciprocal rights of
enforcement are conceded by a foreign jurisdiction in respect of Jersey judgments, nor does
it limit the exercise of its own jurisdiction to that which is capable of being recognised
and given effect to abroad. It is also to be observed that the doctrine of comity affords the
enforcing court with a discretion whether or not to enforce or give effect to the judgment
of a foreign court whereas the later principles have tended to regard the enforcement of a
foreign judgment in personam as being mandatory rather than a matter of discretion.9
Comity, as the basis upon which judgments of foreign courts are to be recognised and given
effect to, as a matter of English law, was displaced by what has become known as the doctrine of obligation, which is expressed in the following way:10

15-8

We think that … the true principle on which the judgments of foreign tribunals are enforced in
England is … that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction over the defendant imposes a
duty or obligation on the defendant to pay the sum for which judgment is given, which the courts
in this country are bound to enforce; and consequently that anything which negatives that duty, or
forms a legal excuse for not performing it, is a defence to the action.11

Therefore, provided the foreign court had jurisdiction to give the judgment according to
the English (and by extension Jersey) rules of the conflict of laws, the judgment is conclusive and will be recognised and given effect to in England as a judgment in personam (unless
it is impeachable, eg by reason of fraud, the contravention of principles of public policy
or natural justice, or in Jersey, by reason of Article 9(4) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984).12
A judgment creditor seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in Jersey at customary
law must bring an action (usually by way of Order of Justice) on the foreign judgment.
However, the judgment creditor is not obliged to conduct a full trial of the original action
again and can apply for summary judgment pursuant to Part 7 of the RCR 2004, on the
ground that the defendant has no arguable defence to the claim;13 and if a summary
judgment application succeeds, the defendant will not be given leave to defend. A litigant
seeking recognition of a foreign judgment, for the purposes described above,14 would

not otherwise impeachable, may be recognised and enforced by a claim or counterclaim in
Jersey for the amount due.15 Consistent with long-established authority, the Royal Court
will not entertain an action or the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a claim for
a debt or definite sum of money in the nature of a fine or like penalty16 or a fiscal liability
of a foreign state.17 An action by a foreign state to recover stolen property or to enforce
contractual rights is justiciable in Jersey as the enforcement of in personam rights and does
not fall within the usual preclusionary rule that a Jersey court will not enforce public law
of a foreign state.18

B. A Judgment Given in personam
15-12

An judgment given in personam is a judgment in respect of a claim brought against a person
to compel him to do a particular thing, eg the payment of a debt or damages for a breach of
contract or for tort, or the specific performance of a contract; or to compel him not to do
something, eg when an injunction is sought. A claim against a person in equity is a claim
in personam, even where superficially the proceedings concern the beneficial entitlement
to property, eg a claim asserting that the defendant is a constructive trustee of assets held
beneficially by the plaintiff.19 A claim in personam may also be described as any claim which
is not a claim in in rem, a probate claim, or an administration claim.20 A claim in personam
does not include a proceeding for divorce or judicial separation,21 or for a declaration of
nullity of marriage or of legitimacy or proceedings in bankruptcy (which concern status
and are therefore claims in rem).

thing is decreed in satisfaction of a claim against the thing itself. The term is used also to describe (3) an adjudication as to status such as a decree of nullity or dissolution of marriage, and (4) a judgment ordering property to be
sold by way of administration in bankruptcy or death.

C. A Judgment for a Debt or Definite Sum of Money
Consistent with authority from Canada,22 the Cayman Islands23 and the Isle of Man,24
Jersey's Royal Court also has a discretion (consistent with that exercised in the earlier Jersey
decision of Lane v Lane)25 to recognise and enforce a non-money judgment given in personam at customary law. That discretion is not confined to the Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. However, it is a discretion that is to be
exercised cautiously26 and cannot be exercised where to do so would be inconsistent with
Article 9 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. The flexibility to enforce non-money judgments
that was recognised to exist in Brunei does not alter the requirement that the party against
whom the judgment is sought to be enforced in Jersey must have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court whose order is sought to be enforced.27

15-13

i. Judgment Must be Final and Conclusive
No foreign judgment may be enforced at customary law unless it is final and conclusive.
The test of finality is whether the judgment by the foreign court would be treated by it as
chose jugée (a Jersey customary law concept similar to the principle of res judicata) but a
judgment which was liable to be abrogated or varied by the court which meant it was not a
final judgment. The possibility of an appeal in the foreign court to a higher court does not
alter the finality of the foreign judgment. Where the Royal Court is presented with conflicting final judgments by foreign courts of competent jurisdiction the Royal Court will give
effect to the earliest in time unless it would be unfair to do so, eg if the judgment creditor seeking to enforce the foreign judgment was estopped by representation from relying upon it.28
The judgment of a foreign court remains final and conclusive and therefore capable of
recognition and enforcement at customary law notwithstanding that the decision of the
foreign court is appealed against in breach of undertakings given to the Jersey Royal Court
not to do so.29
Where difficulties arise in determining whether a foreign order providing for periodical
payments (eg for maintenance) is final and conclusive, the applicable principles appear
to be that such orders are final and conclusive if they incapable of alteration by the court
that made them but if they are capable of variation by the court which made them (such as
orders of periodical payments made by the Family Division of the High Court) no action
is maintainable on them at customary law; however, a statutory mechanism exists for the
registration and enforcement in Jersey of maintenance orders made in any Commonwealth

country if the payer is resident in Jersey.30 However, an order that is variable in respect of
future payments may not be variable in so far as arrears are concerned in which case an
action may be brought for the recovery of the arrears.
A judgment may be final and conclusive notwithstanding an appeal is actually pending
in the foreign jurisdiction. The test for finality is whether it is final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it.31 If the judgment of the foreign court is appealed, the Royal
Court may take steps to protect the interests of the appealing party while still proceeding to
recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment (eg by granting a stay of execution in
Jersey pending the outcome of the appeal). The effect of registration of a foreign judgment
that is subsequently successfully appealed pending enforcement in Jersey is that the Jersey
action to enforce melts away as there is no judgment capable of enforcement or registration
under the 1960 Law.32 That proposition is subject to the Royal Court being prepared to
recognise the judgment of the appellate court.33

ii. Whether the Foreign Court Is to Be Treated as Having Jurisdiction
15-17

15-18

A judgment of a foreign court is impeachable if the foreign court did not have jurisdiction
to give the judgment.34 In the leading English Court of Appeal decision of Adams v Cape
Industries plc,35 it was said that in the absence of submission to the jurisdiction of the foreign court, the competence of a foreign court to summon the defendant before it depended
on the physical presence of the defendant in the country concerned at the time of suit.36
Whether the Royal Court regards the foreign court as having jurisdiction is to be decided in
accordance with Jersey law and not the law of the foreign court.37
The four principal bases upon which the foreign court will be judged in Jersey to have had
jurisdiction are:
1.

If the person against whom the judgment was given was, at the time the proceedings
were instituted, present in the foreign jurisdiction.
If the person against whom the judgment was given was claimant, or counterclaimed,
in the proceedings in the foreign court.

rough with the smooth, by accepting his amenability to the process of its courts. In the absence of authority

to give the courts of that country territorial jurisdiction over him under our rules of private international law.

If the person against whom the judgment was given, submitted to the jurisdiction of
that court by voluntarily appearing in the proceedings.
If the person against whom the judgment was given, had before the commencement of
the proceedings agreed, in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, to submit
to the jurisdiction of that court or of the courts of that country.38

a. Presence in the Foreign Jurisdiction at the Time the Foreign Proceedings
Are Commenced
Individuals
In Jersey law, an individual defendant's mere presence, as distinct from their residence, is
a sufficient basis to found jurisdiction. This is to be contrasted with the 1960 Law which
adopts residence, a concept that has inherently more permanence to it, as opposed to the
defendant's mere presence as the basis of jurisdiction over individuals.39

15-19

Corporations
A corporation is neither resident nor present in the sense those terms apply to an individual. In Jersey law a company resides either where the company is incorporated, the location of its registered office or the fixed place from which it carries on its business for more
than a minimal time (its principal office) regardless of the location of its directors or bank
accounts.40 The long line of English cases dealing with the question of whether a foreign
corporation does or does not carry on business in England so as to render itself amenable to
the jurisdiction of the English courts at common law are likely to be persuasive in Jersey.41 A
corporation can also be regarded as present within the jurisdiction of the courts of a foreign
country if its representative has, for more than a minimal period of time, been carrying
on the corporation's business in that country at or from some fixed place of business.42
A company may be deemed resident in a foreign jurisdiction through its subsidiary if the

of his staff; (c) what other contribution, if any, the overseas corporation made to the financing of the business
carried on by the representative; (d) whether the representative was remunerated by reference to transactions, eg
by commission, or by fixed regular payments or in some other way; (e) what degree of control the corporation
exercised over the running of the business conducted by the representative; (f) whether the representative reserved
part of his accommodation or part of his staff for conducting business related to the corporation; (g) whether the
representative displayed the corporation's name at his premises or on his stationery, and if so, whether he did so
in such a way as to indicate that he was a representative of the corporation; (h) what business, if any, the representative transacted as principal exclusively on his own behalf; (i) whether the representative made contracts with
customers or other third parties in the name of the corporation, or otherwise in such manner as to bind it; (j) if
so, whether the representative required specific authority in advance before binding the corporation to contractual
obligations.

subsidiary was as acting the parent company's agent. It may also treat the subsidiary as the
alter ego of the parent if special circumstances exist which indicate that there is a 'mere
facade concealing the true facts'.43 If the agent or subsidiary has authority to enter into
contracts on behalf of the corporation without seeking the prior approval of the parent or
principal, that will be a powerful indicator that the corporation is present.44
The 1960 Law requires that the corporation must either reside or have its principal place of
business (and not merely be carrying on business) in the foreign country.45 In the authors'
view the statutory rule and the customary law rule are consistent: the test of jurisdiction as
against a body corporate is satisfied if the corporation is carrying on business at a definite
and fixed place with a degree of permanence about it within the jurisdiction of the foreign
court.46 Neither at customary law nor under the statute is the presence of a corporation
comparable to what may be the fleeting presence of an individual in the jurisdiction.
b. Entering an Appearance in Proceedings

15-22

A person that applies to a foreign court in the position of a plaintiff47 will be deemed to have
bound himself to submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. A litigant who voluntarily submits himself to the jurisdiction of a court by appearing before it cannot afterwards
dispute its jurisdiction. Where a defendant appears and pleads to the merits without contesting the jurisdiction there is clearly a voluntary submission. In the context of submission
to the jurisdiction of an English court, the House of Lords has held that taking a step in
proceedings will only amount to a submission where the defendant takes a step which is
only necessary or useful if his objection to the jurisdiction is waived.48 Entering a voluntary
appearance renders a litigant subject to the jurisdiction of the foreign court both to the
original claim but also to such further claims as the court allows to be added by the plaintiff
that concern the same subject matter, and to related claims which ought to be dealt with in
the same proceedings. This will not extend to a defendant being deemed to subject himself
to claims by new plaintiffs.49
c. Challenges to Jurisdiction of the Foreign Court

15-23

Where the defendant to foreign proceedings contests the jurisdiction of the court, the position is regulated by Royal Court Rule 6/7(9). A party who makes a challenge to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is not deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction in making its
challenge. A successful challenge to the jurisdiction of the foreign court will mean that no
question of submission arises. A litigant who unsuccessfully challenges the jurisdiction of
the court but goes on anyway to contest the merits of the action is deemed to have submitted. But what of a litigant who, having challenged the jurisdiction of the court, takes no
further part in the foreign proceedings? There is no Jersey equivalent to section 33 of the
Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, which provides that a judgment debtor shall

not be regarded as having submitted to the foreign court by reason only of the fact that he

to contest the jurisdiction of the court;
to ask the court to dismiss or stay the proceedings on the ground that the dispute in
question should be submitted to arbitration or to the determination of the courts of
another country; or
to protect, or obtain the release of, property seized or threatened with seizure in the
proceedings.50

Prior to the enactment of the 1982 Act the English Court of Appeal in Harris
v Taylor51 decided under English common law, that a defendant who entered a conditional
appearance in the Isle of Man court in order to set aside the proceedings on jurisdictional
grounds was held to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Manx Court, even though he
took no further part in the proceedings after his application to set aside was unsuccessful.
This decision was followed in Henry v Geoprosco International,52 where the English Court
of Appeal held that there was a voluntary appearance where the defendant appeared before
the foreign court to invite that court in its discretion not to exercise a jurisdiction which
it had under its local law; and that there was also a voluntary appearance if the defendant
merely protested against the jurisdiction of the foreign court if the protest took the form of
a conditional appearance which was converted automatically by operation of law into an
unconditional appearance if the decision on jurisdiction went against the defendant. The
Court left open the question whether an appearance the sole purpose and effect of which
was to protest against the jurisdiction of the foreign court would be a voluntary appearance.
The status of the Taylor and Geoprosco decisions in Jersey has been expressly left open by the
Jersey Court of Appeal.53 It is also to be noted that the rule in RCR 6/7(9) is that a party who
makes a challenge to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is not deemed to have submitted
to the jurisdiction in making its challenge unless the Court shall otherwise order (emphasis
added), leaving open the possibility that the Royal Court may regard an unsuccessful jurisdiction challenge in the foreign court to amount to a voluntary appearance.

15-24

d. Agreement to Submit to the Jurisdiction
The final basis upon which the Royal Court will deem a party to have submitted to the
jurisdiction of a foreign court is where a contract that provides that all disputes between the
parties to it shall be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction54 of a foreign court or tribunal.55
The same is true for a jurisdiction clause that is non-exclusive.

50 Note that the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960, Art 6(2)(a) provides for something
similar to s 33 of the 1982 Act in that a submission for the purpose of protecting, or obtaining the release of, property seized, or threatened with seizure, in the proceedings, or of contesting the jurisdiction of the foreign court
does not amount to a submission for the purposes of registration of a judgment under that legislation.

A contractual submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of a foreign court is not to be regarded,
in and of itself, as a submission for all purposes to all the courts of the foreign jurisdiction.
Whether a particular contractual provision is a jurisdiction clause and the scope of such
provision is one of construction.56 A jurisdiction clause in a trust instrument is not to be
treated as being analogous to a jurisdiction clause in a contract for the purposes of determining whether a party to a trust dispute conducted before a foreign court has submitted
to the proceedings.57 An agreement to submit is not necessarily required to be in the form
of a contractual jurisdiction clause but may take the form of an agreement to accept service
of process at a particular address.

15-27

An agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court must be express and cannot be
implied.58 The agreement between parties that a contract or trust instrument is governed
by the proper law of a particular country does not mean the parties are in agreement to
submit to the jurisdiction of the courts to which that law applies. Nor can an agreement be
implied from the fact that the particular cause of action arose in the foreign jurisdiction or
that the defendant was physically present when the cause of action arose.59 While an agreement to submit cannot be implied, it is arguable that an alleged consent which was not contractually enforceable could be treated as a representation by the defendant of a willingness
to submit to the jurisdiction (which he could be estopped from denying) if acted upon by
the plaintiff provided that the representation was intended to be acted upon, or at least was
one which the plaintiff reasonably believed was intended to be acted upon.60

D. Reliance on Foreign in personam Judgments for Purposes other than
Enforcement
15-28

A litigant may seek to rely upon a foreign judgment in Jersey other than for the purposes
of enforcing it. A plaintiff who has brought proceedings abroad and lost may seek to bring
a similar claim in Jersey; or in proceedings on a different claim may raise an issue which
has been already decided abroad. A foreign judgment may be recognised without being
enforced, by refusing to allow the party against whom it has been given to re-open the
question decided. In such cases a foreign judgment entitled to recognition may give rise to
what in Jersey is known as a chose jugée (a Jersey species of estoppel) which has the effect
of preventing a party to proceedings from asserting or denying, as against the other party,
the existence of a cause of action,61 the non-existence or existence of which has been determined by the foreign court, or to an issue estoppel, which will prevent a matter of fact or
law necessarily decided by a foreign court from being re-litigated in Jersey).62

There are recognised to be four interrelated heads of estoppel under the banner of chose
jugée:63
1.

2.

3.

4.

15-29

A cause of action estoppel par chose jugée which will arise where the cause of action is
identical to a cause of action determined in the foreign proceedings between the same
parties and in relation to the same subject matter.
An issue estoppel par chose jugée which will arise where an identical issue between the
same parties or their privies64 has been decided by a judgment in a foreign court, being
a court of competent jurisdiction, on the merits65 finally and conclusively.66
A Henderson-style67 estoppel par chose jugée which will arise where a party to Jersey
proceedings raises a matter which could and should have been litigated in the foreign
proceedings.
A collateral attack which will arise where a party seeks to challenge the correctness of a
decision of a court other than by way of an appeal.68

A foreign judgment which is final and conclusive on its merits in favour of the defendant is
at customary law a good defence to a claim in Jersey for the same matter.69 There is no chose
jugée against a different remedy,70 although there may be an issue estoppel if a relevant issue
has been decided directly in the foreign action. Where two conflicting foreign judgments,
each of which would satisfy the criteria for recognition, have determined issues which arise
in the English proceedings, the general rule is that the one given first in time is to be recognised, to the exclusion of the latter.71
Special caution is required before a foreign judgment can be held to give rise to an issue
estoppel on the basis that the Royal Court may be unfamiliar with the civil procedure of a
foreign jurisdiction. Without that understanding it may be difficult to see whether a foreign
court has decided a particular issue or whether it was merely obiter. The Court must be
alive to the risk of injustice for a litigant to be barred from putting forward his case in Jersey
because he failed to do so in an earlier case abroad.72
The question of who is estopped by the decision of a foreign court may be more complex
than the 'same parties (or their privies)' formula suggests. For example, if a foreign court
has decided an issue against one, but not both, of the parties to an action, it may be an abuse
of process for the other to seek to litigate the point already decided against his co-party.73
Likewise, the question whether a person was a party and on that basis may be estopped in

Jersey requires careful examination. A person may be 'represented' before a foreign court in
the sense that the foreign court may have ordered them to be convened to the proceedings
or deems them to be bound according to local procedure even though they have not given
any expression of assent. Chose jugée will only arise against such a party if the foreign court
is regarded by the Jersey court as one of competent jurisdiction so far as the individual
person is concerned.
The judgment must be on the merits. A decision on the merits is a decision which establishes certain facts as proved or not in dispute; states what are the relevant principles of
law applicable to such facts; and expresses a conclusion with regard to the effect of applying those principles to the factual situation concerned.74 In Republic of Brazil v Durant,75
the Jersey Court of Appeal accepted in principle that issue estoppel could arise from an
interlocutory judgment, including a case management decision on a procedural, non-­
substantive issue where there was express submission of the issue in question to the foreign
court. In England, the effect of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 198476 is that a foreign
judgment determining any matter by reference to limitation is deemed to be on the merits
and subject to the lex causae. However, Jersey law contains no equivalent provision to the
1984 Act and under its own conflict of laws rules, limitation is at customary law, a matter
of procedure and thus governed by the lex fori.77 Jersey law therefore appears to adopt the
position prevailing in English law prior to the enactment of the 1984 Act, namely that a
judgment given in favour of a defendant in the foreign court on the ground that the action
is barred by limitation is not a decision on the merits.78

E. Procedure to Enforce a Foreign Judgment at Customary Law
15-34

Proceedings to enforce a foreign judgment at customary law are often (although not invariably) commenced by Order of Justice.79 Where the defendant to the enforcement action
is in Jersey, the proceedings on the foreign judgment are to be served on him personally
through the Viscount in the usual fashion for actions commenced by Order of Justice.
Where the defendant is outside the jurisdiction, the plaintiff will have to make an application to serve Order of Justice out of the jurisdiction.80 Where the Jersey proceedings on
the foreign judgment have been served on the defendant and the defendant has indicated
a desire to defend and the proceedings are placed on the pending list, the plaintiff may
apply for summary judgment even before the defendant has filed an Answer.81 Where the
defendant does not appear to defend or enter an Answer the judgment creditor plaintiff
may enter judgment against him. Unless the defendant satisfies the Court that there is an

issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried-for instance, on the ground that the
judgment was obtained by fraud-the Court may give judgment for the plaintiff.82 Issues of
chose jugée will often fall to be determined at an early stage in the proceedings, commonly
by way of a summons to strike out the proceedings under RCR 6/13(1)(d).

F. Defences to Proceedings Seeking the Recognition or Enforcement
of a Foreign Judgment at Customary Law
As in England, a foreign judgment cannot be re-examined on its merits or impeached for
an error of either fact or of law provided the foreign court had jurisdiction according to
the Jersey rules on the conflict of laws.83 This principle holds good whether the judgment
is relied upon by a plaintiff or a defendant, whether the judgment is in personam or in rem
(and so, in the latter instance, being unimpeachable against the whole world). The sole
exception to this principle appears to be where the foreign judgment falls within the scope
of Article 9(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. The implication of Article 9 is that the Royal
Court is entitled to conduct a review as to the substance of a foreign court's decision before
deciding whether it will give effect to it in Jersey which runs wholly contrary to the tenor
of the principles discussed so far in relation to the enforcement and recognition of foreign
judgments at customary law.
'Judgment' in this context is not thought to extend to a decision of a foreign court that the
judgment of a court of a third foreign country is entitled to be enforced under the law of
the foreign country, even where the proceedings in the foreign court were contested by parties who submitted to its jurisdiction in relation to this issue.84 However, an issue estoppel
par chose jugée may arise in an appropriate case, from rulings made by the third country
foreign court.85
A foreign judgment may be impeachable for fraud and on that basis may be refused recognition or effect in Jersey.
A foreign judgment may likewise be impeachable on the ground that its enforcement
or recognition in Jersey would be contrary to public policy or on the ground that the
proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were an affront to natural justice.

the jurisdiction of the foreign court.86 However, the Royal Court will not usually recognise a foreign court as having jurisdiction (and will therefore neither enforce nor recognise
a judgment) that purports to adjudicate upon the title to or right to possession of any
immovable property situated outside the jurisdiction of the foreign court. The jurisdiction of the courts of the situs of movables to give a judgment in rem is not exclusive to that
jurisdiction.87
A judgment in rem is a judgment which determines the right to possession of property or
property in a thing to a person. A judgment in rem is also used to describe a determination
as to status of a person (such as decree of dissolution of a marriage). A judgment in rem
is said to operate as against the whole world.88 A foreign judgment to the effect that the
beneficial interest in property held subject to a Jersey trust is actually held beneficially on
a constructive trust for another person, although superficially appearing to be an action
in rem, is in fact an action based in equity and therefore is a claim in personam.
A foreign judgment must purport to operate in rem for it to be recognised in Jersey as a
judgment in rem. If the foreign judgment is capable of being construed as a judgment in
rem but in which quality it would not qualify for recognition in Jersey, yet the judgment
also contains orders which require a person to pay money or otherwise perform acts, it may
be recognised or enforced in Jersey to that extent as a judgment which binds the parties in
personam if it otherwise satisfies the requirements above.89
Foreign judgments in rem rarely call to be enforced in Jersey (although are freely recognised) on the basis that a foreign judgment in rem determines title to or possession of property that is within the jurisdiction of the foreign court, and so no question of enforcement
in Jersey arises, or the property is outside the foreign court's jurisdiction, in which case the
Royal Court will not recognise the jurisdiction of the foreign court to have made the order
in the first place. A person may sue in Jersey to defend against the interference with his
rights to property pursuant to a foreign judgment in rem, but is recognised as doing so not
pursuant to the foreign judgment qua judgment but on the basis of the foreign judgment
qua assignment.
The Royal Court has held that a declaratory judgment is capable of enforcement at customary law provided that it is clear to the Royal Court that the foreign court was competent to
make the declaration; the same parties had submitted to the jurisdiction and the decision
had not been appealed and the judgment debtor had every opportunity to raise all relevant
defences at the hearing of the original action. A judgment debtor will be deemed to have
had such opportunity even if he chooses to absent himself from the proceedings.90 There
may be ancillary orders to a declaratory judgment, which because they order the payment
of money, (eg in a divorce or orders of the payment of costs) are themselves capable of
enforcement as a judgment in personam.91

IV. The Enforcement and Recognition of Foreign
Judgments under Statute
The registration of foreign judgments in Jersey is governed by the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960 (as amended) by the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Act 1973. The 1960 Law is also supplemented by the Judgments (Reciprocal
Enforcement) (Jersey) Rules 1961. The 1960 Law is based upon the UK's Foreign Judgments
(Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. The basis of the application of the 1960 Law in regard
to any territory within its scope is the existence of a substantial measure of reciprocity with
those jurisdictions.92 Jersey is not a party to the prevailing statutory regime in force in the
UK giving effect to the Brussels I Regulation93 or the Lugano Convention. Enforcement of
judgments in Jersey from EU countries must be by way of an action at customary law.94
When Part II of the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960 is extended
to the superior courts of any foreign country, a judgment creditor under a judgment95 to
which the 1960 Law applies, may apply to the Royal Court at any time within six years after
the date of such judgment to have the judgment registered in the Royal Court, and on any
such application the Royal Court will order the judgment to be registered.96 No judgment
may be ordered by the Royal Court to be registered in Jersey if it has already been wholly
satisfied; or if it could not be enforced by execution in the country of the original court.97
Subject to the provisions of the 1960 Law with respect to the setting aside of registration,
a judgment once registered will be of the same force and effect as if the judgment had
been a judgment originally given by the Royal Court of Jersey and entered on the date of
registration.98
Any judgment of a recognised superior court99 of a country to which the 1960 Law applies100
is capable of registration if it is final and conclusive as between the judgment debtor and

92 See Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960, Art 10. To date, the States of Jersey has never
had recourse to this provision.

No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) [2012] OJ L 351.
94 The schedule of senior courts to which the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960 applies is
confined to a narrow number of jurisdictions; see note 99 below.

the judgment creditor or requires the former to make an interim payment to the latter;
and there is payable thereunder a sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of
taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty).101 It is also
to be implied that a foreign judgment is incapable of registration in Jersey if it contravenes
Article 9(4) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. Although the 1960 Law has not been amended
to reflect that position, it must be deemed to have been impliedly amended by the later
legislation.102
The Jersey statutory regime pertaining to the enforcement of foreign judgments is of limited geographical application and the judgments of courts of very many foreign countries
are not within its scope. It also, oddly, omits judgments of the Privy Council originating
from Guernsey and the Isle of Man which, it seems, can only be enforced in Jersey at customary law. Notwithstanding its status as a leading international finance centre, Jersey is
not currently a party to any bilateral or multilateral treaty for the reciprocal enforcement
and recognition of judgments that exist alongside the 1960 Law. Therefore the vast majority of foreign judgments that are capable of being enforced or recognised in Jersey are only
capable of being so at customary law.
Registration under the 1960 Law is available as of right and not at the discretion of the
Court. However, registration may or must be set aside if the judgment debtor shows certain
grounds and the judgment creditor may not levy execution until the time has passed within
which an application for setting it aside may be made.103
As at customary law, a judgment is deemed to be final and conclusive notwithstanding that
an appeal is pending or that it may still be subject to appeal in the foreign jurisdiction.104
However, the Court has a discretionary power to stay the execution of a judgment that is
registered or to set aside the registration of a judgment on such terms as it thinks fit, if the
applicant satisfies the Court that an appeal is pending or that he is entitled and intends to
appeal.105 And if upon an application for registration it appears that part or parts only of
the judgment are capable of registration, then such part or parts may be registered alone.
Registration is for the sum payable under the original judgment, plus interest due under
the law of the original court up to the date of registration, plus reasonable costs incidental
to registration.106 Where the judgment has been partially satisfied, registration is for the
unsatisfied balance.107

A. Jurisdiction of the Foreign Court
The 1960 Law contains detailed rules on when foreign courts are deemed to have jurisdiction for the purposes of its provisions;108 these rules are modelled very closely on those of
the customary law rules.
The foreign court is deemed to have had jurisdiction in an action in personam:109
1.

15-51

15-52

if the judgment debtor submitted by voluntarily appearing otherwise than for the
purpose of protecting, or obtaining the release of, property seized, or threatened with
seizure, in the proceedings, or of contesting the jurisdiction of that court; or110
if the judgment debtor was plaintiff in, or counterclaimed in, the proceedings in the
original court; or
if the judgment debtor had before the commencement of the proceedings agreed, in
respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, to submit to the jurisdiction of that
court or of the courts of the country of that court; or
if the judgment debtor was at the time when the proceedings were instituted resident
in, or being a body corporate, had its principal place of business in, the country of that
court; or
if the judgment debtor had an office or place of business in the country of that court
and the proceedings in that court were in respect of a transaction effected through or
at that office or place.

4.

5.

The foreign court is deemed to have had jurisdiction in an action of which the subject matter was immovable property or in an action in rem if the property in question was, at the
time of the proceedings in the original court, situated in the country of that court.111
The grounds of jurisdiction in the 1960 Law are framed so as to reproduce the rules of the
customary law as closely as possible. No judgment can be registered under the 1960 Law
unless the jurisdiction of the foreign court can be brought under one of these heads, they
are exclusive not permissive.112
The principal differences between the customary law rules and the 1960 Law rules for the
recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment are that under the 1960 Law the foreign
court is not treated as having jurisdiction over an individual simply by virtue of his mere

108

ibid, Art 6(2) and the proviso in Art 6(3).
ibid, 6(2)(a). A judgment in personam for the purposes of the 1960 Law does not include any matrimonial
cause or any proceedings in connection with any of the following matters: ie, matrimonial matters, administration of the estates of deceased persons, bankruptcy, winding up of companies, lunacy or guardianship of infants
(see Art 2(2)), and so the foreign jurisdiction requirements will be based not on the statutory tests in Art 6 but on
customary law tests discussed above.
110 This is the equivalent of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, s 33 which has no substantive
equivalent at customary law; see para 15-22 above.
111 Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960, Art 6(2)(b).
112 Note the 'only' in Art 6(2) of the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960. In New Cap
Reinsurance Corp Ltd (In Liquidation) v Grant [2011] EWCA Civ 971, [2011] BPIR 1428, it was held that that even
though the foreign court could not be shown to have had jurisdiction by reference to any of the jurisdictional
grounds in the Act, if a judgment were nevertheless registered and an application made to set it aside, that application could be resisted if the judgment was the subject of a request for assistance in insolvency, following Rubin
v Eurofinance SA [2010] EWCA Civ 895, [2011] Ch 133.

presence in the foreign jurisdiction. Presence in the jurisdiction is a head of jurisdiction at
customary law.113 Further, under the 1960 Law the foreign court will have jurisdiction over
a corporation only if either (1) it was resident or has its principal place of business in the
foreign country or (2) it has an office or place of business in the foreign country and the
cause of action arose from a transaction effected through that office.114 At common law it
is sufficient that there be a place of business irrespective of its status or how or where the
cause of action arose.115
The complete satisfaction of the foreign judgment, or the circumstance that mean it could
not be enforced by execution in the place where it was given, are absolute bars to registration under the 1960 Law.116
Registration is liable to be set aside on certain specified grounds upon the application of
any party against whom it is enforceable made within a time specified in the registration
order117 if the Court is satisfied:
1.

that the judgment is incapable of registration under the Act or has been registered in
contravention of it; or
that the courts of the country of the original court had no jurisdiction in the circumstances of the case; or
that the judgment debtor, being the defendant in the original proceedings, did not
receive sufficient notice to enable him to defend and he did not appear; or
that the judgment was obtained by fraud; or
that the enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to English public policy; or
that the rights under the judgment are not vested in the applicant for registration.118

Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments

While notice of proceedings is not a requirement at customary law, it does have
relevance in so far as a foreign judgment may be impeachable for want of compliance with
principles of natural justice. The provisions with regard to fraud and public policy are the
same as the common law rules.119
Registration may be set aside under the 1960 Law if the Court is satisfied that the matter
in dispute in the original proceedings had previously to the date of judgment in those proceedings been the subject of a final and conclusive judgment by a court having jurisdiction
in the matter.120
Where registration is set aside on the ground that an appeal is pending or that the applicant is entitled and intends to appeal the right of a judgment creditor to apply again later
for registration is not prejudiced.121 The same rule applies in a case where registration is

set aside on the sole ground either that the judgment was not enforceable by execution in
the country of the original court or that, having been registered for the whole sum payable
thereunder, it has been partially satisfied.122 In all other cases the setting aside of registration is presumably a bar to a second application for registration.

B. The Procedure for Registration of a Foreign Judgment under the
Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960
An application for registration in accordance with the 1960 Law is made by way of an ex
parte application.123 An application for registration under the 1960 Law is business that
may be transacted before the Greffier and it is unnecessary to convene the Inferior Number
unless it appears to be doubtful whether an application to register the foreign judgment
should be granted.124
The application for registration must be supported by a certified copy of the foreign judgment (with a certified translation thereof if the judgment is not either in French or English)
as well as an affidavit the contents of which are prescribed by the rules.125 The affidavit must
address that to the best of the deponent's information and belief:
1.
2.

15-61

15-62

that the applicant is entitled to enforce the judgment;
as the case may require, either that at the date of the application the judgment has not
been satisfied, or, if the judgment has been satisfied in part, what is the amount that
remains unsatisfied;
that at the date of the application the judgment can be enforced by execution in the
country of the court from which it was obtained;
that if the judgment were registered in Jersey, the registration would not be, or be liable
to be, set aside under Article 6 of the 1960 Law; and
specifying the amount of the interest, if any, which under the law of the country of the
court that gave the foreign judgment is due up to the time of registration.

3.
4.
5.

A notice and the Act of Court126 granting leave to register the foreign judgment must be
served on the judgment debtor.127 If the judgment debtor is out of the jurisdiction, the
notice can be served on him without seeking leave.128 Enforcement under the 1960 Law is
by way of registration (unlike at customary law where it is by action), and so the judgment

debtor need have no connection with Jersey or have submitted to the jurisdiction of the
Royal Court, although in practice registration will be pointless unless he has assets in Jersey.
Within three days of service, the person serving the notice and Act of Court129 must endorse
the notice (or provide an affidavit of service) stating the date it was served. A failure to
endorse the notice renders the registered judgment unenforceable in Jersey without leave of
the Court.130 The Court may of its own volition require the judgment creditor to provide
security for costs of the application for registration and of any proceedings which may be
brought to set the registration aside.131

C. The Effect of Registration
15-65

The effect of registration of a foreign judgment under the 1960 Law is to render it,
for purposes of execution, of the same force and effect as if it were a judgment of the
Royal Court.132 The Royal Court has the same control over execution as it has over the
execution of its own judgments. There may be no execution of the judgment so long as it is
open to any party to make an application for the setting aside of the judgment or until the
final determination of any such application.133 Proceedings may be taken upon a registered
judgment exactly as if it were a judgment of the Royal Court.134 Where the judgment sum
for which registration is sought is in a currency other than sterling, there will be a conversion to sterling on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the judgment
of the original court.135 The judgment will be registered for the reasonable costs of and
incidental to registration, including the costs of obtaining a certified copy of the judgment
from the original court.136 The sum for which a foreign judgment is registered carries interest in the same manner as any other Jersey judgment debt.137

D. Basis upon which Registration May Be Set Aside
15-66

Registration must be set aside under the 1960 Law if the Royal Court is satisfied that the
courts of the country of the original court had no jurisdiction in the circumstances of
the case.138 Whether the foreign court had jurisdiction is to be determined by reference to the
principles discussed above.139 The Court must also set aside the registration of a judgment
if the bringing of the proceedings in the original court was contrary to an agreement under
which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts
129 In the case of service within the jurisdiction through the Viscount, a proof of service will be provided
automatically.

of the country of that court140 or if the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original
proceedings, was a person who under the rules of public international law was entitled to
immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the country of the original court and did
not submit to the jurisdiction of that court.141
The Court must also set aside the registration in any of the following circumstances:142
1.

2.
3.

15-67

that the judgment debtor, being the defendant in the proceedings in the original court,
did not (notwithstanding that process may have been duly served on the judgment
debtor in accordance with the law of the country of the original court) receive notice
of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable the judgment debtor to defend the
proceedings and did not appear;
that the judgment was obtained by fraud;
that the enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to public policy in Jersey, or
that the rights under the judgment are not vested in the person by whom the application for registration was made.

The registration may be set aside if the Royal Court is satisfied that the matter in dispute
in the proceedings in the original court had previously to the date of the judgment in the
original court been the subject of a final and conclusive judgment by a court having jurisdiction in the matter.143

15-68

E. Procedure to Set Aside the Registration of a Foreign Judgment
An application to challenge the registration of the judgment is made by summons.144 The
summons must be served within the time specified in the Notice/Act of Court. The judgment debtor may apply to extend the time to set aside (usually as an additional head of
relief in the summons to set aside) and may do so even after the expiration of the time
period allowed in the Notice/Act of Court if the Court has set a time limit without full

law to collect on the judgment debt (ie the a judgment (or parts thereof) that cannot be the
subject of enforcement in Jersey are still capable of being recognised at customary law). The
1960 Law, like the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 upon which it is
based, preserves the common law rule as to the conclusiveness of any matter of law or fact
decided therein.147 The 1960 Law also contains a provision which states that a judgment to
which Part II of the 1960 Law applies, or would have applied if a sum of money had been
payable thereunder, whether it can be registered or not, and whether it is registered or not,
'shall be recognised in any court in Jersey as conclusive between the parties thereto in all
proceedings founded on the same cause of action and may be relied on by way of defence
or counterclaim in any such proceedings'.148 This provision is expressed not to apply where
the registration of a foreign judgment has been or could be set aside on any of the grounds
on which registration under Article 6(2) of the 1960 Law require it to be set aside (ie lack of
jurisdiction, fraud, lack of notice of the proceedings, public policy). The effect of Article 9
is to make applicable for the purpose of regulating the recognition of foreign judgments as
a general question the principles contained in Article 6. Thus where a judgment, had it been
a registered judgment, would have been liable to have its registration set aside either under
Article 6(1)(a) or Article 6(1)(b), then it is not to receive recognition.149
The expression 'a judgment to which Part II of this Act … would have applied if a sum of
money had been payable' is somewhat obscure. The House of Lords held by a majority in
relation to the identically worded provisions in the UK's 1933 Act (which is likely to be
instructive) that the section applies to judgments in favour of a defendant dismissing the
plaintiff 's claim.150
Under the 1960 Law, as at customary law, a foreign judgment is only conclusive as regards
the question actually adjudicated upon, so a foreign judgment obtained otherwise than
on its merits, such as one given in the defendant's favour on the basis that the action was
time barred, was not a bar to a subsequent action in England.151 Whether Article 9(1) is
capable of applying to foreign judgments that go to status rather than being just confined
to judgments in personam has not been definitively concluded in England in relation to
the equivalent provision to Article 9 in the 1960 Law, section 8(1) in the 1933 Act. The
extrinsic material on which the 1933 Act was based, and by extension the 1960 Law,152 do
not suggest that section 8 was intended only to be confined to judgments in personam.153
A literal interpretation of Article 9, in conjunction with the definition of judgment in
Article 3(2), suggests that judgments as to status are within the scope of Article 9(1). This

other than Jersey which is invalid under the law of that jurisdiction; and
(g) does not validate any testamentary disposition which is invalid under the law of the testator's
domicile at the time of his death.
(3) The law of Jersey relating to légitime shall not apply to the determination of any question mentioned in paragraph (1) unless the settlor is domiciled in Jersey.

(5) The rule donner et retenir ne vaut shall not apply to any question concerning the validity, effect
or administration of a trust, or a transfer or other disposition of property to a trust.

'légitime' and 'donner et retenir ne vaut' have the meanings assigned to them by Jersey customary
law;164
'personal relationship' includes the situation where there exists, or has in the past existed, any of
the following relationships -
(a)

any relationship between a person and the settlor or a beneficiary, by blood, marriage, civil
partnership or adoption (whether or not the marriage, civil partnership or adoption is
recognised by law);
(b) any arrangement between a person and the settlor or a beneficiary such as to give rise in any
jurisdiction to any rights, obligations or responsibilities analogous to those of parent and
child, husband and wife or civil partners; or
(c) any relationship between -
(i)
a person who has a relationship mentioned in either of paragraphs (a) and (b) with the
settlor or a beneficiary, and
(ii) a third person who does not have a relationship mentioned in either of paragraphs (a)
and (b) with the settlor or a beneficiary.
(7) Despite Article 59, this Article applies to trusts whenever constituted or created.

In short, the practical effect of the so-called 'firewall' is that in respect of a Jersey trust165 the
Royal Court will not enforce or otherwise give effect to any order of a foreign court on an
issue falling within Article 9(1) unless the foreign court has applied principles of Jersey law
in determining its judgment on that issue. Article 9 therefore represents a major derogation
to the customary law and statutory rules discussed above in relation to the enforcement
and recognition of foreign judgments in Jersey. The 1960 Law has in effect been impliedly
amended so as to include an additional basis on which to refuse recognition of a foreign
judgment under Article 6(1); namely that the foreign judgment differs as to its substance
to that which a Jersey court would have delivered.166 It appears to have the effect that the
Royal Court will deny recognition of a foreign judgment, even if the trustee submits to the
jurisdiction of the foreign court. Article 9 does not prevent the Court giving effect to a letter of request sent to it from a foreign court, even where the information that is sought for
foreign proceedings pursuant to the letter of request is information that the Court could
be expected to refuse disclosure of were the application made to it, sitting in its supervisory
capacity.167
The purpose of Article 9 is to afford Jersey trusts a measure of protection to withstand
interference, variation or attack by foreign courts. This was a particular concern with regard
to foreign court orders in the context of matrimonial proceedings, which purported to vary

Law 1984. For the meaning of donner et retenir ne vaut, see Abdel Rahman v Chase Bank (C.I.) Trust Co Ltd [1991

High Court in ancillary relief proceedings.169

(Jersey) Law 2012
15-76

15-77

15-78

The version of Article 9 that existed between 27 October 2009 and 2 November 2012 introduced for the first time into Jersey law a prohibition on the enforcement of a foreign judgment that had not applied Jersey law in its determination of any matter listed in Article 9(1).
Prior to the enactment of the current version of Article 9, the Royal Court regularly gave
effect to orders of foreign courts that had the effect of varying a Jersey trusts.170 In doing so
it has expressed the view that it regarded it an exorbitant assumption of jurisdiction for a
foreign court to seek to pronounce, on the basis of its own law, upon whether a ­Jersey trust
was a sham which the Royal Court would be very reluctant to give effect to or enforce.171
The Royal Court has also expressed a desire that English courts, particularly the Family
Division of the English High Court, exercise restraint and refrain from using their statutory jurisdiction to vary Jersey trusts under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and ride
roughshod over the distinct supervisory jurisdiction of the Royal Court to give appropriate
directions to the trustee, which in many cases invariably replicated the effect of an English
order for variation.172
Section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 confers a jurisdiction on an English court
to make an order
varying for the benefit of the parties to the marriage and of the children of the family or either or
any of them any ante-nuptial or post-nuptial settlement (including such a settlement made by will
or codicil) made on the parties to the marriage… and… extinguishing or reducing the interest of
either of the parties to the marriage under any such settlement.173

Jersey law has no equivalent jurisdiction to that conferred by section 24(1)(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The Family Division of the Royal Court possesses a more limited
statutory jurisdiction to vary a post-nuptial settlement under Article 27 of the Matrimonial
Causes (Jersey) Law 1949.174 It follows that there is no Jersey law counterpart (other than
perhaps the jurisdiction under Article 47 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984)175 that could be
applied by a foreign court so as to make the variation compliant with Article 9(1).
It is to be appreciated that the function of the foreign court in matrimonial proceedings
and the Royal Court are different in the context of matrimonial disputes concerning a
Jersey trust. The foreign court is concerned to do justice and achieve a fair allocation of
assets between the spouses before it. In the exercise of that jurisdiction, the foreign court is
not generally concerned to consider the other beneficiaries of the trust. The Royal Court,
by contrast, is likely to be sitting its supervisory jurisdiction over the trust when the trustee
returns to it for directions as to what it should do pursuant to the foreign matrimonial
order. The primary consideration of the Royal Court will be to approve decisions that are
in the interests of all the beneficiaries as a class, which may include one or both of the
spouses.176
A foreign judgment varying the terms of a Jersey trust under section 24 of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1973 is not a judgment to which the 1960 Law can apply.177 In most cases, the
trustee will not have submitted to the jurisdiction of the English court, with the result that
that court would not be deemed by the Royal Court to have had jurisdiction for the purposes of the 1960 Law anyway.178 If such a judgment falls outside the scope of the 1960 Law,
does the Royal Court have a jurisdiction to recognise or give substantive effect to a foreign
order purporting to vary a Jersey trust as a matter of customary law? It had been thought
that the previous incarnation of Article 9, as the Court identified in In the Matter of the B
Trust,179 did not exclude the possibility that the Court may, as a matter of judicial comity,
give effect to an order of a foreign court varying a Jersey trust.180 The leading reported decision on the previous version of Article 9 suggests that the answer was yes (at least in so far
as the foreign order effects a variation to a Jersey trust and not an alteration).181
The Court would consider whether the judgment of a foreign court that is sought to be
enforced in Jersey has the effect of altering the trust or effecting a variation of the trust. An
alternation to the trust is a direction to the trustee to do something it did not have power
to do. A variation on the other hand was a direction to the trustee that did not depart from
174 See J v M [2002 JLR 330] for an understanding of post-nuptial settlements in Jersey law, which is narrower
(and so are the Court's powers) than the meaning of that phrase and scope of the jurisdiction to vary under the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, s 24(1)(c).
175 Although note proposals in the draft Trusts (Amendment No 7) (Jersey) Law 20XX, which that would
amend Art 47 to confer upon the Court a power to vary a trust regardless of whether that variation is supported
or opposed by any one or more of the adult beneficiaries.

the terms of the trust and could be achieved by the exercise of the trustee's existing powers.182 In IMK Trust it was held that notwithstanding the prohibition on enforcement of a
foreign order under Article 9(4), where the foreign order merely varied the trusts, the Royal
Court could achieve the objectives of the foreign order, having regard to the interests of the
beneficiaries as a class, under its discretionary supervisory jurisdiction.183 The giving of
directions in this way was not said to amount to the enforcement of the foreign judgment
for the purposes of Article 9(4).184 Conversely, a foreign order that amounted to an alteration could not be recognised or given effect to by the Royal Court as the Court does not
have an unfettered power to rewrite the terms of a trust outside of its statutory jurisdiction
in Article 47.185 In giving effect to a foreign order varying a trust, the Royal Court was not
exercising its jurisdiction under Jersey law to vary but is actually giving directions to the
trustee pursuant to Article 51 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 concerning the administration of the trust and, in particular, whether and if so, to what extent, to give effect to the
foreign court's order.186
However, the Article 9(4) considered by the court in IMK Trust has since been amended to
prohibit the Royal Court enforcing or giving effect to the order of a foreign court that is
inconsistent with Article 9. Contrary to what was suggested in earlier authority187 the Court
does not retain an overarching residual power to give effect to judgments on the basis of
comity in the teeth of the statute. However the decision in IMK Trust predates the enactment of the current version of Article 9188 which has refined the statutory framework upon
which the IMK Trust decision was based with the result that the Royal Court now has no
power to enforce or otherwise give effect to a foreign order purporting to vary a Jersey trust
that falls foul of the firewall.

Prior to the enactment of the current version of Article 9,189 it had been thought that notwithstanding the prohibition on enforcement of a foreign judgment in Jersey that did not
comply with Article 9, it was in effect still possible to circumvent the prohibition on direct
enforcement of the foreign judgment by means of the Royal Court directing the trustee to

vary the terms of the trust to administer the trust in a fashion so as to bring about the end
sought in the foreign judgment.190
Since Article 9 was extended to preclude the Royal Court giving effect to any judgment not
in compliance with its terms, it is no longer even possible for the Royal Court to direct
the trustees, acting within the powers that they have, in a way that would give substantial
effect to such a judgment.191 The prohibition on the Royal Court giving effect to a foreign
judgment that falls foul of Article 9 is not expressed to be limited in any way. The inclusion
of the words 'given effect' as well as 'enforced' by the 2012 amendments suggests that any
judgment that falls foul of Article 9 is to be given no effect in Jersey whatsoever, leading to
the result that not only can a foreign judgment not be enforced in Jersey, it cannot even be
recognised in Jersey as giving rise to a chose jugée so as to preclude the parties re-litigating
the same issue again before the Royal Court. For the Royal Court to hold that a foreign
judgment precludes the issue being re-litigated in Jersey is, in effect, to recognise that the
foreign court's determination is final and conclusive as between the parties. It has not yet
been decided whether Article 9(4) has this effect.
If this is the correct interpretation of Article 9(4) (and there is no reason to consider it does
not mean what it says) it follows that parties to proceedings are able to have two bites of
the same cherry; first, having opportunity to adduce evidence of Jersey law into the foreign
proceedings and then (assuming the foreign judgment is not reached in accordance with
Jersey law principles) coming before the Royal Court to re-litigate the same issue in fresh
proceedings. It also means that if a foreign judgment is not to be given effect, it is not to be
given effect for all purposes and so a party to foreign proceedings in whose favour the Jersey
trust issues are determined positively (eg where an allegation that a Jersey trust is a sham is
made in England and fails) is given no credit in Jersey for having defeated the allegation of
sham abroad and would have to defend the allegation again on the merits in Jersey.
If this is not the correct interpretation to be given to Article 9, and the prohibition on the
Royal Court giving effect to a judgment falling foul of Article 9 is that the issue as determined by the foreign court, even if Jersey law is not applied, is recognised as giving rise
to a chose jugée in Jersey, then not only does the firewall serve to ring-fence the issues in
Article 9(1) from interference by the foreign court but also the parties have only one opportunity to litigate the issue if they wish it to be enforced or given effect to in Jersey.

C. The Efficacy of the Firewall
The practical efficacy of the firewall is very much dependent upon the location of the assets
and of the trustee. Article 9 operates most effectively where the trustees and the trust assets
are located behind the firewall, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Royal Court. Where
the trust assets are located outside of Jersey and so beyond the jurisdiction of the Royal

190 See earlier decisions. The Court has no inherent power to direct the trustee to do something they themselves
had no power to do without the concurrence of all the adult beneficiaries; In The Matter of the IMK Family Trust

15-87

Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments

Court to protect them,192 the efficacy of Article 9 is likely to questionable, particularly if the
assets are immovable or otherwise subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the court making
the order in respect of them. While Article 9 appears to have the effect that the Royal Court
will not enforce or give effect to a foreign judgment even where the trustee submits to the
foreign court, where the trustee has submitted to or is otherwise within the jurisdiction
of the foreign court making the order, it cannot realistically hope to raise Article 9, a rule
of foreign law, as a compelling reason before that foreign court why that court should not
make any order it has power to make in its own territory or as a defence as to why it has not
complied with the foreign court's order.
15-88

In either of the latter circumstances, the trustee is likely to need to apply to the Royal Court
for directions: first, as to whether it should submit the jurisdiction of the foreign court and,
secondly, whether (if it has power to do so) it should give effect to the foreign order.

i. The Trustee's Decision whether or not to Submit to the Jurisdiction
of a Foreign Court
15-89

15-90

15-91

It appears from the Jersey authorities that predate the current version of Article 9 that the
willingness of the Royal Court to overcome its reluctance in enforcing and giving effect to
a foreign judgment varying or otherwise interfering in the administration of a Jersey trust
was heavily dependent upon whether the trustee submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court was likely to be a significant factor.193
It has been suggested that it will not generally be in the interests of the beneficiaries (as a
class) for the trustee to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court in matrimonial proceedings in which one or both of the spouses are beneficiaries under the trust.194 To do so
would, on orthodox conflict of laws principles, confer a jurisdiction on the foreign court to
act to the detriment of the beneficiaries who are not before it. Not submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court will, at the very least, preserve the trustee's freedom of action
when a foreign order is sought to be enforced, at which point it is likely the trustee will once
again seek the Court's direction.
However, it is apparent from the current version of Article 9 that submission to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is no longer the touchstone for the enforcement of the foreign
decision in Jersey for judgments falling within its scope.195 Instead, the key question in
respect of foreign judgments falling with the scope of Article 9 is whether the foreign court
has applied Jersey law in its determination irrespective of whether the trustee has submitted. Of course, where the foreign order does satisfy the requirements of Article 9, the trustee, having voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court, will not be able

192 It cannot be assumed that a foreign court will not regard a party's reliance on Art 9 as an attempt to exert an
exorbitant jurisdiction that it (the foreign court) should disregard in reaching its determination.

the trustee when the judgment was sought to be enforced in Jersey. Described as an unhappy state of affairs in

to seek to argue that the order should not subsequently be given effect to in Jersey. This is a
major derogation from the position at customary law discussed above.
Notwithstanding the foreign court's jurisdiction is no longer the central issue in respect
of judgments falling within Article 9, the decision whether to submit to the jurisdiction is
likely to be a momentous decision for which the trustee is usually well advised to obtain the
direction of the Royal Court.196
The presence of trust assets within the jurisdiction of the foreign court is likely to be the
most significant factor in the trustee's decision whether or not to submit to its jurisdiction because without submission to the jurisdiction, the trustee cannot practically defend
those assets from enforcement in accordance with its duties.197 Whether it does or does
not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court it has been recognised that the trustee
should provide the foreign court (whether directly by its own submission or via such of the
beneficiaries that do submit if the trustee does not itself submit) with the fullest financial
information concerning the trust to ensure any determination or settlement is based upon
the true position and not supposition.198 Another factor is whether or not the trustee's
decision not to submit to the foreign court's jurisdiction is likely to leave the trustee open
to criticism and even a breach of trust claim by the beneficiaries if the trust comes to be
a varied by the foreign court to the prejudice of the beneficiaries who are not party to the
matrimonial proceedings.199
Where the location of the trust assets or the trustee means the trustee has limited options to
protect the assets from the enforcement of an order of a foreign court the trustee is likely to
need to make an application to the Royal Court under Article 51. The issue in the application is not that the trustee needs a direction from the Court as to whether it can satisfy the
foreign judgment from the trust assets (the Court has no jurisdiction to give that sort of
direction if the foreign judgment has been reached contrary to Article 9(4)). The object of
such an application is instead to enable the trustee to seek the Court's protection from the
possibility of a breach of trust action being brought against it from disgruntled beneficiaries as a result of the trustee having effectively lost trust assets in the event of enforcement
being taken against them in the foreign jurisdiction.
While Article 9 does not permit the Court to direct the trustee to effect a variation in the
trusts so as to give effect to a foreign judgment, the Royal Court retains jurisdiction to
bless a trustee's own decision (which is likely to be a momentous decision) to give effect
to a foreign judgment. The approval of a momentous decision already taken by the trustees themselves is not an order enforcing or giving effect to a foreign judgment.200 When
deciding whether or not to bless a momentous decision, the Court is not exercising its
own discretion but is instead making a declaration that the trustee's proposed exercise of
the power is lawful and reasonable. The consideration is whether the decision falls within
the range of decisions that a trustee, properly exercising its power, is entitled to make
(even if the Court would balance the factors differently and might have reached a different

decision). The Court will be reluctant to provide a general sanction to a trustee in respect
of its past conduct.201
The only circumstances in which the Court itself would make the decision would be where
the trustee (for valid reasons) surrenders its discretion to the Court. The Royal Court has
not yet determined whether a decision that the Royal Court itself reaches on behalf of the
trustee amounts to the Court giving effect to a foreign judgment. Such an exercise of the
Court's discretion is not qualitatively different from a direction that the trustee affects a
variation to the way the trust is administered so as to give effect to a foreign order which,
since 2012, the Royal Court has no power to do.
Notwithstanding that the trustee has submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court,
and that all relevant parties (including the trustee) were before it, that trust assets were
within its jurisdiction and where the foreign court delivers a carefully considered judgment
designed to do justice between the parties, the Royal Court is still required to refuse to give
effect to it. This was described in the In re B Trust202 as an unhappy state of affairs which
lead the Royal Court to conclude that the then Article 9(4) could not possibly mean what
it purports on its face to say. However, the decision in IMK Trust, the subsequent amendments to Article 9(4) and Otto Poon decisions appear to make clear that the statute does in
fact appear to mean exactly that.
There has yet to be a decision providing guidance as to what a trustee should do where a
foreign court has subjected the trust to an order effecting a variation, there are assets that
are vulnerable to enforcement within the jurisdiction of the foreign court but the trustee
has no power to give effect to the foreign order and so cannot seek the Court's blessing of
its own decision to give effect to the foreign judgment.

Prescription of Actions
I. Introduction: Prescription or Limitation?
In Jersey law, the rules applicable to the barring of claims by the effluxion of time, known as
prescription, remain largely a creature of the island's customary law.1 While there has been
piecemeal codification in some areas, including in relation to trust disputes, there is, as yet,
no overarching consolidating statute containing the full panoply of relevant prescription
periods applicable to causes of action across all areas of Jersey law. Somewhat confusingly,
the language of the law uses both the terms 'limitation' and 'prescription' interchangeably
in respect of different causes of action2 although the use of the term 'prescription' is considered to have a far more established pedigree in the island. This use of different terminology
is attributable, at least in part, to Jersey's status as customary law jurisdiction, with a mixed
civil law, based upon the ius commune, and common law heritage. While prescription and
limitation appear to be used interchangeably in a number of the authorities, the fundamental conceptual distinction between the two appears to depend on whether the plaintiff 's
right to bring an action has been barred or if the substantive rights in the object of the
proceedings have been altered by the passage of time.3 Limitation is a procedural defence,
which focuses on the action or claim.4 Prescription refers to the impact of the effluxion of
time on the underlying right to ownership. Despite their different conceptual underpinnings practically, both terms lead to similar ends, the possible extinction of a claim or a
right. Prescription is a concept first found in Roman law and can trace its pedigree in Jersey
back through Norman customary law. It is either 'acquisitive' in that a person is allowed to
acquire title to an object or property after a specified period of time or 'extinctive' in that it
extinguishes the right of the previous owner or possessor. In this chapter, we are concerned
with the use of prescription in this extinctive sense.5 The concept of limitation works differently, focusing on the action or claim rather than the underlying substantive right. At the

end of the prescribed period, a failure to bring the action before the Court will procedurally bar the plaintiff from asserting the right, if it has not already been effectively barred
through the operation of the doctrines of laches or acquiescence.6 Assuming the action is
barred does not necessarily mean that the substantive right has been extinguished, although
for all practical purposes, an inability to bring the claim to court for a remedy may amount
to the same thing. The result is that the claim is unenforceable or 'imperfect' but limitation
does not render it void.7

II. Article 57(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984-Actions
to Recover Trust Property from the Trustee and Frauds
to which the Trustee Was a Party or Privy
16-2

Prescription in relation to trust disputes before the Royal Court has, to a significant degree,
been the subject of (at least partial) statutory codification but in certain instances the Royal
Court has had to apply time limits by analogy with other causes of action.8 Claims for an
action founded on a breach of trust are covered by the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.9 There, there
is a three-year time limit for bringing an action for breach of trust before the Royal Court.
However, Article 57 is not to be regarded as a wholly self-contained code governing how
prescription operates in relation to trust disputes. The legislation is at best a framework that
is buttressed by and interacts with applicable prescription rules (some of which are uncodified) applicable to other kinds of jural relationships.10 It should be noted that Article 57 of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 does not apply to a trust whose proper law is not that of Jersey,
suggesting that the Royal Court will apply the equivalent prescription or limitation period
applicable under the proper law of the trust.11 While a breach of trust claim is usually prescribed after three years from the date of breach, the policy of the 1984 Law is to accord special treatment, in terms of prescription, to claims falling with Article 57(1), which provides:
57 Limitation of actions or prescription12
(1) No period of limitation or prescription shall apply to an action brought against a trustee-
(a)

in respect of any fraud to which the trustee was a party or to which the trustee was privy; or

6 CS Le Gros, Traité du Droit Coutumier de l'Ile de Jersey (Jersey, Les Chroniques de Jersey, 1943) at 230
describes prescription, by reference to the Ancien Coutumier as 'une preclusion de réponse procrééé de temps procédé ou escheu' [estopped from requiring an answer or response by time or the happening of events] combining
elements of acquisitive prescription (in the sense of things caused by time being passed) and extinctive (in the
sense of avoiding a reply or response to what is being asserted).

rules governing when such personal liability will end by reason of the effluxion of time.

(i)
in the trustee's possession,
(ii) under the trustee's control, or
(iii) previously received by the trustee and converted to the trustee's use.

The indefinite prescription period in respect of actions falling within Article 57(1) is not
solely to reflect any especial degree of opprobrium in which a trustee who commits a fraudulent breach of trust or retains trust property is to be held.13 The perpetual liability of a
trustee under Article 57(1)(b) is rationalised on the basis that a trustee is deemed to be
incapable of acquiring a beneficial interest in the trust property simply by reason of its possession or control of the trust assets.14 While it is possible to analyse the appropriation of
trust assets to the trustee for his own use as giving rise to a constructive trust and a proprietary claim in the beneficiaries to see the assets returned, the trust that arises over the assets
is but an extension of the trusts to which the assets are already subject.15

The article does not provide for who may bring the action against the trustee. It can be

An object of a fiduciary power had locus to bring proceedings for breach of trust and seek
relief, including the reconstitution of the trust fund if loss had been caused to it by a trustee's breach of trust.16 An action by the Attorney General, who has locus to enforce a charitable trust, is subject to no statutory time limits.17

and/or purports to act as trustee, sometimes called a trustee de son tort, is also included.20
As a matter of common sense, the subsection must be taken as extending to a former trustee; were it otherwise a trustee who commits a fraudulent breach of trust so as to in effect
'empty' the trust fund and purport to end it would be able to walk away and thereby drive
a coach and horses through the purpose of the provision. Persons who assume fiduciary
obligations, such as company directors, but without any express trust are treated in the
same way as express trustees and no limitation period applies to their fraudulent breaches
of trust.21 A director of a company is treated as a trustee of property of the company coming under his control.22 Even a de facto director of a company who received the company's
property without the company's authority has been held to be within the equivalent provision in the English Limitation Act 1980.23 Outwith the scope of the term 'trustee' in Article
57 is a 'category two' constructive trustee, such as a dishonest assistant or a knowing recipient no longer holding trust assets.24

C. Article 57(1)(a)-a Fraud to which the Trustee was a Party or Privy
16-6

The Jersey courts, like the English courts have been reluctant to lay down an all-encompassing
proposition of what constitutes a fraud, making fraud something of an elephant test. Fraud
in this context connotes an intention on the part of the trustee to pursue a particular course
of action, either intending that it is contrary to the interests of the beneficiaries or being
recklessly indifferent whether it is contrary to their interests.25 It is not necessary for the
plaintiff to prove a motive for personal gain on behalf of the trustee.26 Fraud in this context
is therefore wider than the criminal offence of fraud at customary law which criminalises
deliberate conduct intended to cause actual prejudice to someone and actual benefit to
the fraudster.27 Fraud, as used in Article 57(1), encompasses also the concept of civil or

equitable fraud, the equivalent Jersey customary law principle of 'dol'.28 That there appears
to be no distinction in the requirements imposed upon parties when pleading allegations of
fraud as opposed to dishonesty, acts of dishonesty by a trustee are also likely to fall within
Article 57(1).29 By reference to a now repealed incarnation of what is currently section
21(1)(a)-(b) of the Limitation Act 1980, Lord Evershed said: 'I think, clear that the phrase
covers conduct which, having regard to some special relationship between the two parties
concerned, is an unconscionable thing for the one to do towards the other'.
A trustee or other fiduciary who deliberately conceals a material interest of his own in a
transaction which he knows he ought to disclose commits a fraud within the meaning of
Article 57(1).30 A trustee may be liable for the fraud of his co-trustee if he comes within
Article 30(5), that is to say where the trustee becomes aware or ought reasonably to have
become aware of the commission of a fraudulent breach of trust or of the intention of his or
her co-trustee to commit a fraudulent breach of trust; and the trustee actively conceals such
breach or such intention or fails within a reasonable time to take proper steps to protect or
restore the trust property or prevent such breach.
A plaintiff beneficiary (or trustee on the beneficiary's behalf) does not have to plead a
charge of fraud in the first instance and can wait to see whether the defendant trustee raises
a limitation defence. Where Article 57(1) is relied upon the plaintiff must plead fraud in
reply and prove it, if he wishes to defeat a limitation defence. The burden is not on the
defendant trustee to disprove fraud to establish that the claim is statute barred.

D. Article 57(1)(b)-Possession, Control or Converted to the Trustee's Use
In order to come within Article 57(1)(b) the trust assets must ordinarily still be in the trustee's possession, control or have been converted to its use. A breach of the rule against the
trustee self-dealing with the trust assets will attract the operation of Article 57(1)(b). Article
57(1)(b) does not apply against a knowing recipient.31 A trustee is not treated as having

converted trust property to his use merely because it is so dealt with after the breach of trust
as to benefit the trustee in some indirect way, for instance where trust money advanced
in breach of trust is used by the borrower to pay off his overdraft and one of his bankers

16-10

Article 57(1) is in similar, though not identical terms to section 21(1) of the Limitation Act
1980.35 Section 21(1) provides, not that claims within it are incapable of being barred by
the lapse of time at all, but only that no period of limitation prescribed by the 1980 Act is to
apply. Recent English cases suggesting36 that claims within section 21(1) cannot be barred
by the doctrine of laches have been disapproved.37 Article 57(1) is wider in that it does not
confine itself to stating that no period of limitation prescribed by the 1984 Law is to apply,
providing only that no period of limitation or prescription shall apply to an action at all.
While the point has not been the subject of judicial consideration, in our view, an action
brought against a trustee for fraud or retention of trust property under Jersey law cannot
be time barred by a defence of laches. The modern English approach is to ask whether the
plaintiff 's actions have been such as to make it unconscionable for him to be permitted to
assert a claim.38 Whether a beneficiary has been guilty of delay so as to give rise to a defence
of laches one must consider the length of delay and the nature of the acts done during the
interval (such as a change of position or loss of evidence by the trustee) which might affect
either party and give rise to an injustice in allowing or not allowing a remedy.39 It should be
stressed that the Royal Court has not definitively determined whether the doctrine of laches
forms part of the law of Jersey and in respect of which causes of action it may be deployed.40

III. Article 57(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984-Actions
Founded on a Breach of Trust
If the claim is not of either kind described in Article 57(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, a
three-year prescription period applies to a claim for breach of trust. Article 57(2) provides:

16-11

(2) Where paragraph (1) does not apply, the period within which an action founded on breach of
trust may be brought against a trustee by a beneficiary is 3 years from -
(a) the date of delivery of the final accounts to the beneficiary; or
(b) the date on which the beneficiary first has knowledge of the breach of trust,
whichever is earlier.
[…]
(3A) Where paragraph (1) does not apply, the period within which an action founded on breach of
trust may be brought against a trustee by an enforcer is 3 years from -
(a) the date of delivery of the final accounts to the enforcer; or
(b) the date on which the enforcer first has knowledge of the breach of trust,
whichever is earlier.
(3B) Where paragraph(1) does not apply, the period within which an action founded on breach
of trust may be brought against a former trustee by a trustee is 3 years from the date on which the
former trustee ceased to be a trustee.
(3C) Where paragraph (1) does not apply, no action founded on breach of trust may in any event
be brought against a trustee by any person after the expiry of the period of 21 years following the
occurrence of the breach.

An action is brought for these purposes when originating process is served on the prospective defendant.41

A. Actions Founded on a Breach of Trust
In the authors' view the scope of Article 57(2) comprises a claim for a breach of trust including a claim against the trustee to recover trust property wrongly disposed of by the trustee
to a third party in breach of trust.42

16-12

i. Claim for Breach of Trust
The three-year period of limitation will apply to any action based upon a breach of trust
that does not fall within Article 57(1), ie any action that is not based upon a fraudulent
breach of trust or a retention by the trustee of the trust property. A breach of trust must
form the foundation for any action to which Article 57(2) applies. A beneficiary is entitled
to require an account in common form from their trustee at any point without limit of
41

See Ch 1.

42 As discussed in Ch 13, the beneficiaries' personal claim for breach of trust is usually secured by a lien on

the misapplied funds unless and until those misapplied funds cease to be traceable in the hands of a third party.

16-13

Prescription of Actions

time and without proof of a breach of trust.43 An account on the basis of wilful default
(which entails an allegation of impropriety and is thereby analogous to a claim based upon
a breach of trust) would fall within Article 57(2).44 Therefore, a claim to remove or replace a
trustee, if the action to remove, is founded on a breach of trust and will come within Article
57(2).45 A claim based on breach of the self-dealing rule (that a purchase of trust property
by the trustee should be set aside at the instance of any beneficiary) or the fair-dealing rule
(that a purchase of a beneficial interest by the trustee will be set aside unless scrupulously
fair) are claims based upon a breach of trust. Somewhat confusingly, claims for secondary
liability, that is to say claims for knowing receipt and dishonest assistance (category two
constructive trustees),46 though both 'founded' on a breach of trust, are outwith the scope
of Article 57(2),47 although a claim against the original trustee who has acted in breach of
trust would be.48

ii. Claim to Recover Trust Property
16-14

In light of Article 57(1)(b), a proprietary claim against a trustee to recover misapplied trust
property, or a personal claim (secured by lien on the traceable proceeds of the misappropriation) to restore the value of the assets is imprescriptible.49 Article 57(2) is concerned
with causes of action that are 'internal' to the trustee beneficiary relationship and so does
not extend to recovering trust property from non-trustees, eg persons to whom the trustees have wrongly transferred trust property, perhaps under a misapprehension as to the
construction or validity of provisions of the trust instrument, or by way of gift out of trust
property which the trustees have misappropriated. In such circumstances, the proprietary
claim will subsist for as long as there are traceable assets not in the hands of a bona fides
purchaser for value without actual notice of the prior beneficial interest in the assets.50
However, provided the misdirection of trust property was not fraudulent, the claim against
the trustee is subject to the three-year prescription period. Such circumstances may also
give rise to a personal claim in unjust enrichment51 which is not a cause of action to which
Article 57(2) applies. While there is no authority on the point, the authors' view is that such
a personal action is analogous to a claim for knowing receipt, which is prescribed after three

43 Dowse v Gorton [1891] AC 190 at 204; Partington v Reynolds (1858) 4 Drew 253 at 255-56, 62 ER 98 ('it is
sufficient that the Defendant holds the office').
44 Butler v Axco Trustees Ltd [1997 JLR N-17a].
45 However, the jurisdiction to remove and/or replace a trustee is a facet of the Court's inherent supervisory
jurisdiction and may be applied for by way of Representation at any time if there are appropriate grounds to do so;
see Letterstedt v Broers (1884) 9 App Cas 371; In re E Trust [2008 JLR 360]; Trilogy Management v YT & Ors [2014
(2) JLR N 31]. A beneficiary who knows of a breach of trust and sits on his rights for more than 3 years may have
difficulty satisfying the Court that it is the breach of trust (or loss of confidence arising from said breach) that is
prejudicial to the good administration of the trust.

although arguably it should do. The point was not taken before the Royal Court which was presented with a choice
between a 3-year period as being analogous with a claim in tort and a 10-year period applying to all personal claim
that were not otherwise already prescribed under another provision of Jersey law.

years (albeit that an action in unjust enrichment in Jersey may arise without any fault on
the part of the party enriched).52
If the transfer was made in fraudulent breach of trust, does Article 57(1)(a) (by which the
claim against the trustee is imprescriptible) exclude the possibility of a recipient of property
raising a limitation defence against a plaintiff beneficiary or trustee (given that that provision refers to a claim 'in respect of ' any fraud, even if the recipient himself has not been
fraudulent? Our view is that a proprietary claim in such circumstances (in common with
any available personal claim) is outside Article 57(1)(a) and that is so even if the recipient
is a party to the fraud.53 Where the breach is not fraudulent, the three-year time limit will
clearly apply.
Frequently the transfer will have been made under a misapprehension or mistake on the part
of the trustees. While such a transfer is capable of being set aside without proof of fault on
the part of the trustee54 a disposition of trust property on such a basis is nevertheless a breach
of trust and, if not fraudulent, subject to a prescription period of three years. However, unlike
under the Limitation Act 198055 the 1984 Law makes no specific provision for the postponement of limitation for an action seeking relief from the consequences of a mistake. It has
yet to be determined whether Jersey's statutory approximation56 of the erstwhile common
law jurisdiction of the court to reverse a transaction on grounds of mistake or under the
related doctrine known as the rule in Re Hastings Bass has a prescription period attached to
it. Article 47J is said to be without prejudice to any personal action for breach of trust against
a trustee notwithstanding the power of the Court to reverse a transaction coming within the
scope of Articles 47D to 47J. Given that a trustee will still be personally liable for breach of
trust for any loss to the trust caused by the disposition, it is very likely that an application to
court will be made well in advance of the three-year period expiring.57 This is particularly
the case where the Court cannot make an order to restore property that has been transferred
in breach of trust that would prejudice a bona fides purchaser for value without notice.58

B. The Accrual Date-From which Point Does Time Begin to Run?
Jersey does not operate the rule in English law that in a claim for breach of trust, time only
begins to run against a beneficiary with an interest in possession.59 The rationale upon

52 Bagus Investments Limited v Kastening (n 10); strictly, the decision is authority for the proposition that a
claim for knowing receipt is not within the scope of Art 57(1), not that such claims fall within Art 57(2).
53 See knowing recipients and innocent volunteers. The reason, being that a constructive trustee who is liable as
such only because of the very transaction which is impugned is not really a trustee and so is not within Art 57(1)
et seq. A recipient liable for knowing receipt is such a constructive trustee. A recipient liable under a Diplock claim
is not a constructive trustee at all but the case for treating him outside s 21(1)(a) is still stronger.

Prescription of Actions

which section 21(3) is based, as articulated by Millett LJ in Armitage v Nurse,60 is not that
a beneficiary with a future interest has no means of discovery of a breach of trust, but that
the beneficiary should not be compelled to litigation (at considerable personal expense) in
respect of an injury to an interest which he may never live to enjoy, does not apply to Jersey.61 A discretionary trust does not fall even within the terms of section 21(3) because an
object of a discretionary power is not a 'beneficiary entitled to a future interest in the trust
property'. Such an object has only the hope of acquiring an absolute or limited interest in
the trust property. The consequence of the rationale above is that a trustee of a discretionary trust cannot rule out a claim for breach of trust by a discretionary beneficiary until such
a beneficiary has taken (either by the effluxion of time by taking a share in the residual trust
fund at the end of the trust period or by a specific appointment) some part of the trust
fund.62 A very great number of Jersey law trusts are fully flexible discretionary trusts, with
wide powers as to the appointment of income and capital as well as the flexibility to widen
or narrow the class of discretionary objects.
It is for this reason that the 1984 Law provides the date of accrual to be the earlier of either
(1) the date of delivery of the final accounts to the beneficiary; or (2) the date on which the
beneficiary first has knowledge of the breach of trust. Without these statutory provisions,
the trustee's liability would be open-ended for decades following a breach of trust even if
there were only one discretionary beneficiary who had not received anything from the trust.
The trustee's potential open-ended liability has been cut down further by Article 57(3C),
which provides for a longstop prescription date of 21 years for breach of trust claims from
the date of breach regardless of the beneficiary's knowledge.

i. Delivery of the Final Accounts
16-19

16-20

The premise that underpins the rationale for the delivery of the final trusts accounts as the
moment from which time starts to run for the purposes of limitation, is that the accounts
should disclose and explain, to a reasonable degree of accuracy, the financial position of the
structure and the transactions undertaken. It follows that where the rationale for the delivery of accounts is not satisfied, because such accounts that are provided are inadequate to
understand what transactions have taken place, then there is likely to be scope for argument
that limitation should begin to run from a later date.
The Jersey Financial Services Commission's Codes of Practice for Trust Company Business
require a registered person (which all professional trustees must be in Jersey) to keep, or
satisfy itself that someone else is keeping, accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain every individual transaction.63 The trustees may also provide a financial statement
which should ordinarily include, in addition to the transactions entered into, a profit and

Since the Trusts (Amendment No 4) (Jersey) Law 2006 Jersey law has permitted a private trust of perpetual
duration. The trustee of such trust, in the absence of legislative provision to the contrary, would be liable to any
beneficiary who did not receive an appointment from the trust fund in perpetuity.

loss or income and expenditure account, a balance sheet and, depending upon its complexity, a capital account summarising capital distributions and additionally settled funds.
There is no legal requirement in Jersey for trusts to prepare a financial statement or, where
a financial statement is prepared, for it to be in compliance with an industry benchmark
such as GAAP. There is also no mandatory statement of law providing for the frequency by
which trust accounts should be rendered. In practice, the detail, format and overall quality
of the financial records provided by trustees to beneficiaries of Jersey trusts can vary
wildly across the industry, reflecting the nature of the entity in question. The absence of
mandatory standards in the content and frequency of trust accounting is likely to be self-­
correcting in that the longer the interval between which accounts are rendered, and the more
Spartan they are when provided, the greater the scope for argument that Article 57(2)(a)
has not been complied with. An additional complicating factor is that there is also wide
variation as to whom the trust accounts are routinely provided.64 While trust accounts
are within the class of documents of which the Court will routinely order disclosure upon
the beneficiaries' request, where it is the practice of the trustee to provide the accounts only
to a select number of named beneficiaries, time will not begin to run against those beneficiaries to whom accounts are not provided unless those beneficiaries come, by some other
means, to have knowledge of the breach of trust.

ii. Date of Knowledge
The reference to knowledge in Article 57(2)(b) is to 'knowledge that … would have led a
reasonable man to the inevitable conclusion that a breach of trust had actually occurred'.65
The statute does not expressly require it to be objectively reasonable for the plaintiff not
to have obtained the necessary knowledge sooner. It appears therefore that Article 57(2)
(b) is more generous to plaintiffs than the customary law position applying to the doctrine
of empêchement de fait, as the statute places no burden on the plaintiff to make reasonable
inquiries once on notice of the possibility of a claim. It suspends time from running until
the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge for a reasonable man to conclude that a breach had
occurred, rather than only until he ought to have had that knowledge had he been reasonably diligent. If this distinction does exist, it could be crucial in some cases.

16-21

C. Claims by Co-trustees or New Trustees for Breach of Trust
In circumstances where a trustee is un-conflicted in bringing a claim against a co-­trustee
or a former trustee, the trustee and not the beneficiary is the proper plaintiff to an action
for breach of trust.66 However, the claim cannot be said to be subject to an operative
empêchement as the beneficiaries are still able to bring a claim, either in their own names
or in the name of the trustee with leave to bring a derivative claim.67 Article 57(3B) is

accounts, see Ch 5.

Prescription of Actions

self-explanatory save that there is still some controversy, which is considered elsewhere, as
to whether the doctrine of empêchement de fait applies to Article 57(3B) so as to postpone
the commencement of the prescription period in a manner similar to that where the claim
is brought by beneficiaries, to either the earlier of a date of the trustee's knowledge or the
delivery of the final accounts.68

i. Claims for Contribution between Trustees
16-23

There is a curious gap in Jersey's law as to whether, first, a trustee who has compensated
his beneficiaries for a breach of trust, can recover a contribution from his co-trustees and
secondly, what (if any) prescription period applies to such a claim. Article 3 of the Law
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Jersey) Law 1960 is confined to contributions between
jointly and severally liable tortfeasors. In other words, under the 1960 Law both D1 and D2
must each be liable to P, in tort, in order that D1 may seek contribution from D2. While
two or more trustees may be made jointly and severally liable for the same breach of trust,69
a breach of trust or a breach of fiduciary duty is not a tort. The narrow jurisdiction of the
1960 Law was confirmed in Jersey Electricity v Brocken & Fitzpatrick:70
In England, the equivalent statutory provision was Section 6 Law Reform (Married Women and
Tortfeasors) Act 1935. The report of the Law Commission (Law Comm No 79) in 1977 recommended that the statutory right to obtain a contribution should be widened to cover the situation
where one or other of the parties (or both) was not a tortfeasor but was liable to the plaintiff for
breach of contract, breach of trust or other breach of duty. That was achieved by the passing the
Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. But in Jersey the position remains unaltered. It follows that
the defendant may only seek a contribution from the third party if the third party could be liable in
tort to the plaintiff, if sued, in respect of the damage which is the subject of the claim in the Order
of Justice.

16-24

In a claim against trustees, tortious and equitable duties may overlap.71 While a claim for
contribution for breach of an equitable duty would not come within the 1960 Law, where
it is possible to frame the claims made against the jointly and severally liable trustees as
tortious, ie a failure to act with the reasonable skill care and diligence, and seek the usual tortious remedy of unliquidated damages, then those claims could arguably come within the
scope of the 1960 Law. In our view, so far as contribution is possible, the prescription period
in respect of a contribution claim only begins to run from the time of judgment entered
against a defendant.72 Judgment in our view must include the award on quantum. Unlike
under section 10 of the Limitation Act 1980,73 Jersey law has not specifically provided a

68 An outgoing trustee is obliged to cooperate with an incoming trustee in rendering all trust documents
(including the trust accounts); In re Ogier Trustee (Jersey) Ltd [2006 JLR N [35]].

72 Bell v Heating & Ventilating Engr Co Ltd [1985-86 JLR 241].
73 Where the trustee seeking a contribution has been held liable by a judgment in civil proceedings or by an
award made on an arbitration, he has 2 years from the date of the judgment or the award in which to launch a
claim. If liability is established before quantum is fixed, the 2 years run from the date of the award on quantum
and not the earlier date of the judgment on liability.

time limit by which one trustee, who has compensated his beneficiaries for a breach of
trust, can recover a contribution from his co-trustee if the latter is liable in respect of the
same damage.

D. Laches Not Applicable74
Laches, in the sense of delay coupled with circumstances where it would be practically
unjust to give a remedy either because (1) the party has by his conduct done that which
might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver or (2) where by his conduct and neglect
he has though perhaps not waiving that remedy, put the other party in a situation in which
it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards asserted,75 does not
apply to breaches of trust falling outside Article 57(1).76 The rationale for this rule appears
to be that as an express statutory period of limitation applies to non-fraudulent breaches
of trust it is inconsistent not to allow a plaintiff the full benefit of that period by subjecting them to the doctrine of laches.77 Acquiescence, in the sense of conduct tantamount to
a release or capable of giving rise to an estoppel, remains a defence even before the expiry
of the three-year period. Neither a bare trustee nor a nominee nor a charitable trust for the
public benefit may ever plead laches against his beneficiary.78

16-25

IV. Constructive Trusts and Similar Liabilities
'Trust' and 'trustees' extend to constructive trusts and constructive trustees79 respectively,
although the inclusion of constructive trustees within Article 57(1) does not extend to all
persons who may be made liable under that description.80 In Jersey law, there are two categories of constructive trusts.81 The first category comprises those cases in which a defendant has assumed the duties of a trustee or fiduciary, doing so by a transaction which was

74 In Pell Frischmann Engineering Limited v Bow Valley Iran Limited (n 40) it was submitted that there was no
discernible indication of any Jersey court ever having applied the doctrine of laches, from which the Court did not
demure but holding that: 'Whether it goes by the name of laches or something else, the idea that in certain circumstances, a plaintiff may be refused some particular form of relief notwithstanding that his claim is not time-barred
appears to us, if nothing else, to be entirely compatible with a modern notions of justice'.

Prescription of Actions

independent of and preceded the breach of trust complained of (a 'category 1' constructive
trustee). The second category, comprises those cases in which the so-called trust obligation
arises as a direct consequence of an unlawful transaction which the plaintiff impugns and
in which the defendant is no more than a wrongdoer, eg where the defendant obtains property from the plaintiff by fraudulent misrepresentation (a 'category 2' constructive trustee).
Category 1s are true trusts; category 2s are not true trusts and are described as such merely
as 'a formula for equitable relief '. Importantly, category two constructive trustees may plead
limitation as a defence even in cases of fraud and retention or conversion of trust property
notwithstanding Article 57(1), which is confined to category 1 constructive trustees only.

A. Claims against Trustees de son tort
16-27

A person who voluntarily intermeddles in a trust and acts as a trustee, sometimes known as
a 'trustee de son tort',82 is a paradigm example of a category 1 constructive trustee, falling
within Article 57(1). Accordingly, a trustee de son tort cannot raise a defence of limitation
in the cases mentioned in Article 57(1) though is otherwise free to do so against claims falling outside that provision.

B. Inconsistent Dealing with Trust Property
16-28

A person who is not an express trustee may lawfully receive property knowing that it belongs
to a subsisting trust. Such recipients are nonetheless treated as constructive trustees, if they
retain the trust property for themselves or otherwise misuse it, and they can be made liable
as such. Since they do not assert a title adverse to the trust on taking possession, they are
treated as a category 1 constructive trustee for the purposes of limitation.83 Like a trustee
de son tort an inconsistent dealer of trust property cannot raise a defence of limitation in
the cases mentioned in Article 57(1) though is otherwise free to do so against claims falling
outside that provision.

C. Knowing Recipients
16-29

A knowing recipient of trust property is a person who receives trust property, for his
own benefit, transferred to him in breach of trust. A knowing recipient is treated as a
82 L Tucker, N Le Poidevin and J Brightwell, Lewin on Trusts, 19th edn (London, Sweet and Maxwell, 2014) at
42-101: 'If a person by mistake or otherwise assumes the character of trustee when it does not really belong to
him, he becomes a trustee de son tort and he may be called to account by the beneficiaries for the money he has
received under the colour of the trust. A trustee de son tort closely resembles an express trustee. The principle is
that a person who assumes an office ought not to be in a better position than if he were what he pretends; he is
accountable as if he had the authority which he has assumed. While it is essential, if a person is to become a trustee
de son tort, that he consciously takes the office of trustee, it does not matter whether he knows all the trusts or the
extent of his powers'.

Constructive Trusts

611

constructive trustee if at the time of receipt or later he had notice that the property was
trust property and that the transfer to him was a breach of trust. A knowing recipient is
a category 2 constructive trustee, his trusteeship arising only out of the very transaction
which the plaintiff beneficiary seeks to impugn. The critical distinction between a knowing
recipient and a person liable for inconsistent dealing is that the knowing recipient does but
the latter does not claim the trust property adversely to the trust. Because he is a constructive trustee of the second kind he is entitled to plead limitation to cases within Article 57(1).
The prescription period for a claim in knowing receipt is not provided for within the 1984
Law and has never been definitively determined by the Royal Court.84

D. Dishonest Assistants
A person who dishonestly assists a trustee to commit a breach of trust is himself liable as a
constructive trustee.85 The liability is based on the dishonesty of the accessory and the honesty or dishonesty of the trustee is irrelevant; it therefore follows that a claim for dishonest
assistance can arise from a non-fraudulent breach of trust.86 An accessory liable for dishonest assistance is a category 2 constructive trustee and is able to raise a limitation defence
even though the breach of trust in which he has dishonestly assisted falls within Article
57(1).87 The Royal Court also took the opportunity to state that a claim for dishonest assistance is not a claim 'in respect of any fraud to which the trustee was a party or to which the
trustee was privy' within the meaning of Article 57(1)(a). It follows that a dishonest assistant can plead limitation to any other claim falling within the rest of Article 57. The result
of Nolan, and the UK Supreme Court case of Williams v Bank of Nigeria88 that preceded it,
is that the interpretation of Article 57(1) and section 21(1) are now aligned.89 The Royal
Court in Nolan also considered what the appropriate period of prescription for a dishonest
assistance claim was, as like with knowing receipt, the answer is not obvious from the text
of Article 57. The result, while helpful in clearing up what had hitherto been ambiguous, is
not entirely satisfactory in terms of principle. In Esteem,90 it had been said:
The Jersey law of prescription is, by and large, based upon judicial precedent and it is hard to find
a consistent theme or principle which underlies the various prescriptive periods. But where there is
no precedent, it is helpful to have regard to the nature of the action91
[…]
We think that the time has come to hold that the 10-year period referred to by Le Geyt is a general
period which should be taken to apply to all personal actions and all actions concerning movables,

84 In Bagus Investments Limited v Kastening (n 10) the alternative period posited as an alternative to the 3-year
period under Art 57(2) was 10 years, as an action personnelles mobilières, applying In re Esteem Settlement (n 22)

save to the extent that they have already been held to be subject to a different period, eg tort, actions
concerning estates etc., or that some other period is, by analogy, clearly more applicable.92

16-31

16-32

The Court was presented with a choice; that of the prescription period being 10 years on
the basis that there was no other prescriptive period in Jersey law which could be applied
by analogy or three years on the basis that a claim in dishonest assistance was analogous to
an economic tort.93 The Court chose three years following a somewhat contorted line of
reasoning that incorporated dicta from cases from England and Hong Kong. In summary,
the nature of a dishonest assistance claim was held to be so close to that of accessory liability
in the context of economic torts that it was considered perverse to attempt to shoehorn the
cause of action for dishonest assistance into the existing canons of Jersey customary law.
It is deeply curious why recourse was made to such a contorted path in order to reach an
analogous cause of action when the foundation for a dishonest assistance claim is a breach
of trust and Article 57(2) already provides that the limitation period for an action 'founded
on breach of trust' is three years.
We do not understand the Royal Court to mean that dishonest assistance is a tort in Jersey
law.94 The two causes of action are clearly constituted of different elements, with different points of accrual and with different respective remedies. The prominence given to the
idea that a dishonest assistant is an interloper in the relationship between the trustee and
beneficiaries95 is also curious. Clearly, in cases of knowingly procuring a breach of contract
liability derives from the outsider's interference in the relationship between the contractual
parties, however in a case of dishonest assistance, the relationship between the beneficiaries
has already been soured by the trustee's own breach of trust to which the assistant is only
an accessory rather than the main protagonist. The Court in Nolan rejected the argument
that there can only be an analogy in terms of the applicable limitation period if two causes
of action are based on the same facts and give rise to concurrent remedies. The Court was
clear that what has to be analogous is the period, not the cause of action.96 With respect, it is
the authors' view that that statement appears to sheer whatever tenuous analogy that might
be made between the two cause of action, of any real meaning.

E. Claims against Innocent Volunteers who Receive Trust Property
16-33

Where trust property comes into the hands of a person not entitled to it and who has no
notice of the trust, he will be liable as a volunteer. To the extent that he is to be regarded as
a trustee at all, he is clearly a category 2 constructive trustee, since he has never assumed
the duties of a trustee or fiduciary. Where the trust property can be traced into the recipient's hands under the proprietary remedy discussed in Chapter 13, the action to do so is
generally barred by three years' delay. Such an action is not to recover trust property from

Constructive Trusts

a trustee under Article 57(1)(b) but is likely to be considered an action 'founded on breach
of trust' by the trustee in disposing of property to a volunteer. It is to be noted that Article
57 does not incorporate the wording found in section 21(3) of the Limitation Act 1980
of 'an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property'. To the extent that the alternative
personal remedy against an innocent volunteer can still be brought,97 the action would also
be an action founded on breach of trust. How the trust property comes to be in the hands
of an innocent volunteer does not affect the categorisation of the remedy for the purposes
of limitation. To the extent that the disposal of trust property is the result of a fraudulent
breach of trust, a defendant who has neither knowledge of the trust nor paid value for the
property is entitled to raise limitation as a defence even under Article 57(1). If there has
been a fraudulent breach of trust, this may form the basis for a case of concealment of
relevant facts for the purposes of postponing the accrual of the cause of action under the
doctrine of empêchement de fait.98 The cause of action on the personal claim against an
innocent volunteer would presumably accrue on the making of the wrongful payment,99
but the proprietary claim only accrues on the plaintiff becoming aware of his rights.100

F. Claims for Breach of the No-Profit Rule
A fiduciary who makes a profit from his trust is a category 1 constructive trustee in relation
to such property. A claim seeking recovery of a secret profit is a claim to recover property
properly belonging to the beneficiary101 within Article 57(1)(b) of the 1984 Law and there is
no prescription period applicable to such an action. This conclusion can be justified on the
grounds that the fiduciary relationship predates the acquisition of the new property (the
profit) by the fiduciary and the imposition of the constructive trust depends on the trustee's
pre-existing fiduciary responsibility for the property held within the trust, before acquisition by the trustee. Under English law, a fiduciary duty which prevents a person who owes
it from acquiring property which is the subject of that duty, will only make him a category 1
constructive trustee if he breaches that duty, if the fiduciary had a power of disposition over
the property.102 An exception is a director of a company. Though the company's property
is not vested in him, the director of a company will be treated as a category 1 trustee for
the company if he makes himself liable for procuring a transfer of the company's property
in his own favour.103 But if a director earns an unauthorised profit which does not depend
on any pre-existing responsibility of his for the property of the company, it has been held
that he is only a category 2 constructive trustee.104 Other fiduciary duties may be owed even
though there is no pre-existing property at all, for example a fiduciary who takes advantage

for his own benefit of information which came to him in that capacity105 or by a fiduciary
who accepts a bribe.106 Where a breach of fiduciary duty gives rise to a category 2 constructive trust claim, there is English Supreme Court authority on the equivalent of Art 57 to
suggest that such claims fall outside Article 57(1)(b) and Article 57(1)(a)107 The distinction
drawn in Paragon Finance108 is between two different kinds of trustees, those who actually
have accepted the duties of a trustee or (as in the case of a trustee de son tort or a director)
their equivalent, and those who are merely made liable as if they had done so. Only category
1 constructive trustees are the target of Article 57(1). The distinction does not depend on
the mental state accompanying the breach.

G Claims for Breach of the Self-dealing and Fair-dealing Rules
16-35

16-36

A trustee or other fiduciary who purchases trust property may have that transaction set
aside by any beneficiary, however fair the transaction. This is known as 'the (prohibition
from) self-dealing rule'. If a trustee or other fiduciary purchases a beneficial interest the
beneficiary may have the sale set aside unless the trustee shows that the transaction was
scrupulously fair. This is known as 'the fair-dealing rule'. Breaching either of these rules
is a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty.109 Article 57 of the Law does apply to breaches
of the self-dealing and fair-dealing rules by trustees.110 An express trustee acquiring trust
property in breach of the self-dealing rule is not in fact actually a constructive trustee at all
but remains an express trustee of the property; Article 57(1)(b) clearly prevents him from
raising a defence of limitation.111 A director who purchases from his company has been
held to be a category 1 constructive trustee and so is similarly unable to plead limitation
as a defence.112 However, the existence of a fiduciary duty in respect of the property before
the acquisition will not alone bring the trustee within category 1; he must in addition have
had a power of disposition over the property. In the absence of such a power he will be a
category 2 constructive trustee and able to rely on the three-year statutory time limit.113
Where a trustee engages the fair-dealing rule by purchasing a beneficial interest, it is not
clear that Article 57(1)(b) has any application; the beneficial interest was not itself held on
trust and hence a claim to set aside the transaction is not a claim to recover 'trust property'.
If Article 57(1)(b) does not apply, there is no distinction between an express trustee and
a constructive trustee of either the first or second category, and all of them could raise

a defence of limitation (unless fraud were alleged). In the authors' view, Article 57(1)(b)
ought to apply, on the ground that the objection to the transaction by the beneficiary is
substantially the same as to a case of self-dealing. On that footing, an express trustee could
never raise the defence and only a category 2 constructive trustee could do so. But even if
Article 57(1)(b) has no application to a breach of the fair-dealing rule, a charge of fraud
would engage Article 57(1)(a), so that again only a category 2 constructive trustee could
plead limitation as a defence.

V. Extension and Postponement of the Prescription Period
There is no direct Jersey equivalent of section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980 so as to suspend
limitation running in any action based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of
any person through whom he claims or where any fact relevant to the plaintiff 's rights of
action has been deliberately concealed from him by any such person or the action is for
relief from the consequences of a mistake (where the mistake was part of or an element
of the cause of action). Instead, Jersey has made specific statutory provision to suspend or
postpone the accrual date for the commencement of prescription in specific circumstances,
such as where the plaintiff is under a legal disability. Recourse may also be made to the Jersey customary law principle of 'empêchement d'agir' under which the Court has an inherent
flexibility to determine whether or not a litigant suffered from a practical impossibility in
pursuing his/her claims.

16-37

A. Statutory Suspension of Prescription for Breach of Trust Claims
The commencement of the prescription period of three years in Article 57(2) is suspended
in cases of disability. Article 57(3) provides:

16-38

(3) Where paragraph (1) does not apply but, when the breach occurs the beneficiary -
(a) is a minor;
(b) is an interdict; or
(c) is under any other legal disability,
the period to which paragraph (2) refers shall not begin to run before the beneficiary ceases to be a
minor or interdict or under that other legal disability (as the case may be), or sooner dies.

The word 'interdict' is defined in Article 1 of the 1984 Law to mean
a person, other than a minor, who under the law of Jersey or under the law of the person's domicile
is legally incapable of managing and administering his or her own property and affairs by reason
of mental disorder or of addiction.

Article 1 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 similarly defines a minor as 'a person who under
the law of Jersey or under the law of the person's domicile who has not reached the age
of legal capacity'. It is to be noted that a person may be a minor or an interdict under
the law of a territory that is neither the law of the forum (Jersey) nor the proper law of
the trust.

Prescription of Actions

i. Age
16-40

The drafting of Article 57(3) gives rise to an uncertainty. Jersey's age of majority is 18.114
Where a person is deemed still to be a minor in their place of domicile but would be treated
as being of age in Jersey, when does time begin to run? The same issue arises in the converse position where a person would be of majority in their country of domicile (say 16)
but remain a minor in Jersey. The drafting of Article 1(1) in relation to age would be much
improved by the addition of 'whichever is the later'. In the authors' view, the only sensible
way to read Article 1(1) is that a person will be a minor if they are a minor under either
the law of Jersey or the law of their domicile. A person is therefore given the benefit of a
longer period of minority if one is available to them. Were it otherwise, the consequences
of uncertainty with regard to age could be particularly acute when considering the limitation period for a non-fraudulent breach of trust is only three years. A beneficiary may be
of age in Jersey but not of age in their country of domicile until they are 21. The three-year
limitation period would expire on the date they were first able to bring an action under the
law of their domicile. Where there is a body of discretionary objects, all of different ages and
the trustee has power to appoint the whole trust fund to one or more of them, time will not
begin to run until the youngest of the objects ceases to be a minor.

B. Empêchement
16-41

In addition to the statutory provisions that suspend prescription running against minors,
interdicts and those under any other legal disability, recourse may also be had to the customary law principle of 'empêchement d'agir'115 which provides that prescription will not run
against a person who is subject to an impediment which prevents him from bringing a claim
or otherwise acting in the prosecution or defence of his rights. There are two116 types of relevant impediment: (1) an empêchement de fait; and (2) an empêchement de droit. A plaintiff
subject to an empêchement d'agir is described as being empêche until the empêchement is lifted.

i. Empêchement de droit
16-42

An empêchement de droit is a legal impediment disability. For example, where a party is a
minor, time will not run unless the minor has a tuteur.117 A minor for whom a tuteur has been
appointed will however have a right of action against the tuteur in cases of ­negligence.118
Similarly, where a person lacks mental capacity in circumstances where a curator has not yet
been appointed, time will not run against the incapacitated person. Time will run against a
mentally incapacitated person who has a curator.119 The Trusts (Amendment No 5) (Jersey)

Law 2012 extended the statutory suspension of prescription beyond minors to interdicts
and others under disability with the effect that Article 57(3) now appears to be co-extensive
with the customary law principle of empêchement de droit.

ii. Empêchement de fait
An empêchement de fait refers to a factual impediment which gives rise to a practical impossibility of commencing or continuing legal proceedings.120 The plaintiff bears the burden
of proof that they were subject to an operative empêchement. As long as the empêchement
is operative, prescription does not run against a plaintiff.121 The principle that is said to
underpin the principle of empêchment de fait is the practical impossibility of the plaintiff
being able to exercise his rights.122 The threshold is not whether it is impossible for a plaintiff to bring a claim but whether it is practically impossible for the plaintiff to do so.123 This
provides a degree of flexibility and latitude to a plaintiff on the particular facts in each case.
A person is assumed to be reasonably diligent in inquiring after his own situation; his own
negligence in doing so is not capable of giving rise to an empêchement.124 Where a plaintiff
is ignorant of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and such ignorance is objectively
reasonable, such ignorance is capable of amounting to an empêchement de fait.125 Ignorance per se is insufficient to stop prescription running and will not prevent the accrual
of a cause of action.126 The Court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, in
particular, of what was the plaintiff ignorant, why was the plaintiff ignorant, the relationship of the unknown factor to the plaintiff 's claim and its importance as an ingredient in
the cause of action. The test is whether ignorance is reasonable in all the circumstances: the
reasonableness of not knowing both the facts giving rise to the cause of action and that a
cause of action arises on the basis of such facts.127 In a claim which makes an allegation of
dishonesty, the basis for that allegation must be fully particularised.128 In Boyd, Beloff JA
said (at 291):
In my view, the epithet 'practical' deployed in Maynard softens rather than strengthens the concept of impossibility. It requires a consideration of what is in fact, not in theory, possible. While
ignorance of a cause of action does not per se trigger a suspension of the limitation period, it may,
in appropriate circumstances, constitute or create a relevant impediment. The issue before us is of
what those circumstances may consist.

non-fraudulent breach of trust, the defendant trustee can raise a limitation defence.

The test, as it seems to me, is whether ignorance of the cause of action is reasonable in all the circumstances, reasonable, that is, both in respect of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and that
a cause of action arises in such circumstances.

Sumption JA added (at 295):
What ignorance the law regards as reasonable is a matter of legal policy, the precise limits of which
will need to be explored from case to case. I am satisfied that the law regards ignorance as reasonable as a matter of legal policy where there was no means by which the particular plaintiff could
reasonably have been expected to discover the facts on which her cause of action was based.

a. Fraud and Concealment
16-44

It is often a feature of dishonesty and fraud cases that the fraudster will conceal his fraud
for as long as possible. Concealment of relevant facts is treated as a species of the principle
stated above; that ignorance of the existence of the plaintiff 's right of action can amount to
an empêchement de fait. Prescription will be suspended for so long as the plaintiff remains
ignorant of the fraud perpetrated against him129 and such ignorance was caused by the
defendant's concealment so that the plaintiff could not have discovered the fraud against
him or his right of action in respect of it, with reasonable diligence.130 In Nolan v Minerva
Trust, the Royal Court considered the impact of concealment of relevant facts on the ability of a plaintiff to properly plead its case. The Court held that any pleading of dishonesty
or fraud must be properly particularised in accordance with the principles set out by Lord
Millett in Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England,131 endorsed by the Royal Court in
Cunningham v Cunningham:132
184. It is well established that fraud or dishonesty (and the same must go for the present tort) must
be distinctly alleged and as distinctly proved; that it must be sufficiently particularised; and that
it is not sufficiently particularised if the facts pleaded are consistent with innocence: see Kerr on
Fraud and Mistake 7th ed (1952), p 644; Davy v Garrett (1878) 7 Ch D 473, 489; Bullivant v Attorney
General for Victoria [1901] AC 196; Armitage v Nurse [1998] Ch 241, 256. This means that a plaintiff
who alleges dishonesty must plead the facts, matters and circumstances relied on to show that the
defendant was dishonest and not merely negligent, and that facts, matters and circumstances which
are consistent with negligence do not do so.
[…]
186. The second principle, which is quite distinct, is that an allegation of fraud or dishonesty must
be sufficiently particularised, and that particulars of facts which are consistent with honesty are not
sufficient. This is only partly a matter of pleading. It is also a matter of substance. As I have said,
the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet. But since dishonesty is usually a matter
of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted
dishonestly, but also the primary facts which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference. At

trial the court will not normally allow proof of primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will
not do so in a case of fraud. It is not open to the court to infer dishonesty from facts which have not
been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must
be some fact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be
both pleaded and proved.

This approach was said to be supported by the Code of Conduct of the English Bar133 and
reflected in the decision of the House of Lords in Medcalf v Mardell,134 the headnote to
which reads:

16-45

the Code of Conduct of the Bar did not require that counsel should, when making allegations of
fraud in pleadings and other documents, have before him 'reasonably credible material' in the form
of evidence which was admissible in court to support the allegations; but that, at the preparatory
stage, it was sufficient if the material before counsel was of such a character as to lead responsible
counsel exercising an objective professional judgment to conclude that serious allegations could
properly be based upon it.

While The Law Society of Jersey's Code of Conduct had no equivalent of paragraph 704 the
Court took the view that no Jersey advocate could have drafted an Order of Justice alleging dishonest assistance unless and until he had had a sight of reasonably credible material
establishing a prima facie case of fraud. It follows that even where there is a suspicion of
fraud, a plaintiff will be under an empêchement where the claim requires an allegation of
fraud or dishonesty on the part of the defendant but the plaintiff is not in possession of
facts sufficient to safely plead fraud, ie within the parameters laid down in Three Rivers.135

16-46

b. Empêchement de fait and Article 57(3B) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
It is to be noted that while time does not begin to run against claims falling outside Article
57(1) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 that are brought by beneficiaries or enforcers against
trustees while the plaintiff remains empêche,136 where a claim is brought by trustee against
a co-trustee or former trustee, the express wording of the statute appears not to afford a
plaintiff trustee any such protection. What, if anything, turns on the omission of an equivalent to Article 57(2)(a)-(b) from Article 57(3A)? Read literally, the three-year prescription
period appears to be absolute and begins to run from the date of the trustee's appointment
irrespective of the trustee's state of knowledge, whether it has been provided with accounts
or whether the trustee was empêche for some other reason.
The Royal Court has considered the relationship between empêchement and Article 57(3B)
in the context of an application to amend pleadings. In Walker & Delarose Trustee Limited
v Egerton-Vernon & Ors,137 it was accepted by all parties, and the Court proceeded on the
basis, that it was at least arguable that the doctrine of empêchement de fait was capable of

133 Para 704: 'A barrister must not … draft any statement of case, witness statement, affidavit, notice of appeal
or other document containing: […] (c) any allegation of fraud unless he has clear instructions to make such allegation and has before him reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud'.

applying to claims subject to Article 57(3B)138 even though on the facts in that case the
trustee's argument on empêchement failed. In Walker, the plaintiff beneficiaries brought
proceedings against the first three defendants for breach of trust. The first defendant (Egerton-Vernon) had been a trustee of the settlement from 1987 to 2009; the second defendant
(Walker Representatives Ltd, 'Walker') had been a trustee from 1997 to December 2012; and
the third defendant (Chown) had been a trustee from 2001 to 2007. Walker had been incorporated by the fourth defendant (Hawksford Trust Company Jersey Ltd, 'Hawksford'), a
trust company of which Egerton-Vernon was also an employee. Egerton-Vernon and Chown
were directors of Walker. Delarose Trustee Limited (Delarose) had been incorporated in
December 2012 and appointed trustee. It had been joined to the proceedings brought by
the plaintiff beneficiaries against the first to third defendants by consent in 2013 but only in
respect of claims against Hawksford. Delarose applied for leave to re-re-amend the Order
of Justice so as to allow it to make claims against the first, second and third defendants,
the claims already made against them by the other plaintiffs. Egerton-Vernon and Chown
opposed the application, on the basis that it was prescribed under Article 57(3B). Delarose
sought to rely on the doctrine of empêchement d'agir, which it claimed had accrued to the
'office of the trustee' prior to its own incorporation in December 2012.
Delarose's application was allowed as against Walker but not as against Egerton-Vernon and
Chown. Delarose's claims against them were subject to the three-year prescription period
in Article 57(3B) and were therefore prescribed. While both Egerton-Vernon and Chown
accepted that it was at least arguable that the doctrine of empêchement could apply to trust
claims such as those which Delarose wished to make, Delarose could not, on the facts, rely
on the doctrine of empêchement d'agir to defeat Egerton-Vernon's and Chown's prescription defence. Delarose had not been incorporated until December 2012, was therefore incapable of being empêche prior its own existence, by which time the prescription period had
expired in respect of both Egerton-Vernon and Chown. It was not arguable that the 'office
of the trustee' of the settlement had been empêche, and so the benefit of such empêchement
did not accrue for the benefit of Delarose once incorporated and appointed as trustee.
It should also be noted that the Jersey Law Commission, in its 2008 consultation paper on
prescription,139 suggested that the result of the difference in drafting in Article 57 was that
the doctrine of empêchement d'agir did not apply to claims for breach of trust by beneficiaries (owing to the provisions concerning knowledge and the provision of accounts) but
might apply to claims for breach of trust other than by a beneficiary (ie a trustee), where the
provisions as to when time would begin to run were not set out with such particularity on
the basis that the 1984 Law was not to be construed as a codifying statute140 and as such the
principle of empêchement d'agir could still have an application. Indeed, the Commission
was of the view that empêchement could, on the right facts, also apply to claims brought by
beneficiaries notwithstanding Article 57(2)(a)-(b).141

Extension and Postponement

621

While there is no authority directly on point, the authors consider there to be an argument
that notwithstanding that Article 57(3B) does not expressly provide that time will begin to
run until either the earlier of knowledge or the provision of accounts (which are not the
only basis for there being a practical impediment in bringing a claim) equally Article 57(3B)
does not expressly preclude the possibility of empêchement applying to a claim for breach
of trust brought by trustees against a former or co-trustee. The decision in Walker leaves
open the possibility of an empêchement, and the case is only authority for the proposition
that a newly appointed trustee could not be said to be practically impeded from bringing
a claim prior to the start of its own existence. Where, for example, a former or co-trustee
has concealed a breach of trust so well as to ensure it remains undiscovered by an incoming
trustee for more than three years, it would seem an unjust result, in the absence of any negligence on the part of the incoming trustee, to effectively reward such a defaulting trustee
with a prescription defence. However, as was made clear in Walker, for empêchement to be
engaged, it must be practically impossible to take action. If other remedies are available (in
the hands of the beneficiaries) then that will tend to exclude the rationale for an empêchement affecting the trustee. In Walker, the plaintiff beneficiaries, or a trust company engaged
by them, could have brought proceedings seeking the dismissal of the second defendant
and the appointment of a new trustee with a view to bringing proceedings against the first
and/or third defendants within the prescription period. It does not amount to a practical
impossibility, which is the threshold to establish an empêchement, if the beneficiaries chose
not to do until it is too late.

iii. The Longstop-Article 57(3C) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984
The doctrine of empêchement de fait operates to postpone the commencement of the prescription period while the empêchement remains operative and the plaintiff remains practically impeded from bringing a claim. At customary law, there is no temporal limit to the
application of the doctrine with the potential for the plaintiff to remain empêche indefinitely. The Trusts (Amendment No 5) (Jersey) Law 2012 introduced what amounts to a
temporal limit on the doctrine of empêchement de fait. Where a claim for breach of trust
does not fall within Article 57(1) and subject to the provisions in Article 57(3), a beneficiary's claim against their trustee will be prescribed, irrespective of the operation of any
empêchement de fait, after 21 years from the breach. For example, a person born into a class
of beneficiaries, with locus to bring a claim for breach of trust who is born on the same day
on which their trustee commits a negligent breach of trust and who remains ignorant of
that breach of trust is potentially at liberty to bring a claim at any point within the next 39
years.142 It has been held, albeit obiter, that a fiduciary, such as a company director, who is
not an express trustee but falls to be treated as one for the purposes of liability, is also to
be treated as one for the purposes of prescription, including (where the breach of fiduciary duty is not fraudulent or dishonest) the application of Article 57(3C).143 The longstop
is only applicable to claims against 'category 1' express trustees and has no application to

claims against dishonest assistants or knowing recipients, who are not trustees for the purposes of the 1984 Law.144

C. Suspension of Prescription by Service of Proceedings
16-53

Effective service of originating process either within the jurisdiction or outside the jurisdiction (when leave is given to serve out) will suspend prescription from running.145 While
an application for leave is still to be determined, prescription will continue to run. Where
the plaintiff fails to table his action it is deemed discontinued, prescription will begin to
run again, and the plaintiff will have to serve a fresh form of originating process.146 It is
to be remembered that it is the actual point at which proceedings are served on the prospective defendant that prescription is halted. Where service depends upon the Viscount,
prescription does not cease upon the Viscount's receipt of the proceedings that are required
to be served.147 Where a prescription deadline is imminent this should be notified to the
Viscount in advance. The making of an application for substituted service will suspend prescription from running.148 However, the Court is not permitted to order substituted service
merely to defeat the imminent operation of prescription and may only consider those matters which are relevant to determining whether 'it is impracticable for any reason' to serve
the documents personally on any person. Such matters include, eg whether that person's
address is known, whether the documents can be served at his premises and whether they
are likely to come to his notice.149

D. Extension of the Prescription Period-Stand-still Agreements
16-54

While it appears to be possible for the parties to agree to extend or waive the three-year
prescription period, such an agreement must be clear and unambiguous in its terms that
that is in fact what has been agreed. Jersey does recognise the principle that a defendant may
be estopped from pleading limitation as a defence in circumstances where he has given an
undertaking to the plaintiff to so do in without prejudice negotiations (and not withdrawn
such an undertaking with reasonable notice). However, care should be taken as regards the
premises upon which such an undertaking is given. In Racz v Perrier & Labesse,150 the plaintiff alleged professional negligence against the defendant. The prescription period expired
on 31 May 1978. The parties began negotiations by correspondence, during which the

147 However, an empêchement de fait may arise in circumstances where the Viscount has been warned of an
impending prescription date and the Viscount's department fails to serve the proceedings prior to its expiration.
As personal service is required, within Jersey, to be effected by the Viscount, the plaintiff is practically impeded
from ensuring service is effected any more quickly.

defendant indicated that it would not plead any point of prescription prior to 30 September
1978. The negotiations broke down during May and the plaintiff served its Order of Justice
but omitted to table the action which resulted in the action being discontinued. Prescription had expired by the time fresh proceedings would have been brought. The Court determined that the defendant's undertaking was premised on negotiations proceeding beyond
the end of May which did not occur.

VI. Prescription Periods in Miscellaneous Claims
A. Claims against Directors
Any proper consideration of prescription in Jersey trust litigation should include claims
against company directors. Owing to the complexity of many modern trust structures and
with long-established authority supporting the proposition that beneficiaries, generally,
have no direct cause of action against the directors of a corporate trustee (or any company
whose shares are held as assets of a trustee),151 it is not uncommon for claims to combine
actions based upon trust law principles as well as claims existing at the corporate level.152
The appropriate prescription period applicable to claims against directors has vexed the
Jersey Royal Court for some time and the present state of the law is unsatisfactory in terms
of its certainty but also its coherence with the regime applicable to breach of trust claims
discussed above. The source of the difficulty appears to be attributable to the composite
nature of directors' duties,153 the wildly disparate prescription periods applying to conceptually distinct but superficially similar personal causes of action154 and a number of court
decisions where the point has not been definitively determined but has been given obiter
consideration.155
In Esteem, it was held that the 10-year prescription period referred to by Le Geyt156 was
a general default prescription period at customary law which should be taken to apply to
all personal actions and all actions concerning movables, save to the extent that they have
already been held to be subject to a different period, either at customary law or by statute,

151 Alhamrani v Alhamrani (n 2). We have discussed the difficulties of so-called 'dog-leg' claim in Jersey in
Ch 12. Article 56 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 was repealed by the Trusts (Amendment No 4) (Jersey) Law 2006.
152 Claims in knowing receipt and dishonest assistance can arise from a breach of fiduciary duty other than a
breach of trust; eg, primary liability may arise from a breach of a director's duties. The parameters of the doctrine
of reflective loss in Jersey is uncertain; see Freeman v Ansbacher Trustees (Jersey) Ltd (n 16).
153 Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, Art 47.
154 Not ameliorated by piecemeal statutory interventions such as Article 57 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 creating self-contained statutory 'islands' in a sea of otherwise uncodified customary law principles applicable to the
broadly defined 'actions personnelles mobiliere': 'It is hard to find a consistent theme or principle which underlies
the various prescriptive periods. But where there is no precedent, it is helpful to have regard to the nature of the
action'; In re Esteem Settlement (n 22), per Bird DB at 252 and 257; however, such an approach would, on a basic
dispute concerning a breach of an implied term of care and skill in a contract, yields the possibility of a 3-year
period (tort) or a 10-year period (contract) on what is essentially the same factual matrix.

Prescription of Actions

or that some other period is, by analogy, clearly more applicable.157 A claim against a company director in Jersey law is an action action personelle mobilière.158 The presumption in
respect of claims against directors then is that a 10-year prescription period is the starting
point, unless some other period is by analogy clearly more applicable.159 It has been held
that where a director fraudulently appropriates company property to himself, the property
is fixed with a constructive trust in favour of the company that is entitled to trace funds to
recover its proprietary interest in the misappropriated property.160 Such a proprietary claim
is not subject to the prescription period applicable to personal actions against a director.
The prescription period for personal claims against directors of a company for breach of
their fiduciary duties is not provided for under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 or the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984. The directors of a Jersey company owe the following duties:
74 Duties of directors
(1) A director, in exercising the director's powers and discharging the director's duties, shall-
(a) act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company; and
(b) exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances.

16-57

16-58

While the relationship between a director and his company is recognised as a fiduciary
relationship (and therefore superficially being analogous with the duties of trustees),161
the expression 'fiduciary duty' is properly confined only to those duties which are peculiar to fiduciaries and the breach of which attracts legal consequences differing from those
consequent upon the breach of other duties.162 Only Article 74(1)(a) of the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991 encompasses the director's fiduciary duties to the company. Put another
way, while a director has fiduciary duties, not all the duties of a director are of a fiduciary
character. The duty of a director under Article 74(1)(b) is to use proper skill and care in
the discharge of his office. This is not a fiduciary duty and is more akin to a common law
or tortious duty of care.163 By statute, the prescription period applicable to tortious claims,
including claims for breach of a duty of care and skill (ie negligence), is three years.164 While
a trustee's duties, like a director's, also include both fiduciary and non-fiduciary duties,165
the distinction is not relevant for the purposes of prescription because the period for all
claims against a trustee for breach of those duties is three years.
There is a collection of leading decisions on the principles governing prescription and
directors' duties. Unfortunately two of the decisions seem actually to talk past one another
in that Alhamrani166 provides an answer to the question that was not in issue on the facts

of the case: what prescription period applies to a breach of fiduciary duty; whereas Northwinds167 provides an answer to the question of what prescription period applies to a breach
of the duty of care and skill but concludes at a prescription period that is inconsistent with
the statutory prescription period applying to tort claims.
Alhamrani was concerned with a breach of director's duty care, diligence and skill under
Article 74(1)(b). The directors' fiduciary duties to act honestly and in good faith with a view
to the best interests of the company under Article 74(1)(a) were not in issue. Northwinds
Yachts concerned an allegation based upon a breach of loyalty that was held to be axiomatic
with the duties of a fiduciary.168 The Court held that the prescription period applying to a
breach of trust by a trustee could not be lifted either directly or by analogy from Article 57
to apply to a breach of a director's fiduciary duty. The Court in Northwinds Yachts appeared
mindful that were it to hold prescription to be analogous to Article 57 that would give rise
to practical difficulties if the director owed contractual duties,169 for which the prevailing
prescription period is 10 years.170 No consideration appears to have been given to making
an analogy with the directors' tortious duties of care. However, the Court concluded the
point was arguable and its comments in respect of prescription are acknowledged to have
been obiter as the case was disposed of on an alternative basis to the breach of duty claims.
The Royal Court in Alhamrani171 rejected the submission that the prescription period for
actions based upon breach of a directors' statutory duty of care, diligence and skill was three
years and concluded (obiter) that claims for breach of directors' duty, whether fiduciary (in
the Mothew172 sense) or of care and skill, were probably prescribed after 10 years. This was
on the basis that 10 years was the default prescription period for all personal actions (which
included breaches of fiduciary duty) under Jersey customary law.173 In the earlier decision
of Northwinds, the Royal Court had rejected a submission that a director's duty of care, diligence and skill was a fiduciary duty in the special sense described in Mothew and therefore
Article 57 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (prescribing three years) was not analogous. On
the basis that no other prescription period could be applied for breach of fiduciary duty by
analogy, the issue fell to be determined in accordance with the default period identified in
Esteem.174 However, the decision in Alhamrani in respect of prescription is also expressly
obiter. As Alhamrani is the later decision, it is often cited as the leading authority for the
proposition that breaches of a directors' duties are prescribed after 10 years.
However, it has since been held by the Master that a claim for breach of duty by a director,
which was identified as a breach of fiduciary duty in the special sense, as a ground for alleging an assumption of responsibility for the purposes of a negligent misstatement claim,
was analogous to a breach of tortious duty of care, with the applicable prescription period

therefore being three years.175 Having made a ready distinction between a director's tortious duties and fiduciary duties, the decision in Ching further salami slices the duties of a
director whereby some breaches of fiduciary duty fall to be considered as tortious.
An alternative way to consider a breach of directors' duties, having regard to the provenance of French customary law in Jersey's law of obligations, is as a species of délit, which
in French law is similar to the common law concept of a tort though differing from an
English tort in many substantive ways. Délit also has a different meaning in Jersey from the
term in modern French law.176 It has been held that, any civil action in Jersey, other than in
contract and property, in which liability arose from a wrong committed by a person against
whom relief was sought, was to be regarded as action founded on tort.177 While the Royal
Court and Court of Appeal has indicated that it is unsafe to assume that English tort law
can be imported and applied wholesale into Jersey law,178 if a breach of directors' duty is
to be regarded as a species of tort, then it will be subject to a statutory prescription period
of three years from the date of loss, subject to an empêchement.179 If the quest is for some
consistency between trustees and directors (which are the archetypal examples of fiduciaries in Jersey law), the result is not wildly different from the position that applies to trustees under Article 57(2) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 where the statutory prescription
period is three years subject to a later date of knowledge or the production of the final trust
accounts. What then where the breach of directors' duty is fraudulent? In respect of a fraudulent breach of trust, Article 57(1) ensures the cause of action is imprescriptible. However,
despite earlier authority to the contrary,180 the Jersey Law Commission has suggested that
fraud per se does not stop time from running unless it also results in an empêchement de
fait.181 If a fraudulent breach of directors' duty is only imprescriptible for fraud where the
fraud is operative so as to result in a practical impediment to bringing a claim (such as
concealment) then there is an inconsistency with the position of trustees that is not easy to
justify as a matter of basic principle.
In the absence of a statutory regime rationalising the prescription period applicable to
breaches of directors' duties, Jersey law currently appears to allow for different prescription periods depending on the nature of the particular duty breached. Where the duty that
has been breached is for want of proper care and skill, the most appropriate prescription
period is that for tortious claims, for which the applicable limitation period is three years.182
However, that is as the result of specific statutory intervention which the Court has held
could not be read across as applying by analogy to breaches of fiduciary duty by a director
because of the particular definition of various terms in the 1984 Law.183 Where a director
has breached his fiduciary duties the prescription period appears to be that applicable to

any other action personelle mobilière, namely 10 years. However, 10 years has been settled
on because at the time of Northwind Yachts, there was no analogous prescription period
and so there is currently no reliable, properly rationalised statement as to what prescription period applies to a claim against a director for breach of fiduciary duty. It has recently
been held that claims against a company director for breach of fiduciary duty are analogous
to claims against an express trustee for breach of trust not falling within Article 57(1) of
the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 and are therefore subject to the longstop limitation period in
Article 57(3C) of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984.184 This is certainly consistent with the earlier
decision in Bagus Invs Ltd v Kastening,185 which appears to supersede Northwind Yachts as
to whether the term 'trustee' in Article 57(1) could be used consistent to cover all category
1 trustees (including company directors).
At the time of going to press, the latest word from Jersey on this issue is that of Master
Thompson in CMC Holdings Ltd & Anor v RBC Trust Company (International) Limited
& Ors.186 In the course of a judgment on whether a preliminary issue should be heard on
questions of limitation, the Master considered some of the arguments which it was contended should be decided at such a hearing. The plaintiffs were Kenyan companies of which
the first defendant had been a director. It was alleged that he had breached his fiduciary
duties to the companies, causing loss to the companies, by participating in a fraudulent
scheme going back to the 1970s to divert monies from the companies to bank accounts in
Jersey. The claim was pleaded both as breach of fiduciary duty and as breach of trust, by
the director as constructive trustee. It was suggested on behalf of the director that claims
against him would be subject to the 21-year longstop period in Article 57(3C). The second
and third defendants, accused with dishonestly assisting in such breaches, contended that
they should be in a better position than the first defendant from a limitation standpoint.
The Master adopted the approach that a claim against a company director for breach of
fiduciary duty is a claim against a 'category 1' constructive trustee187 and that therefore,
as a matter of Jersey law, the provisions of Article 57 apply. The Court concluded that the
claims against the director were imprescriptible, as they alleged fraud; and that the claims
against the alleged dishonest assisters were prescribed after three years from the date when
the plaintiffs had sufficient information for it to be proper to plead the dishonesty claim,
following Nolan v Minerva. The Court rejected the suggestion that there was a distinction
between dishonesty and fraud for the purposes of Article 57(1).
This conclusion is obiter. The Court was not required to reach a concluded view on these
matters in deciding whether or not to order the trial of a preliminary issue. Yet it is the
first time that the Royal Court has expressly applied the Peconic treatment of fiduciaries as
trustees to Article 57 of the Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984, so as to conclude that the limitation

period for breach of fiduciary duty claims against company directors and other 'category 1'
constructive trustees is governed by Article 57 rather than by the customary law.
In the theoretically conceivable situation in which the fiduciary was not said to be dishonest but those who assisted him were, both would be able to rely on a three-year period
but slightly different approaches would probably be taken to the impact of the plaintiffs'
knowledge, as the fiduciary would be able to rely on Article 57(2)(b) which refers purely
to date of knowledge, while the dishonest assistants could rely on customary law empêchement which is arguably less favourable to plaintiffs as it imposes an objective test as to the
inquiries the plaintiffs should reasonably have made in order to gain sufficient knowledge
to bring a claim. Thus the assisters may still be in a slightly better position than the trustee,
even though they are accused of dishonesty and the trustee/fiduciary is not.
In the authors' view the conclusion reached by the Royal Court in Alhamrani that breaches
of directors' duty, whatever their character, are prescribed after 10 years, cannot safely be
regarded as a definitive statement of the law. The position is likely to be more nuanced.
There is recent, albeit obiter, authority that breaches of a director's duties that are nonfiduciary in character are to be regarded as analogous to a tort and prescribed at three years
and that breaches of fiduciary duty are to be regarded as analogous to the duties of at trustee and fall to be treated in an analogous fashion to a trustee under Article 57. It has been a
consistent theme in the authorities that it is undesirable for reasons of practicality, for there
to be more than one prescription period applicable to breaches of directors' duty, particularly where the two alternatives (three years or 10 years) are so far apart. Such a divergence
is recognised to have an unwelcome distorting effect on the way claims against directors are
pleaded. The clear temptation in cases where more than three years has expired since the
breach is to characterise every breach of duty of care as a breach of fiduciary duty or to cast
duties of care and skill as implied contractual terms. The current state of uncertainty in the
law, and the absence of statutory intervention, gives rise to a strong policy imperative for
the Royal Court, where it can, to revisit the statements of the law in Northwinds and Alhamrani. There is a perception that a prescription period of 10 years for breaches of directors'
duty may be too long. Putting aside the issue of a prescription period applicable to a director's breach of duty of care and skill, it is difficult to rationalise why, as a matter of principle,
breaches of a trustee's fiduciary duties should be prescribed seven years sooner than if the
same acts or omissions were committed by a director. Were the Royal Court to find that
breaches of directors' fiduciary duties are analogous with those of a trustee, as was done
in CMC Holdings, that would also align with the prevailing statutory prescription period
for breach of tortious duties of care and skill and obviate the undesirable and impractical
distortion of having divergent prescription periods. In the authors' view, the three years
applicable to breaches of a trustee's duties are clearly more analogous.

day of the gift or death of the deceased respectively.189 In exceptional circumstances this
period may be extended.190 That case predates the later authorities of Boyd and Maynard
and, in the authors' view, the test to obtain an extension of time is likely to be similar, if not
identical to that for empêchment de fait.
