specify a greater majority; or\n\n(b)\n\nif the articles specify a greater majority than two-thirds (or unanimity), that\ngreater majority (or unanimity).245\n\n(1B) Where the articles make different

special resolution is proposed, a declaration by the chairman\nthat the resolution is carried is, unless a poll is demanded, conclusive evidence of the\nfact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or\nagainst the resolution.\n\n(4)\n\nIn computing the majority on a poll demanded on the question that a special\nresolution be passed, reference is to be had to

Article 115\nand the company makes an application to the court, the court shall make an order\nthat the distribution is to be treated for all purposes as if it had been made in\naccordance with that Article if the court –\n(a)\n\nconsiders that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (2) are met; and\n\n(b)\n\ndoes not consider that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.\n\nThe conditions referred to in paragraph (1)(a) are that –\n(a)\n\nimmediately after the distribution was made the company was able to\ndischarge its liabilities as they fell due;\n\n(b)\n\nat the time when the application is determined by the court the company is\nable to discharge its liabilities as they fall due; and\n\n(c)\n\nwhere the distribution was made less than 12 months before

shares, or all the\nshares of any class or classes, in a company (other than shares which at the date of\nthe offer are already held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same\nin relation to all the shares to which the offer relates or, where those shares include\nshares of different classes, in relation to all the shares of each class.\n\n(2)\n\nIn paragraph (1) “shares” means shares (other than relevant treasury shares) that\nhave been allotted on the date of the offer.343\n\n(2A) A takeover offer may include among the shares to which it relates –\n(a)\n\nall or any shares that are allotted after the date of the offer but before a\nspecified date;\n\n(b)\n\nall or any relevant treasury shares that cease to be held as treasury shares\nbefore a specified date; and\n\n(c)\n\nall or any other relevant treasury shares.344\n\n(2B) In this Article –\n“relevant treasury shares” means shares which –\n(a)\n\nare held by the company as treasury shares on the date of the offer; or\n\n(b)\n\nbecome shares held by the company as treasury shares after that date but\nbefore a specified date;\n\n“specified date” means a date specified in or determined in accordance with the terms\nof the offer.345\n(2C) An offer is not prevented from being a takeover offer by reason of not being made\nto shareholders whose registered address is not in Jersey if –\n(a)\n\nthe offer was not made to those shareholders in order not to contravene the\nlaw of a country or territory outside Jersey; and\n\n(b)\n\neither –\n(i)\n\nthe offer is published in the Jersey Gazette, or\n\n(ii)\n\na document containing the terms of the offer can be inspected, or a copy\nof it obtained, at a place in Jersey or on a website, and a notice is\npublished in the Jersey Gazette specifying the address of that place or\nwebsite.346\n\n(2D) Where an offer is made to acquire shares in a company and there are persons for\nwhom, by reason of the law of a country or territory outside Jersey, it is impossible\nto accept the offer, or more difficult to do so, that does not prevent the offer from\nbeing a takeover offer.347\n(2E) It is not to be inferred –\n(a)\n\nthat an offer which is not made to every holder of shares, or every holder of\nshares of any class or classes, in the company cannot be a takeover offer unless\nthe requirements of paragraph (2C) are met; or\nOfficial Consolidated Version\n27 February 2024 – Current\n\nPage - 121\n\n\fCompanies (Jersey) Law 1991\n\n(b)\n\nArticle 117\n\nthat an offer which is impossible, or more difficult, for certain persons to\naccept cannot be a takeover offer unless the reason for the impossibility or\ndifficulty is the one mentioned in paragraph (2D).348\n\n(3)\n\nThe terms offered in relation to any shares shall for the purposes of this Article be\ntreated as being the same in relation to all the shares or, as the case may be, all the\nshares of a class to which the offer relates notwithstanding any variation permitted\nby paragraph (4).\n\n(4)\n\nA variation is permitted by this paragraph where –\n(a)\n\nthe law of a country or territory outside Jersey precludes the acceptance of an\noffer in the form or any of the forms specified or precludes it except after\ncompliance by the offeror with conditions with which the offeror is unable to\ncomply or which the offeror regards as unduly onerous; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe variation is such that the persons by whom the acceptance of an offer in\nthat form is precluded are able to accept an offer otherwise than in that form\nbut of substantially equivalent value.\n\n(5)\n\nThe reference in paragraph (1) to shares already held by the offeror includes a\nreference to shares which the offeror has contracted to acquire but that shall not be\nconstrued as including shares which are the subject of a contract binding the holder\nto accept the offer when it is made, being a contract entered into by the holder for\nnothing other than a promise by the offeror to make the offer.349\n\n(6)\n\nWhere the terms of an offer make provision for their revision and for acceptances on\nthe previous terms to be treated as acceptances on the revised terms, the revision\nshall not be regarded for the purposes of this Part as the making of a fresh offer and\nreferences in this Part to the date of the offer shall accordingly be construed as\nreferences to the date on which the original offer was made.\n\n(7)\n\nIn this Part the “offeror” means, subject to Article 122, the person making a takeover\noffer and the “company” means the company whose shares are the subject of the\noffer.\n\n117 Right of offeror to buy out minority shareholders\n(1)\n\nIf, in a case in which a takeover offer does not relate to shares of different classes,\nthe offeror has by virtue of acceptances of the offer acquired or contracted to\nacquire –\n(a)\n\nin the case of a par value company, not less than 9/10ths in nominal value of\nthe shares to which the offer relates; or\n\n(b)\n\nin the case of a no par value company, not less than 9/10ths in number of the\nshares to which the offer relates,\n\nthe offeror may give notice, to the holder of any shares to which the offer relates\nwhich the offeror has not acquired or contracted to acquire, that he or she desires to\nacquire those shares.350\n(2)\n\nIf, in a case in which a takeover offer relates to shares of different classes, the offeror\nhas by virtue of acceptances of the offer acquired or contracted to acquire –\n(a)\n\nin the case of a par value company, not less than 9/10ths in nominal value of\nthe shares of any class to which the offer relates; or\n\nOfficial Consolidated Version\n27 February 2024 – Current\n\nPage - 122\n\n\fCompanies (Jersey) Law 1991\n\n(b)\n\nArticle 118\n\nin the case of a no par value company, not less than 9/10ths in number of the\nshares of any class to which the offer relates,\n\nthe offeror may give notice, to the holder of any shares of that class which the offeror\nhas not acquired or contracted to acquire, that he or she desires to acquire those\nshares.351\n(3)\n\nNo notice shall be given under paragraph (1) or (2) unless the offeror has acquired\nor contracted to acquire the shares necessary to satisfy the minimum specified in that\nparagraph before the end of the period of 4 months beginning with the date of the\noffer; and no such notice shall be given after the end of the period of 2 months\nbeginning with the date on which the offeror has acquired or contracted to acquire\nshares which satisfy that minimum.\n\n(4)\n\nWhen the offeror gives the first notice in relation to an offer he or she shall send a\ncopy of it to the company together with a declaration by the offeror that the\nconditions for the giving of the notice are satisfied.\n\n(5)\n\nWhere the offeror is a body corporate (whether or not a company within the meaning\nof this Law) the declaration shall be signed by a director.\n\n(6)\n\nAny person who fails to send a copy of a notice or a declaration as required by\nparagraph (4) or makes such a declaration for the purposes of that paragraph\nknowing it to be false or without having reasonable grounds for believing it to be\ntrue is guilty of an offence.\n\n(7)\n\nIf a person is charged with any offence for failing to send a copy of a notice as\nrequired by paragraph (4) it is a defence for the person to prove that the person took\nreasonable steps for securing compliance with that paragraph.\n\n(8)\n\nWhere during the period within which a takeover offer can be accepted the offeror\nacquires or contracts to acquire any of the shares to which the offer relates but\notherwise than by virtue of acceptances of the offer, then if –\n(a)\n\nthe value of that for which they are acquired or contracted to be acquired (the\n“acquisition value”) does not at that time exceed the value of that which is\nreceivable by an acceptor under the terms of the offer; or\n\n(b)\n\nthose terms are subsequently revised so that when the revision is announced\nthe acquisition value, at the time mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), no longer\nexceeds the value of that which is receivable by an acceptor under those terms,\n\nthe offeror shall be treated for the purposes of this Article as having acquired or\ncontracted to acquire those shares by virtue of acceptances of the offer; but in any\nother case those shares shall be treated as excluded from those to which the offer\nrelates.\n\n118 Effect of notice under Article 117\n(1)\n\nThe following provisions shall, subject to Article 121, have effect where a notice is\ngiven in respect of any shares under Article 117.\n\n(2)\n\nThe offeror shall be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms of the\noffer.\n\n(3)\n\nWhere the terms of an offer are such as to give the holder of any shares a choice of\npayment for the holder’s shares the notice shall give particulars of the choice and\nstate –\n\nOfficial Consolidated Version\n27 February 2024 – Current\n\nPage - 123\n\n\fCompanies (Jersey) Law 1991\n\nArticle 118\n\n(a)\n\nthat the holder of the shares may within 6 weeks from

taken as applying in default of\nthe holder indicating a choice as aforesaid,\n\nand the terms of the offer mentioned in paragraph (2) shall be determined\naccordingly.\n(4)\n\nParagraph (3) applies whether or not any time limit or other conditions applicable to\nthe choice under the terms of the offer can still be complied with; and if the payment\nchosen by the holder of the shares –\n(a)\n\nis not cash and the offeror is no longer able to make that payment; or\n\n(b)\n\nwas to have been made by a third party who is no longer bound or able to\nmake that payment,\n\nthe payment shall be taken to consist of an amount of cash payable by the offeror\nwhich at the date of the notice is equivalent to the chosen payment.\n(5)\n\nAt the end of 6 weeks from the date of the notice the offeror shall forthwith–\n(a)\n\nsend a copy of the notice to the company; and\n\n(b)\n\nmake payment to the company for the shares to which the notice relates.\n\n(6)\n\nThe copy of the notice sent to the company under paragraph (5)(a) shall be\naccompanied by an instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the shareholder by\na person appointed by the offeror; and on receipt of that instrument the company\nshall register the offeror as the holder of those shares.\n\n(7)\n\nWhere the payment referred to in paragraph (5)(b) is to be made in shares or\nsecurities to be allotted by the offeror the reference in that paragraph to the making\nof payment shall be construed as a reference to the allotment of the shares or\nsecurities to the company.\n\n(8)\n\nAny sum received by a company under paragraph (5)(b) and any other payment\nreceived under that paragraph shall be held by the company on trust for the person\nentitled to the shares in respect of which the sum or other payment was

other payment was received or\nthe company is wound up, the sum or other payment (together with any interest,\ndividend or other benefit that has accrued from it) shall be paid to the Viscount.\n(11)

direction given to the person under paragraph (1), or a refusal to grant an application under paragraph (6), or the granting of such an application only in part, may appeal to the Court.\n(9)     Such

all the circumstances of the case.\n(10)    A person’s appeal under paragraph (8) shall be lodged with the Court no later than the day that is one month after the day on which notice was served on the person of the direction, refusal or grant (as the case requires).\n(11)    On the appeal, the Court may make such interim or final order as it thinks fit.\n(12)    If a direction makes a requirement

enter into agreements for services provided by the relevant person in carrying on trust company business;\n(c)     persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided, or arranged, by

term of imprisonment for 2 years and a fine.\n(16)    The record of the conviction of any person for an offence under paragraph (15) or (15A) shall be admissible in any civil proceedings as evidence of the facts constituting the offence.\n\n24      Injunctions and remedial Orders\n\n(1)     Where, on the application of the Commission, the Court is satisfied that it is likely that a person will contravene (or continue or repeat a contravention of) –\n(a)     Article 7(1);\n(b)     any condition prescribed or attached under Article 10;\n(c)     any provision of Article 28, 31, 39G or 39L;\n(d)     any direction given under Article 23; or\n(e)     any Regulation or Order made under this Law,\nthe Court may if it thinks fit issue an injunction restraining that person from committing (or, as the case may be, continuing or repeating) the contravention.\n(2)     Where, on the application of the Commission, the Court is satisfied that any person has committed a contravention of a type referred to in paragraph (1)(a) to (e), and that there are steps which could be taken to remedy the contravention, the Court may make an order requiring that person, or any other person who appears to the Court to have been knowingly concerned, to take such steps as the Court may direct to remedy the contravention.\n\n25      Public statements\n\nThe Commission may issue –\n(a)     a public statement with respect to, or setting out, any direction that the Commission has given under Article 16 or 23;\n(b)     a public statement concerning a person if that person appears to the Commission to have contravened a Code of Practice;\n(ba)    a public statement with respect to the serving of a final notice on a registered person, or a person who is or was a principal person of a registered person, under Article 21C(3) of the Financial Services Commission (Jersey) Law 1998 imposing a penalty following the contravention of a Code of Practice by that registered person;\n(c)     a public statement concerning a person if that person appears to the Commission to have committed a contravention of any of the provisions referred to in Article 24(1)(a) to (e); or\n(d)     a public statement concerning a person if it appears to the Commission that the person carried on or is carrying on financial service business (whether or not the person is or was a registered person at the time of carrying on that business and whether the business is or was carried on in Jersey or in a country or territory outside Jersey), and it appears to the Commission to be desirable to issue the statement in the best interests of –\n(i)      persons who transacted or may transact financial service business (other than trust company business) with the person,\n(ii)     persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services provided by the person in carrying on trust company business,\n(iii)     persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided, or arranged, by the person in carrying on trust company business, or\n(iv)    the public.\n\n25A   Notice of public statement\n\n(1)     If a public statement identifies any person who is registered, the Commission shall serve notice on the person.\n(2)     If a public statement identifies any person who is not registered, and at any time before the Commission issues the public statement it is reasonably practicable for the Commission to serve notice on the person, the Commission shall do so.\n(3)     A notice under paragraph (1) or (2) shall –\n(a)     give the reasons for issuing the statement;\n(b)     give the proposed or actual date of issue of the statement;\n(c)     contain a copy of the statement;\n(d)     give particulars of the right of appeal under Article 25C in respect of the statement; and\n(e)     if the statement is issued, in accordance with a decision under Article 25B(3), before the day specified in Article 25B(1) in relation to the statement, give the reasons for issuing it before that day.\n(4)     Paragraph (3) shall not require the Commission –\n(a)     to specify any reason that would in the Commission’s opinion involve the disclosure of confidential information the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to a third party; or\n(b)     to specify the same reasons, or reasons in the same manner, in the case of notices to different persons about the same matter.\n(5)     In this Article and Articles 25B and 25C, a reference to the identification of a person in a public statement does not include the identification, in the statement, of the Commission or of any other person in their capacity of exercising functions under this Law.\n\n25B   Notice period\n(1)     If service is required under Article 25A(1) or (2) in relation to a public statement, the Commission shall not issue the public statement earlier than the expiration of one month from the date of the last such service in relation to the public statement.\n(2)     Paragraph (1) shall not apply if –\n(a)     each of the persons identified (within the meaning of Article 25A) in the relevant public statement agrees with the Commission that the statement may be issued on a date earlier than the date that would apply under that paragraph; and\n(b)     the statement is in fact issued on or after the earlier date.\n(3)     Paragraph (1) shall not apply if –\n(a)     the Commission decides on reasonable grounds that the interests of –\n(i)      persons who transacted or may transact financial service business (other than trust company business) with any person identified (within the meaning of Article 25A) in the relevant public statement,\n(ii)      persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services provided by any person (being a person so identified) in carrying on trust company business,\n(iii)     persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided, or arranged, by any person (being a person so identified) in carrying on trust company business, or\n(iv)     the public,\nin the issue of the relevant public statement on a date earlier than the date that would apply under that paragraph outweigh the detriment to the persons identified in the statement, being the detriment attributable to that earliness; and\n(b)     the statement is in fact issued on or after the earlier date.[103]\n(4)     In making a decision under paragraph (3), the Commission is not prevented from choosing as the date of issue of a public statement the date of service (if any) of notice of the statement.\n(5)     Despite this Article, if an appeal is made to the Court under Article 25C(1), and the Court orders that the statement not be issued before any specified date or event, the Commission shall not issue the statement before the date or event so specified.\n(6)     In a case to which paragraph (1) applies, if an appeal is made under Article 25C(2) to the Court against a decision to issue a public statement, the Commission shall not issue the statement before the day on which that appeal is determined by the Court or withdrawn.\n\n25C    Appeals about public statements\n\n(1)     A person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission under Article 25B(3) may appeal to the Court, in accordance with this Article, against the decision.\n(2)     A person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission to issue a public statement that identifies the person may appeal to the Court, in accordance with this Article, against the decision.\n(3)     An appeal under paragraph (2) may be made only on the ground that the decision of the Commission was unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\n(4)     A person’s appeal under this Article shall be lodged with the Court no later than –\n(a)     if notice is served on the person under Article 25A in relation to the public statement, the day that is one month after the date of the last such service on the person in relation to the public statement; or\n(b)     if no such notice is served on the person, the day that is one month after the issue of the public statement.\n(5)     Nothing in paragraph (4) prevents the lodging of an appeal before a notice is served or a public statement is issued.\n(6)     On an appeal under this Article, the Court may make such interim or final order as it thinks fit, including an order that the Commission not issue the relevant public statement or, if the public statement has been issued, that the Commission issue a further public statement to the effect set out in the order or stop making the statement available to the public.\n\n26      Powers of intervention\n\n(1)     Where, on the application of the Commission, the Court is satisfied that –\n(a)     a registered person –\n(i)      is not in terms of Article 9(3)(a) a fit and proper person to carry on financial service business that the registered person is purporting to carry on,\n(ii)      is not fit to carry on financial service business to the extent to which the registered person is purporting to do, or\n(iii)     has committed or is likely to commit a contravention of a type referred to in Article 24(1); and\n(b)     it is desirable for the Court to act under this paragraph for the protection of –\n(i)      persons who transacted or may transact financial service business (other than trust company business) with the registered person,\n(ii)      persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services provided by the registered person in carrying on trust company business, or\n(iii)     persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided, or arranged, by the registered person in carrying on trust company business,\nthe Court may, as it thinks just, make an order making the registered person’s business subject to such supervision, restraint or conditions from such time and for such periods as the Court may specify, and may also make such ancillary orders as the Court thinks desirable.[105]\n(2)     If, on an application made under paragraph (1), the Court is satisfied that a registered person has –\n(a)     by entering into any transaction with another person, contravened Article 7;\n(b)     by entering into any transaction with another person, contravened any condition applicable to the registered person (whether attached to the registered person’s registration or prescribed by Order) or any direction given to the registered person under Article 23;\n(c)     contravened Article 39G or 39L with the result that another person has been induced to enter into a transaction with the registered person or with a third person; or\n(d)     entered into any transaction with another person who was induced to enter into the transaction as a result of the contravention of Article 39G or 39L by a third person,\nthe Court may order any one or more of those persons (and any other person who appears to the Court to have been knowingly concerned in the contravention) to take such steps as the Court may direct for restoring one or more of the persons to the position in which they were before the transaction was entered into.\n(3)     Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1) or (2), an order issued under either of those paragraphs may include a requirement that all assets, or all assets of a specified description which, at any time while the requirement is in force –\n(a)     where the registered person carries on financial service business –\n(i)      belong to the registered person concerned, or\n(ii)      belong to persons with whom the registered person is transacting financial service business and that are held by or to the registered person’s order; or\n(b)     where the registered person carries on trust company business –\n(i)      belong to the registered person concerned,\n(ii)      are held on behalf of persons who have entered into an agreement for the provision of services to be provided by the registered person when carrying on trust company business, or\n(iii)     are held on behalf of persons who have received or may receive the benefit of services provided or arranged by the registered person when carrying on trust company business,\nshall be transferred to and held by a person whose appointment is approved by the Court (in this Article referred to as an “appointed person”).\n(4)     Where a requirement of a type referred to in paragraph (3) is imposed under this Article, it shall be the duty of the registered person concerned to transfer the assets to the appointed person and to give the appointed person all such other assistance as may be required to enable the appointed person to discharge his or her functions in accordance with the requirement.\n(5)     Assets held by an appointed person in accordance with a requirement of a type referred to in paragraph (3) shall not be released or dealt with except in accordance with directions given by the Court or in such circumstances as may be specified by it.\n(6)     An order including a requirement of a type referred to in paragraph (3) may relate to assets outside Jersey.\n(7)     The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to any right of any aggrieved person to bring proceedings directly in respect of any right such person may otherwise have independently of the Commission.\n27      Compensation schemes\n(1)     The States may by Regulations establish in relation to any financial service business (other than trust company business), or to classes of such business (other than trust company business), schemes for compensation in cases where registered persons or formerly registered persons are unable, or are likely to be unable, to satisfy claims in respect of any description of civil liability incurred by them in connection with such business, and the provisions of such schemes may be different for different classes of person or for different classes of such business.\n(2)     Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), Regulations may in particular make provision –\n(a)     for levies to be imposed on registered persons for the purpose of meeting expenses incurred, or expected to be incurred, including expenses related to establishing the scheme and paying compensation;\n(b)     for the procedure to be followed in making a claim;\n(c)     for making interim payments before a claim is finally determined;\n(d)     limiting the amount payable on a claim to a specified maximum amount or a maximum amount calculated in a specified manner;\n(e)     for payment to be made, in specified circumstances, to a person other than the claimant;\n(f)      for the determination and regulation of matters relating to the scheme by any specified person;\n(g)     as to the effect of a payment of compensation under the scheme in relation to rights or obligations arising out of the claim against a registered person

person.\n\n28      False information and failure to supply information\n\n(1)     Any person who knowingly or recklessly provides the Commission or any other person entitled to information under this

under this Law or any Regulation or Order made thereunder;\n(b)     otherwise than as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) but in circumstances in which the person providing the information intends, or could reasonably be expected to know, that the information would be used by the Commission for the purpose of exercising its functions under this Law.\n(2)     Any person who knowingly or recklessly provides the Commission or any other person with information which is false or misleading in a material particular shall be guilty of an offence if the information is provided in connection with an application for registration under this Law.\n(3)     A registered person or formerly registered person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she fails to provide the Commission with any information in his or her possession, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that or being reckless as to whether –\n(a)     the information is relevant to the exercise by the Commission of its functions under this Law in relation to the registered person or formerly registered person; and\n(b)     the withholding of the information is likely to result in the Commission being misled as to any matter which is relevant to and of material significance for the exercise of those functions in relation to the registered person or formerly registered person.\n(4)     Any person who knowingly or recklessly provides any person appointed under Article 33 with information which is false or misleading in a material particular shall be guilty of an offence.\n(5)     A person guilty of an offence

provision –\n(a)     for requiring the service of notice with respect to the rights exercisable under the Regulations;\n(b)     for the restitution of property and the making or recovery of payments where those rights are exercised;\n(c)     for such other matters as are incidental to or connected with any of the above.\n30      \n31      Control of advertising\n\n(1)     The Minister may, on the recommendation of the Commission, make Orders relating to the issue, form and content of financial service advertisements.\n(2)     Orders made under this Article may make different provision for

to the matters set out in paragraph (b), to the persons by whom they are issued or otherwise);\n(b)     make provision regarding the presentation, content, accuracy, effect and implications of financial service advertisements, and ancillary matters, and may include provision regarding matters which must be, as well as matters which may not be, included in financial service advertisements;\n(c)     provide for exemptions from any prohibition or requirement imposed by the Orders, including exemptions by reference to a person’s membership of a class whose membership is determined otherwise than by the Minister or the Commission.\n(3)     Any registered person who issues or causes to be issued in Jersey or elsewhere and, subject to paragraph (4), any other person who issues or causes to be issued in Jersey, a financial service advertisement –\n(a)     the issue of which is prohibited by an Order made under this Article;\n(b)     which does not comply fully with,

shall not be guilty of an offence under this Article if the person proves that he or she received the financial service advertisement in question for publication in the ordinary course of his or her business, that the matters contained in the financial service advertisement were not, wholly or in part, devised or selected by him or her or by any person under his or her direction or control and that the person did not know and had no reason for believing that publication of the financial service advertisement would constitute an offence.\n(5)     For the purposes of this Article –\n(a)     a financial service advertisement issued or caused to be issued by any person by way of display or exhibition in a public place shall be treated as issued or caused to be issued by him or her on every day on which he or she causes or permits it to be displayed or exhibited;\n(b)     where a financial service advertisement invites the transaction of financial service business with, or the provision of services provided or arranged by a person carrying on trust company business by a person specified in the advertisement, its issue shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been caused by that person.\n(6)     For the purposes of this Article a financial service advertisement issued outside Jersey shall be treated as issued in Jersey if it is directed to persons in Jersey or is made available to them otherwise than in a newspaper, journal, magazine or other publication published and circulating principally outside Jersey or in a sound or television broadcast transmitted principally for reception outside Jersey.\n\nDIVISION 4 – INFORMATION AND INVESTIGATIONS\n\n32      General power to require information and documents\n\n(1)     The Commission, an officer or an agent

and answer such questions as the Commission, an officer or an agent reasonably requires the person to answer for the purpose of investigating the suspected contravention.\n(3)     In a case where the Commission, an officer or an agent may, by notice in writing served on a person under paragraph (1) or (2), require the person to provide information or documents, the Commission, an officer or an agent may in addition or instead require any other person (by notice in writing served on the latter person) who appears to be in possession of some or all of the information or documents to do

by notice under paragraph (1) or (2), to provide or answer (whether or not notice has in fact been served on the person under paragraph (1) or (2)); and\n(b)     in such form (if any) as the notice under this paragraph may specify.\n(7)     If, under this Article, a person provides documents in the person’s possession but claims a lien on the documents so provided, the provision of the documents

The\nregistered person must:\n\n2.6.1 Ensure any delegation is for a specific purpose;\n\n2.6.2 Where the delegation is irrevocable, include within the documentation either an\nexpiry date, or a statement that the delegation will expire given specific\ncircumstance(s) or action(s);\n\n2.6.3 Where the delegation is revocable, include within the documentation an expiry\ndate or a requirement that the relationship with the appropriate person is formally\nreviewed on a periodic basis;\n\n2.6.4 Monitor the application of the power of attorney, formal agreement or other\narrangement; and\n\n2.6.5 Ensure that appropriate due diligence has been carried out on the delegatee.\n\n2.7 A registered person must ensure that adequate procedures are implemented to ensure that\ndetailed robust reviews are conducted at appropriate intervals in respect of the trust\ncompany business services, which it provides to its customers.\n\n3 A registered person must organise and control its\naffairs effectively for the proper performance of its\nbusiness activities and be able to demonstrate the\nexistence of adequate risk management systems.\n\n3.1 Corporate governance\n\n3.1.1 A registered person must operate an effective corporate governance system that\nmust include the following key elements:\n\n3.1.1.1 Satisfy the JFSC it has an adequate regulatory span of control,\nat all times, appropriate to the nature of its business.\n\n3.1.1.2 Where a registered person is entitled to control trust company\nbusiness assets, its regulatory span of control must comprise at\nleast three appropriately skilled and experienced individuals.\n\n3.1.1.3 The relationship between the individuals must be such as to\nensure they can all exercise independent judgement without\nduress or undue influence from one another.\n\n3.1.1.4 Responsibilities must be apportioned among a registered\nperson’s directors/partners, key persons, senior managers and\nemployees in such a way that their individual responsibilities\nare clear.\n\n3.1.1.5 The business and affairs of a registered person must be\nadequately monitored and controlled at senior management\nand board level.\n\n3.1.2 Specifically with respect to 3.1.1.1:\n\n3.1.2.1 Those individuals comprising regulatory span of control must\nbe actively involved in the day-to-day management of the\nbusiness on a full time basis and be able to exercise executive\npowers on behalf of the registered person. Normally the\nindividuals will be directors of the registered person however,\nany directors that are not actively involved, “non-executives”,\nor those who are not locally based, may not form part of the\nregulatory span of control of a registered person.\n\n3.1.2.2 As soon as a registered person becomes aware that the\nregulatory span of control requirement will not be maintained\nit must notify the JFSC in writing. In this respect where a\nregistered person has the minimum individuals comprising\nregulatory span of control and one of those individuals is\nabsent from the business for a substantial period of time, the\nregistered person must contact the JFSC to discuss its proposed\narrangements such that during this period, the business is\nmanaged and controlled by an appropriate number of locally\nbased individuals.\n\n3.1.2.3 Where close family members are eligible to form part of the\nregulatory span of control only one member may be counted.\n\n3.1.3 A registered person must have documented procedures sufficient to facilitate the\neffective management of risk by the board of directors and senior management.\n\n3.1.4. All aspects of corporate governance arrangements must be subject to appropriately\nregular review to ensure their continuing adequacy in light of the registered\nperson’s business activities and risk profiles, and include a periodic self-assessment,\nor external assessment, of the board’s effectiveness.\n\nNotes:\n1. Corporate governance is the system by which an organisation is directed and\ncontrolled. A corporate governance framework specifies the distribution of rights and\nresponsibilities among different participants in the organisation and sets out the rules\nand procedures for making decisions. \n2. Risk management is an integral part of the corporate governance framework. In the context of Principle 3, “risk” refers to all the\nrisks that a registered person faces, or may face, as a business enterprise.\n\n2. Article 74(1) of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 states:\n\n“A director, in exercising the director’s powers and discharging the director’s duties,\nshall –\n\n(a) Act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company;\n\n(b) Exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would\nexercise in comparable circumstances.”\n\n3. The requirements set out under paragraph 3.1.1 deal with both financial resources\nand conduct of business issues referring as they do, to the management of the\nbusiness of the registered person itself. As such, this is not a provision that directly\ngoverns, for instance, appropriate signatory arrangements for the execution of a\nspecific transaction or exercise of a particular discretion.\n\n4. In rare circumstances, and where a registered person requires “six-eyes”, the JFSC may\npermit the inclusion of an individual who is actively involved in the day-to-day\nmanagement of the business (a senior manager) when considering regulatory span of\ncontrol. In this scenario, the JFSC will consider the fitness and propriety of the senior\nmanager using the procedure established for considering principal persons and key\npersons. For the purpose of regulatory span of control, the JFSC views the senior\nmanager as materially equivalent to a director and will hold them accountable for\ntheir actions.\n\n5.. For the purpose of 3.1.1.4, all individuals having up to date job descriptions may best\nevidence apportionment of responsibilities. However, the terms of reference relating\nto particular offices or committees, or Board resolutions, may also demonstrate\napportionment of responsibilities.\n\n6. The JFSC would expect the board of directors and/or management board of a\nregistered person to, collectively, demonstrate appropriate qualifications, experience,\ncompetency and a broad, complementary skill set relevant to the business. In this\nrespect reference to Table 4 Qualifications and Table 5 Qualifications as set out in the\nGuidance Note: Professional Qualifications (Trust Company Business) (the TCB\nprofessional qualifications guidance note) may be useful. \n\n7. For the purposes of 3.1.2.3 “close family” comprises spouses (including co-habitees),\ncivil partners, children, dependants, parents, brothers, and sisters.\n\n8. With respect to 3.1.2.2, the JFSC considers a period in excess of four weeks to\nconstitute a substantial absence from the registered person.\n\n3.2 Internal systems and controls\n\n3.2.1 A registered person must:\n\n3.2.1.1 Operate robust arrangements for meeting the standards and requirements of the regulatory framework, including:\n\n3.2.1.1.1 Maintaining, and testing adherence to, policies and procedures covering the operation of the business;\n\n3.2.1.1.2 The appointment of a Compliance Officer;\n\n3.2.1.1.3 Establishing effective complaints handling systems;\n\n3.2.1.1.4 Adequate supervision of direct and indirect employees;\n\n3.2.1.1.5 Documented systems, controls and procedures governing sole, dual or multiple authorisations for handling both the registered person’s and trust company business assets, for reconciling movements in trust company business assets, and for guarding against involvement in financial crime (including the detection and prevention of money laundering); and\n\n3.2.1.1.6 Ensuring that all transactions or decisions are appropriately authorised by persons with the requisite knowledge and experience to effect such transactions or make such decisions.\n\n3.2.1.2 Keep adequate, orderly and up-to-date records which must include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\n3.2.1.2.1 Its business transactions;\n\n3.2.1.2.2 Its financial position;\n\n3.2.1.2.3 Its internal organisation;\n\n3.2.1.2.4 Its risk management systems;\n\n3.2.1.2.5 Its board or management minutes; and\n\n3.2.1.2.6 The relationship between the legal persons/arrangements forming part of the group subject to registration under the FS(J)L.\n\n3.2.1.3 Ensure that adequate business resumption, disaster recovery and other contingency arrangements are in place and tested at appropriate intervals.\n\n3.2.1.4 Comply with all relevant anti-money laundering legislation and guidance to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The legislation must be observed in conjunction with the standards set out in the relevant AML/CFT Handbook.\n\n3.2.1.5 Have due regard to the principles of the sound business practices policyii document issued by the JFSC, irrespective of the jurisdiction in which the entity that it is providing services to was incorporated.\n\n3.2.1.6 Comply with the JFSC’s policy on outsourcing as may be updated from time to time.\n\n3.2.2 Where a registered person is providing services defined in Article 2(4)(a) of the FS(J)L (namely acting as a company formation agent, a partnership formation agent or a foundation formation agent under a registration for Class F trust company business), it must:\n\n3.2.2.1  Understand, and document, the rationale for the formation of the company, partnership or foundation (as relevant); and\n\n3.2.2.2 Comply with relevant statutory obligations arising as a result of forming companies, partnerships or foundations in Jersey and other jurisdictions. \n\n3.2.3 Where a registered person is providing services:\n\n3.2.3.1 Defined in Article 2(4)(b) of the FS(J)L (namely acting or fulfilling the function of or arranging for another person to act as or fulfil the function of director or alternate director of a company under a registration for Class G trust company business): \n \nOr\nDefined in Article 2(4)(c) of the FS(J)L (namely acting or fulfilling the function of or arranging for another person to act as or fulfil the function of a partner of a partnership under a registration for Class H trust company business): \n\nIt must:\n\n3.2.3.1.1 Where arranging for another to act, take reasonable steps to ensure that those acting understand their obligations under the relevant law;\n\n3.2.3.1.2 Where a registered person, its officers or employees are acting themselves, ensure they are suitable, competent and understand their duties under the relevant laws and comply with\nthe requirements of the relevant laws, including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended;\n\n3.2.3.1.3 Be able to demonstrate that reasonable care has been taken to have knowledge of the activities of the companies or partnerships for which it acts or arranges for another to act as director or partner, and any material changes thereto; \n\n3.2.3.1.4 Have adequate procedures to ensure that, where appropriate, relevant documentation is subject to legal review; and\n\n3.2.3.1.5 Keep or satisfy itself that someone else is keeping accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the structures under administration.\n\n3.2.4 Where a registered person is providing services defined in Article 2(4)(d) of the FS(J)L (namely acting as or fulfilling the function of or arranging for another person to act as or fulfil the function of a member of the council of a foundation under a registration for Class OA trust company business), it must:\n \n3.2.4.1 Where arranging for another to act, take reasonable steps to ensure that those acting understand their obligations under the relevant law;\n\n3.2.4.2 Where a registered person, its officers or employees are acting themselves, ensure that they are suitable, competent and understand their duties under the relevant laws and comply with the requirements of the relevant laws, including the Foundations (Jersey) Law 2009, as amended;\n\n3.2.4.3 Be able to demonstrate that reasonable care has been taken to have knowledge of the activities of the foundations for which it acts or arranges for another to act and any additional changes thereto; and\n\n3.2.4.4 Keep or (where permitted by legislation) satisfy itself that someone else is keeping accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain transactions and disclose with reasonable\naccuracy the financial position of the foundation under administration.\n\n3.2.5 Where a registered person is providing services defined in Article 2(4)(e) of the\nFS(J)L (namely acting or arranging for another person to act as secretary, alternate,\nassistant or deputy secretary of a company or a limited liability partnership under a\nregistration for Class I trust company business), it must:\n\n3.2.5.1 Where arranging for another to act, take reasonable steps to ensure that those acting understand their obligations under the relevant law;\n\n3.2.5.2 Where a registered person, its officers or employees are acting themselves, ensure they are suitable, competent and understand their duties under the relevant laws and comply with the requirements of the relevant laws including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended; and\n\n3.2.5.3 Take reasonable steps to maintain adequate contact with the directors of the company.\n\n3.2.6 Where a registered person is providing services defined in Article 2(4)(f) of the FS(J)L (namely providing a registered office or business address for a company, a partnership or a foundation under a registration for Class J trust company business), it must:\n\n3.2.6.1  Be suitable, competent and understand its duties under, and comply with the requirements of, the laws of the countries in which the companies, the partnerships, or the foundations, for which it is acting are established;\n\n3.2.6.2 Where holding correspondence (whether postal packets, electronic data or otherwise) for collection or forwarding:\n\n3.2.6.2.1 Understand, and document, the rationale for the service\nand agree written procedures;

and\n\n3.2.10.2 Ensure that the managed trust company(ies) it manages, complies with all aspects of the regulatory framework in Jersey.\n\n3.2.11 Where a registered person is carrying on Class O trust company business, it must\ncomply with paragraphs 3.2.2, 3.2.5, 3.2.6 and 3.2.9 above.\n\n3.2.12 Where a registered person is looking to satisfy itself that someone else is keeping accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the structures under administration (3.2.3.1.5, 3.2.4.4 and 3.2.8.3) then in considering whether it is so satisfied the requirements of 3.7.6 must be taken into consideration in making a determination.\n\n3.2.13 Where a registered person controls customer money it should implement an independent review of the controls over customer money on, at least, an annual basis:\n\n3.2.13. The review shall verify the effectiveness of the registered person’s relevant controls over customer money with particular regard to those controls that prevent the:\n\n3.2.13.1.1 Loss;\n\n3.2.13.1.2 Misuse; and\n\n3.2.13.1.3 Misappropriation of customer money.\n\n3.2.13.2 The review should be performed by an appropriately qualified independent person who may be an internal or external party.\n\n3.2.13.3 Where an internal party performs such review they shall be operationally independent from the individuals or functions within the registered person responsible for the operation of\nthe controls under review.\n\nNotes:\n1. Failure to comply with legislation to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism or the relevant AML/CFT Handbook may form the basis for regulatory action by the JFSC. This is in addition to any legal action that may be taken by the judicial authorities for failure to comply with legislation to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\n2. With respect to 3.2.1.6, the JFSC’s policy on outsourcing is available from the JFSC’s website.\n\n3. With respect to 3.2.10, further information may be found in the JFSC’s Guidance Note\non Managed Trust Company Businesses.\n\n4. With respect to the various risk management provisions under principle 3 of the Code, particularly 3.1, 3.2 and 3.7, it is expected that a registered person will have specifically considered, amongst other risks, the risk of a cyber security incident, and  have in place a corresponding documented policy to identify assets and risks, to protect them, to quickly detect potential cyber security incidents, to respond to contain the impact of an incident and to recover from it.\n\n3.3 Integrity and competence\n\n3.3.1 A registered person must:\n\n3.3.1.1 Ensure its directors, partners, senior managers and all other employees are fit and proper for their roles.\n\n3.3.1.2 Assess and monitor the working practices, competence and probity of its directors, partners, senior managers and other employees.\n\n3.3.1.3 Obtain and retain documentary evidence, which is used by the registered person to assess, both initially and on an on-going basis, the competence of its employees. Evidence may include, but not be limited to:\n\n3.3.1.3.1 Employer references; and\n\n3.3.1.3.2 With respect to trust company business employees, copies of documentary evidence of qualifications held, as appropriate.\n\n3.3.1.4 Ensure that its trust company business employees collectively have a balance of qualifications necessary to fulfil their technical functions and suitable skills and experience to fulfil\ntheir non-technical functions.\n\n3.3.1.5 Ensure the following competency levels are met, at all times:\n\n3.3.1.5.1 75% of the Category A trust company business employees must be suitably qualified;\n\n3.3.1.5.2 75% of Category A and B trust company business employees cumulatively must be suitably qualified; and\n\n3.3.1.6 Notify the JFSC in writing if the percentage of suitably qualified Category C trust company business employees that are either qualified or in the process of studying towards a qualification\ncontained in the TCB professional qualifications guidance note falls below 50%.\n\n3.3.2 Where complex transactions are undertaken or complex structures are administered (either by the nature of the entity or the jurisdiction or the proper law or form of that entity), the registered person must consider requiring more specialised qualifications, experience and other competencies such that they can demonstrate that the trust company business employees are competent and\nadequately supervised.\n\n3.3.3 Where a registered person wishes to request a variance to the professional\nqualifications requirements to recognise an alternative qualification, such a request\nmust:\n\n3.3.4 3.3.3.1 Be made in writing;\n\n3.3.3.2 Include a description of the role of the individual;\n\n3.3.3.3 Include an explanation as to why the registered person considers the alternative qualification to be appropriate for that trust company business employee; and\n\n3.3.3.4 Include confirmation that a copy of the syllabus studied or equivalent is available to the JFSC on request.\n\n3.3.4 Where a Category A, B or C trust company business employee is awarded a qualification other than by way of direct examination a registered person must\nnotify the JFSC in writing.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n1.Guidance as to the circumstances in which the JFSC will consider other written\nvariance requests is provided in the TCB professional qualifications guidance note.\n\n2.Trust company business employees include not only direct employees, but also indirect\nemployees, such as temporary and contracted employees and other contracted service\nproviders.\n\n3.Paragraphs 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.1.2 above are subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders\n(Jersey) Law 2001, which prohibits an employer requesting information from its\nemployees and prospective employees about convictions that are “spent”. This general\nprohibition is subject to exceptions provided by the Rehabilitation of Offenders\n(Exceptions) (Jersey) Regulations 2002, as amended (the Exceptions Regulations).\n\n4.Regulation 21 of the Exceptions Regulations permits a registered person, applicants\nand those intending to apply for registration to request information about all\n“relevant offences”, whether “spent” or not from employees holding certain positions\nand applicants for such positions. To be consistent with the Code, it is necessary for\nemployers to make use of such exceptions when screening employees who are subject\nto these exceptions.\n\n5.Tables 1 - 3 of the First Schedule identify three categories of employee; the category\ninto which any individual falls being determined by the most “senior” role that\nemployee performs. (For example, if an employee has substantially the role of a\nCategory B employee but, rather than being “a decision taker” the employee is the\n“significant decision-taker for customer affairs”, then the employee would be\nregarded as a Category A employee).\n\n6.With respect to “suitably qualified”, this is determined by the category into which an\nindividual falls and is detailed in Tables 1-3 of the First Schedule.\n\n3.4 Continuing professional development (CPD)\n\n3.4.1 The onus is on each registered person to demonstrate the adequacy of its CPD regime.\n\n3.4.2 CPD is a compulsory requirement for all trust company business employees. A registered person is required to maintain CPD records for all such employees\n(although it is permissible for a registered person to require its employees to keep\ntheir own records and account to the registered person on a regular basis).\n\n3.4.3. A registered person is responsible for ensuring that CPD is appropriate for its trust company business employees and this consideration must take into account the employee’s job description and current role and duties and may include future development needs.\n\n3.4.4. A registered person must ensure that Category A and B trust company business employees undertake a minimum of 25 hours per year of CPD. Category C trust company business employees must undertake 15 hours per year of CPD. For all categories of trust company business employees: a maximum of five hours CPD may be relevant reading.\n\n3.4.5. Where a registered person is only registered to carry on Class O trust company business the minimum number of CPD hours is reduced to 15 hours per year.\n\nNotes:\n1.It is recognised that some trust company business employees may be members of\nprofessional bodies that have their own CPD requirements as a condition of continued\nmembership. In these circumstances, it is a matter for a registered person:\n\n(a) Firstly, to ensure that the necessary opportunity is given to such employees to\nenable them to comply with these professional requirements; and,\n\n(b) Secondly, to take a view on the extent to which such professional CPD is\nrelevant to the registered person’s business and may therefore be counted\ntowards the trust company employees’ work-related CPD.\n\n2. It is expected that trust company business employees will achieve their CPD targets by\nadhering to the requirements of their own relevant professional body. However, where\nthe relevant professional body does not prescribe how CPD should be achieved, there\nare a number of acceptable ways to attain the minimum CPD requirement, including,\nbut not restricted to:\n\n(a) Studying for further qualifications;\n\n(b) In-house training, seminars, conferences and product presentations;\n\n(c) Computer-based training;\n\n(d) One-to-one tuition;\n\n(e) Reading relevant professional and trade magazines;\n\n(f) Personal structured study; and\n\n(g) Attending external training courses.\n\n3.5 Compliance function, Compliance Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer and Money\nLaundering Compliance Officer\n\n3.5.1 The senior management (most often the board of directors) of the registered person is responsible for ensuring that it has robust arrangements for compliance with the regulatory framework, these must include:\n\n3.5.1.1 Approval of a compliance policy;\n\n3.5.1.2 Establishment of a permanent and effective compliance function, whose responsibilities are formally documented;\n\n3.5.1.3 Assessment, on at least an annual basis, of the extent to which compliance risk is managed effectively; and\n\n3.5.1.4 Appointment of an appropriately skilled and experienced person as its Compliance Officer.\n\n3.5.2 The compliance function must:\n\n3.5.2.1 Have appropriate independence;\n\n3.5.2.2 Have direct access to senior management and board of directors, or equivalent;\n\n3.5.2.3 Have unfettered access to all business lines, support departments and information necessary to properly discharge the responsibilities of the function; \n\n3.5.2.4 Act as the principal point of contact for employees on day-to- day regulatory matters; and\n\n3.5.2.5 Be able to devote sufficient time, and have sufficient resources, to discharge properly the responsibilities of the function, including implementation of the compliance policy.\n\n3.5.3 The registered person must ensure that the Compliance Officer is responsible for:\n\n3.5.3.1 Ensuring appropriate monitoring of operational performances and managing regulatory and compliance risk within the registered person, which includes:\n\n3.5.3.1.1 Monitoring that the internal policies and procedures are being consistently and effectively adhered to;\n\n3.5.3.1.2 Assessing and recommending amendments to internal systems and controls as well as policies, and procedures to facilitate compliance with the regulatory framework; and\n\n3.5.3.1.3 Where appropriate, promptly instigating action to remedy any deficiencies in the robust arrangements;\n\n3.5.3.2 Providing senior management and the board of directors of the registered person with regular written reports in respect of the registered person’s compliance with the requirements of the FS(J)L, Orders (issued under the FS(J)L) and the Code; and\n\n3.5.3.3 Acting as the principal point of contact with the JFSC on day-to- day regulatory matters.\n\n3.5.4 The Compliance Officer must:\n\n3.5.4.1 Be an individual operating under a contract of employment directly with the registered person or another company within the same group;\n\n3.5.4.2 Be based in Jersey;\n\n3.5.4.3 Have sufficient experience and skills which includes, holding an appropriate compliance or other qualification or be studying towards such a qualification; and\n\n3.5.4.4 Have appropriate status and authority within the registered person to ensure that senior management and the board of directors of the registered person react to and determine whether to act upon his or her recommendations.\n\n3.5.5. In the event that a Compliance Officer is temporarily unable to fulfil his/her responsibilities the registered person must:\n\n3.5.5.1 Notify the JFSC; and\n\n3.5.5.2 Designate an appropriately skilled and experienced alternate.\n\n3.5.6. With respect to 3.5.5, notification to the JFSC must be made, in writing, as soon as the registered person becomes aware that the Compliance Officer will be temporarily unable to fulfil their responsibilities.\n\nNotes:\n1.There is no specific requirement for a registered person to be subject to an internal\naudit review. However, the JFSC will recognise and take comfort from those registered\npersons that have effective internal audit controls, or where such functions are\nprovided from elsewhere within a group.\n\n2. It is a requirement of the Money Laundering Order that a registered person must\nappoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer and Money Laundering Compliance\nOfficer. The relevant AML/CFT Handbook sets out additional requirements for\nregistered persons. The JFSC expects the Money Laundering Compliance Officer to\nform part of the compliance function.\n\n3. The roles of Compliance Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer and Money\nLaundering Compliance Officer meet the definition of a key person, as defined by\nArticle 1 of the FS(J)L: consequently, Article 14 of the FS(J)L applies.\n\n4. The Compliance Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer and Money Laundering\nCompliance Officer may be the same person. It is also recognised that there may be\nregistered persons where the compliance function is the Compliance Officer.\n\n5. Where a registered person is a managed entity, it is acceptable for the managed entity\nto enter into an agreement with their manager for the provision of a Compliance\nOfficer, a Money Laundering Reporting Officer and a Money Laundering Compliance\nOfficer.\n\n6. When considering a key person application, the JFSC will not only look at the suitability\nof the qualifications and experience of the applicant, but will also consider this in the\ncontext of the qualification and experience of the balance of the board and/or other\nkey persons employed by the registered person.\n\n7. With respect to 3.5.5 the JFSC considers a period of in excess of four weeks to  constitute temporarily unable to fulfil his/her responsibilities.\n\n3.6 Complaints\n\n3.6.1 A registered person must establish and maintain an effective complaint handling system and procedures and in particular must:\n\n3.6.1.1.  Maintain adequate records of complaints against the registered person, including a central register that contains details of any agreed compensation or compromise;\n\n3.6.1.2 Inform customers of how complaints may be made and how they may expect these to be responded to;\n\n3.6.1.3. Handle complaints transparently, competently, diligently, and impartially;\n\n3.6.1.4.Provide, in writing, within five business days, unless expressly agreed by the complainant to the contrary an acknowledgement that their complaint has been received and confirm that the complaint is being considered;\n\n3.6.1.5 Keep the complainant informed about the progress of their complaint, including details of any actions being taken to resolve their complaint;\n\n3.6.1.6.Advise the complainant in writing when the complaint is considered closed and where the complaint is not upheld, clearly state the reason(s) for rejecting the complaint;\n\n3.6.1.7. Comply with the requirement of 5.2.12, in relation to determining whether a complaint gives rise to any notification requirement under its professional indemnity insurance policy; and\n\n3.6.1.8. Consider the complaints data for patterns emerging.\n\n3.6.2. As soon as it becomes aware, a registered person must notify the JFSC promptly, in writing, if:\n\n3.6.2.1 A complaint is not satisfactorily resolved within three months of it being lodged;\n\n3.6.2.2 A pattern to complaints is identified; or\n\n3.6.2.3 Any complaint results in a claim under the registered person’s professional indemnity insurance policy.\n\nNote:\n1. With respect to 3.6.2, “as soon as it becomes aware” applies from the point at which\nthe registered person knows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that any of the\nmatters stated has occurred or may be about to occur, even where it is outside the\ncontrol of the registered person.\n\n3.7 Record keeping\n\nNote:\n1. This section explains the minimum standards of record keeping that are required in\nrespect of a registered person’s own business and the trust company business\nservices that it is providing.\n\nAll records\n\n3.7.1 3.7.2 3.7.3 3.7.4 A registered person must ensure that it has appropriate record keeping\narrangements for compliance with the applicable Laws (including anti-money\nlaundering legislation and company legislation), Orders and regulatory\nrequirements, set by the Code or the relevant AML/CFT Handbook.\n\nA registered person is expected to maintain such books and records in a language\nunderstood by the employees of the business. These must be translated into\nEnglish at the request of the JFSC. \n\nA registered person must be able to readily retrieve them in Jersey and, if kept otherwise than in legible form, maintain them so as to be readable at a computer terminal in Jersey so that they may be produced in legible form without delay.\n\nA registered person must have a clearly documented policy and procedure\nregarding record retention that includes:\n\n3.7.3.1 Periodic review of the accessibility and condition of paper and\nelectronic records;\n\n3.7.3.2 The adequacy of the safekeeping of records; and\n\n3.7.3.3 Periodic testing of procedures relating to the retrieval of\nrecords.\n\nA registered person that is ceasing to conduct trust company business is required to\narrange appropriate record keeping arrangements as part of a cessation of business\nplan.\n\nBusiness records\n\n3.7.5 3.7.6 Customer records\n\n3.7.7 3.7.8 A registered person must maintain an audit trail of material changes to the policies\nand procedures manual that covers the operation of the registered person, which is\nupdated as required. When updates are made, the effective date of such updates\nmust be recorded and the superseded records maintained. This is especially true in\nrespect of 3.2.1.1.1, 3.2.1.1.5 and 3.2.1.1.6.\n\nThe period for which business records must be kept is the later of:\n\n3.7.6.1 3.7.6.2 The period required for any particular record by any law;\nThe relevant AML/CFT Handbook; or\n\n3.7.6.3 Where records relate to significant corporate governance\nmatters, such as management meeting minutes and risk\nassessment matters, or are records relating to requirements\nestablished by the Code - ten years from the date of the\nrecord.\n\nA registered person is expected to keep adequate, orderly and up-to-date customer\nrecords which are in line with:\n\n3.7.7.1 The requirements, including retention period, set for any\nparticular record by any law; and\n\n3.7.7.2 The requirements established by Part 4 of the Money\nLaundering Order and as set out in the relevant AML/CFT\nHandbook.\n\nWhere the Code requires customer related records to be kept, which are in addition\nto the records required by the Money Laundering Order, these must be kept for at\nleast five years from the date of the event to which the record relates.\n\n3.7.9 With respect to 3.7.7, if it is the case that the record retention periods differ, the\ncustomer records must be retained for the longest designated period.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. 3. The Code does not establish any retention requirements for tape recordings of\ntelephone conversations.\nWith respect to 3.7.5, a change to the policies and procedures manual that\nnecessitates communication to impacted staff is a material change.\nWith respect to 3.7.6.1, the JFSC considers that laws relating to companies, tax,\nproceeds of crime, and data protection may be relevant.\n\n3.8 Payment of financial penalties\n\n3.8.1 A registered person must not pay a financial penalty imposed by the JFSC on any\nother person.\n\n\n4 A registered person must be transparent in its business\narrangements.\n\n4.1 4.2 4.3 A registered person must disclose on its stationery and advertising material that it is\nregulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.\n\nA registered person must communicate with customers in a way that is adequate, fair and not\nmisleading.\n\nA registered person must be open and transparent about its fees and charges, in relation to\nthe provision of trust and company services, including:\n\n4.3.1 In advance of taking an appointment, reaching agreement on, and documenting,\nthe basis for its fees and charges, including the ability to make changes to the basis\nfor determining fees;\n\n4.3.2 Disclosure of all fees and charges associated with the trust company service\nprovided, as either a monetary or percentage figure, including, but not limited to,\nany:\n\n4.4 4.5 4.3.2.1 Group related charges;\n\n4.3.2.2 Commissions (both initial and recurring); and\n\n4.3.2.3 Payments to or from third parties (such as introductory fees or\ncommission sharing arrangements);\n\n4.3.3 The manner by which fees and charges will be collected, including whether agreed\nfees and charges will be deducted directly from the customer’s assets without their\nprior approval – effectively a “no surprises” policy; and\n\n4.3.4 In relation to the termination of services, whether fees paid in advance are\nrefundable in the event of termination.\n\nA registered person must accurately record the basis of any charges in respect of time spent\nand disbursements and make the relevant records available to customers upon request.\n\nA registered person must supply a person to whom it provides a service set out in Article 2(4)\nof the FS(J)L with confirmation, in writing, of the services that it is providing as well as a\ncontract, agreement or other written form setting out its general and specific terms\nassociated with providing those services (accepting in the case of Article 2(4)(h) of the FS(J)L\nthat the identity and existence of a person to whom the service is provided will be\ndependent upon such terms and circumstances as might prevail at any particular point during\nthe lifecycle of an express trust). This documentation must:\n\n4.5.1 Be distinguishable from marketing or promotional material;\n\n4.5.2 Be consistent with the Code;\n\n4.5.3 Be clearly expressed in plain language that only uses technical or legal terms where\nabsolutely necessary;\n\n4.5.4 Be provided prior to the provision of any trust company business service, except\nwhen it is impractical to do so, in which case the document shall be provided at the\nearliest available opportunity;\n\n4.5.5 Explain whether the registered person is acting as a principal or as the agent of the\nperson to whom the service is provided or any other person;\n\n4.5.6 4.5.7 Where the registered person holds customer money, set out the terms on which\nthat money is held;\n\nInclude all appropriate information relevant to the service that will be provided.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. For the purpose of 4.1, the JFSC considers that, at a minimum, “stationery” includes:\nheaded letter paper; emails sent in lieu of a letter; and facsimiles. The JFSC does not\nconsider the following to be stationery unless they are quite clearly being utilised in\nlieu of a letter or as advertising material: text messages; account statements;\nbusiness cards; and compliment slips.\n\nIf, in the case of any one customer or customers, it is impractical or inappropriate to\nprovide the information required by paragraphs 4.3 directly, it would be sufficient in\nsuch instances for the registered person to ensure that the general basis for their\ncharges, the ability to make changes to the basis for determining fees and a scale of\ncharges, are available on request.\n\n5 A registered person must maintain, and be able to\ndemonstrate the existence of, adequate financial\nresources and adequate insurance.\n\n5.1 Financial resources\n\n5.1.1 5.1.2 5.1.3 5.1.4 5.1.5 5.1.6 5.1.7 Where a registered person is a Jersey registered company that holds a registration to undertake deposit-taking business, and consequently provides the JFSC with a quarterly prudential report, the Adjusted Net Liquid Assets (ANLA) requirements set by the Code do not apply.\n\nWhere the registered person operates in Jersey as a branch of a legal entity\nregistered outside Jersey that holds a registration to undertake deposit-taking\nbusiness and its immediate home regulator applies Basel II prudential requirements\nor has implemented the 1997 Market Risk Accord then the ANLA requirements set\nby the Code do not apply. \n\nRegistered persons to whom this paragraph applies must notify the JFSC, in writing.\n\nWhere a registered person is a 100% subsidiary of a Jersey incorporated company\nregistered to carry on deposit-taking business it may apply to the JFSC, in writing,\nfor a variance (exemption) from completing the ANLA calculation. Such a variance\nwill only be considered if the deposit-taker provides a letter of undertaking,\nacceptable to the JFSC, in respect of providing financial support to the trust\ncompany.\n\nA registered person must maintain:\n\n5.1.4.1 A minimum of £25,000 paid up share capital (or evidenced net\nassets position for non-incorporated entities) and a minimum\nsurplus of ANLA over the Expenditure Requirement in the ratio\nof 110% in accordance with the calculation set out in the\nSecond Schedule; and\n\n5.1.4.2 A minimum net assets position of £25,000 at all times.\nA registered person must immediately notify the JFSC in writing if the nominal value\nof fully paid shares is less than £25,000. Where the registered person has a\ncombination of fully paid shares and share premium that exceeds £25,000 in total,\nthe JFSC may deem the registered person to have satisfied the first part of\nparagraph 5.1.4.1.\n\nA registered person must perform the calculation set out in the Second Schedule as\nappropriate to the business, but at least once every three months. In addition, the\nfrequency of the calculation shall increase to monthly or other such period as the\nJFSC may determine, if either:\n\n5.1.6.1 A registered person’s ANLA falls below 130% of its Expenditure\nRequirement; or\n\n5.1.6.2 An event occurs which has a material adverse effect on the\nregistered person’s financial resources.\nIn respect of a registered person that is part of an affiliation:\n\n5.1.7.1 Each affiliation member must comply with the minimum share\ncapital requirement and with the minimum ANLA requirement;\n\nOR\n\n5.1.7.2 5.1.8 5.1.9 5.1.10 Only the affiliation leader need comply with the minimum\nshare capital and ANLA requirements provided that the\naffiliation leader is able to prepare consolidated financial\ninformation that enables it to perform, at least once every\nthree months, the financial resource requirement calculation in\nrespect of the affiliation in accordance with paragraph 5.1.4.1.\n\nA registered person is required to immediately notify the JFSC in writing (in addition\nto any notification obligation under the FS(J)L or the Code):\n\n5.1.8.1 If its ANLA falls below 130% of its Expenditure Requirement;\n\n5.1.8.2 If its ANLA falls below 110% of its Expenditure Requirement;\nand\n5.1.8.3 Of any transaction or situation that appears not to be catered\nfor in, or where the application of, the Second Schedule might\ngive a misleading impression of the adequacy of the financial\nresources.\n\nThe JFSC may, on written application by a registered person, consider a variance to\nthe notification obligation as stated in 5.1.8.1.\n\nWhere a registered person wishes to make an application for a variation to the\ntreatment of assets, liabilities and/or expenditure items in the ANLA calculation this\nmust be made in writing to the JFSC.\n\nSubordinated Loans\n\n5.1.11 5.1.12 5.1.13 On submission of a written request, by the registered person, the JFSC will consider granting consent to exclude a long term subordinated loan as a liability within the\nANLA calculation. Any request must be accompanied by a signed consent request\nchecklist and such consent is only likely to be granted where:\n\n5.1.11.1 The subordinated loan is drawn up in accordance with the\nJFSC’s proforma Subordinated Loan Agreement; and\n\n5.1.11.2 The subordinated loan is made by an approved lender.\nSpecifically, with respect to the subordinated loan referred to in 5.1.11 the\nSubordinated Loan Agreement must be signed by authorised signatories of all\nparties to the agreement, and:\n\n5.1.12.1 Be for a fixed period of not less than two years; or\n\n5.1.12.2 Where no fixed term is cited, be subject to a minimum notice\nperiod of repayment of at least two years.\n\nWhere the JFSC has considered and granted a variance in respect of the treatment\nof a subordinated loan within the ANLA calculation, the amount deducted may not\nexceed the lower of:\n\n5.1.13.1 5.1.13.2 5.1.14 The drawn down amount of the subordinated loan; and\nFour times the net assets position of the registered person,\ncalculated using the registered person’s latest audited financial\nstatements.\nThe variance treatment for the subordinated loan will automatically fall away if\neither:\n\n5.1.15 5.1.14.1 The registered person fails to comply with any of the\nrequirements of the subordinated loan agreement, including\nthe notification requirements; or\n\n5.1.14.2 The subordinated loan repayment date falls due within one\nyear.\n\nIn addition to being a signatory to the Subordinated Loan Agreement, the JFSC will\nplace a condition on the registered person’s registration, utilising Article 10 of the\nFS(J)L, requiring that they comply in full with the terms of the Subordinated Loan\nAgreement.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. 3. 4. “net assets” is defined as total assets less total liabilities.\n\nThe JFSC has published a guidance note on the ANLA calculation which is available\nfrom the policy statements and guidance notes section of the JFSC website.\n\nThe proforma Subordinated Loan Agreement and consent request checklist are\navailable from the JFSC website.\n\nFor the purposes of 5.1.11.2 an approved lender is:\n\n(a) A financial service business as defined by Article 2 of the FS(J)L; or\n\n(b) A financial service business regulated by a “relevant supervisory authority”, as\ndefined by Article 1 of the FS(J)L;\n\n(c) A person that is registered by the JFSC to carry on deposit-taking business under\nArticle 9 of the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991;\n\n(d) A principal person of the registered person; or\n\n(e) A person that does not meet any of the above criteria but whom has been\nspecifically approved by the JFSC.\n\n5.2 Insurance Arrangements\n\n5.2.1 5.2.2 5.2.3 A registered person must have and maintain adequate insurance cover at all times,\ncommensurate with its business activities.\n\n5.2.1.1 Such cover must include professional indemnity insurance (PII) extended to include fidelity guarantee (employee dishonesty or fraud) insurance and director's and officer's insurance.\n\nPII cover and extensions must include negligence and errors and omissions by a registered person and employee dishonesty and must, where possible, extend to all territories from which a registered person conducts business.\n\nA registered person must not enter into, arrange, claim on or make a payment\nunder a contract of insurance that is intended to have, or has or would have, the\neffect of indemnifying any person against all or part of a financial penalty imposed\nby the JFSC.\n\n5.2.4 5.2.5 5.2.6 5.2.7 5.2.8 5.2.9 5.2.10 PII cover must be written on a “claims-made” basis including costs and expenses and, so far as lawful, must include:\n\n5.2.4.1 Legal defence costs;\n\n5.2.4.2 Loss or theft of documents (liability and costs of replacement,\nreinstatement, restoration or reconstruction of data);\n\n5.2.4.3 Self-employed or contract hire persons engaged in a registered\nperson’s business; and\n\n5.2.4.4 Indemnity to current or former employees, partners and\nconsultants.\n\nSubject to 5.2.6, the minimum indemnity limit for any one claim and in the\naggregate must equal or exceed the greater of:\n\n5.2.5.1 Three times the amount of relevant fees and commissions;\n\n5.2.5.2 Thirty times the amount of relevant fees and commissions\nfrom a registered person’s single largest customer (including all\nrelated customers); or\n\n5.2.5.3 £5,000,000 (five million pounds sterling).\nA registered person shall not be required by virtue of 5.2.5 to have aggregate\ninsurance cover exceeding £10,000,000 (ten million pounds sterling).\nIn the event that a registered person’s aggregate level of PII cover is depleted as a\nresult of a claim on its policy, such that it is no longer sufficient to meet the\nrequirements set out in 5.2.5, a registered person must obtain reinstated cover that\nmeets the requirements set out under paragraph 5.2.5.\n\nAny excess (or deductible) per claim on the policy must not:\n\n5.2.8.1 Exceed £20,000 (twenty thousand pounds sterling) or 3% of\nthe annual relevant fees and commissions, whichever is\ngreater; or\n\n5.2.8.2 Reduce the limit of indemnity payable under the policy such\nthat it is insufficient to meet the minimum indemnity limit\nprescribed under 5.2.5.\nIn the case of an affiliation, it is the responsibility of the affiliation leader to\ndemonstrate to the JFSC that the insurance cover maintained meets the\nrequirements of paragraphs 5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 5.2.4. This may be achieved by:\n\n5.2.9.1 Each participating member of the affiliation complying with the\nPII requirements as though each member was a non affiliated\nperson;\n\n5.2.9.2 Each participating member of the affiliation is named on a\nsingle PII policy, the extent of cover being determined in\naccordance with paragraph 5.2.5 and is based on the\naggregated affiliation relevant fees and commissions; or\n\n5.2.9.3 A combination of the alternatives set out in paragraphs 5.2.9.1\nand 5.2.9.2.\n\nAs soon as it becomes aware, a registered person must notify the JFSC in writing of\nany material limitations in its PII policy, including the basis on which the limitation has been applied, in respect of matters such as:\n\n5.2.11 5.2.12 5.2.13 5.2.10.1 An inability to obtain PII cover in line with the requirements of 5.2.4 or 5.2.5;\n\n5.2.10.2 Any territory from which a registered person conducts business or may reasonably be expected to conduct business;\n\n5.2.10.3 Any exclusion applied by way of endorsements;\n\n5.2.10.4 Any retroactive date applied to the PII policy;\n\n5.2.10.5 The cancellation of the PII policy;\n\n5.2.10.6 If a registered person becomes aware that it has conducted any activity that is not covered by the PII policy; and\n\n5.2.10.7 If a registered person’s aggregate level of PII cover is depleted as described at 5.2.7.\n\nA registered person that is ceasing to conduct a class of financial service business is\nrequired to arrange for appropriate “run off” PII cover in respect of claims arising\nfrom past acts or omissions. The level of such cover will require the JFSC’s consent\nas part of a cessation of business plan.\n\nA registered person must have adequate procedures in place to ensure compliance\nwith all terms and conditions set out in its PII policy, particularly in relation to the\ntimely notification of events by a registered person to its insurer, which may lead to\na claim on the policy by a registered person.\n\nWhere a registered person may be subject to an Eligible complaint as defined at\nArticle 7 of the Financial Services Ombudsman (Jersey) Law 2014, in addition to the\nrequirements at 5.2.4, a registered person must ensure that its PII cover is adequate\nin the event that a Determination is made against a registered person by the\nChannel Islands Financial Ombudsman.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. With respect to 5.2, a registered person may consider allocating responsibility to a\nnamed principal person to ensure that adequate insurance cover is maintained at all\ntimes (5.2.1) and that a registered person is in compliance with all terms and conditions\nset out in its PII policy (5.2.12).\n\nParagraph 5.2.3 is not intended to prevent a registered person from entering into,\narranging, claiming on or making any payment under a contract of insurance which\nindemnifies any person against all or part of the costs of defending JFSC enforcement\naction or any costs the person may be ordered to pay to the JFSC.\n\nWith respect to 5.2.5.1 and 5.2.5.2,“relevant fees and commissions” for PII purposes is\ngross income paid or payable to a registered person, which is fees, commission,\nbrokerage, or other relevant income arising from professional business activities\n(regulated or not) covered under the PII policy. This applies for the last accounting year\nbefore the start or renewal of the policy, or as per the business plan for new applicants.\nWith respect to 5.2.10 “as soon as it becomes aware” applies from the point at which a\nregistered person knows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that any of the\nmatters stated has occurred or may be about to occur, even where it is outside the\ncontrol of a registered person.\n\nThe JFSC has issued a guidance note on professional indemnity insurance, available from\nthe policy statements and guidance notes page of the JFSC website, which a registered\nperson may find helpful when considering the PII requirements. Specifically,\n\n6. 7. 8. (a) With respect to the material limitations notification required by paragraph\n5.2.10, paragraph 3.1 of the guidance note provides a list of exclusions and\nlimitations that the JFSC considers standard and therefore fall outside of the\nnotification requirement; and\n\n(b) Paragraph 6.3.2 of the guidance note highlights the information to be submitted to the JFSC when requesting a variance to enter into a self-insurance arrangement.\n\nWith respect to 5.2.9, PII cover for an affiliation may be arranged by the affiliation\nleader for the whole affiliation.\n\nWith respect to 5.2.11, the JFSC will generally expect to see “run off” PII cover covering\na period of at least three years.\n\nThe requirements of paragraph 5.2.1 may be satisfied by a registered person being covered under the provisions of a group PII policy if such cover is sufficient to satisfy the requirements under paragraphs 5.2.1 to 5.2.6.\n\n6 A registered person must deal with the JFSC in an open\nand co-operative manner.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. 3. 4. There is a need for candour and co-operation in a registered person’s relationship with\nthe JFSC. Article 28(3) of the FS(J)L provides that a registered person or formerly\nregistered person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she fails to provide the JFSC with\nany information in his or her possession, knowing or having reasonable cause to\nbelieve that or being reckless as to whether –\n\n(a) The information is relevant to the exercise by the JFSC of its functions under the\nFS(J)L in relation to the registered person or formerly registered person; and\n\n(b) The withholding of the information is likely to result in the JFSC being misled as\nto any matter which is relevant to and of material significance for the exercise\nof those functions in relation to the registered person or formerly registered\nperson.\n\nThe scope of Principle 6 is extended to the provision of information and the\nnotification of events concerning non-regulated activities and other members of the\ncorporate group, to the extent that such information or events might reasonably be\nexpected to have a material impact on the registered person in Jersey.\n\nNotification to the Companies Registry does not constitute notification to the JFSC for\nthe purposes of this Principle.\n\nThe JFSC considers that the obligations of a registered person under this Principle\ninclude the timely provision of data required in connection with a registered person’s\nregulatory fees and the timely payment of fees due.\n\nGeneral Notifications\n\n6.1 6.2 A registered person must advise the JFSC in writing as soon as it becomes aware of any\nmatter that might reasonably be expected to affect its registration or be in the interests of its\ncustomers to disclose. Wherever possible this notification must include details of the steps\nthe registered person has taken, or intends to take, to mitigate the matter.\n\nA registered person must comply with the notification requirements of the JFSC’s policy on\noutsourcing as may be updated from time to time.\n\nNote:\n1. With respect to 6.1, “as soon as it becomes aware” applies from the point at which the\nregistered person knows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that any of the\nmatters referred to have occurred or may be about to occur, even where it is outside\nthe control of the registered person. The JFSC considers the following indicative that\nnotification is necessary. Any matter which:\n\n(a) Is material to the JFSC’s ability to undertake its function of supervision of\nfinancial services provided in or from within Jersey;\n\n(b) The registered person considers is material to, or may make it impractical for it\nto comply with, one or more of:\n\ni. The provisions of the FS(J)L or any Regulation or Order made under it;\n\nii. Compliance with a registration condition;\n\niii. Compliance with a direction issued by the JFSC;\n\niv. The Code;\n\nv. The fitness and propriety of its principal persons, key persons or trust\ncompany business employees, especially where the registered person has\nimposed a formal disciplinary measure or sanction.\n\nSpecific Notifications\n\n6.3 A registered person must notify the JFSC of the following, in writing, not less than 10 business\ndays before the change is implemented:\n\n6.3.1 A change in the name of the registered person;\n\n6.3.2 The adoption of, or a change in, any business name under which the registered\nperson carries on trust company business;\n\n6.3.3 A change to:\n\n6.3.3.1 The address of the principal office of the registered person,\n\n6.3.3.2 The address of the registered office of the registered person,\nAnd\n\n6.3.3.3 Any address which is treated as the proper address of the\nregistered person by Article 40(6) of the FS(J)L;\n\n6.3.4 A change to the capital structure of a registered person (includes, inter alia, the\nissuance of preference shares and buy back of ordinary shares), in particular:\n\n6.3.4.1 Where an opinion has been obtained on accounting for any\naspect of the change this should be provided to the JFSC as\npart of the notification, and\n\n6.3.4.2 The revised capital structure must not take effect until the JFSC\nhas provided the registered person with a letter of no objection\nin relation to the proposed structure;\n\n6.3.5 The details of any loan which has been granted to a registered person and for which\npayment of the remaining balance has been waived such that the remaining\nbalance is accounted for as a credit to reserves;\n\n6.3.6 Any proposal to “reinstate” a loan balance (either in full or in part) which meets the\ncriteria set out in 6.3.5; and\n\n6.3.7 The summary winding up or voluntary dissolution of a registered person.\n\n6.4 A registered person must notify the JFSC, in writing, within a reasonable time of becoming\naware of, or resolving to undertake, any of the following:\n\n6.4.1 The decision to voluntarily cease a business activity, whether temporarily or\npermanently, where this decision involves the revocation of a registration in\naccordance with Article 9(4)(a) of the FS(J)L, in this case a registered person must\ncomplete a Cessation of Business Plan, as prescribed by the JFSC, which must\ninclude details of arrangements for the protection of customers, creditors and other\n\n6.4.2 6.4.3 6.4.4 6.4.5 6.4.6 6.4.7 6.4.8 6.4.9 6.4.10 6.4.11 6.4.12 6.4.13 6.4.14 6.4.15 stakeholders. Before implementing a Cessation of Business Plan a registered person must obtain written confirmation from the JFSC that it has no objection to it;\n\nThe presentation of any application to the court for désastre;\n\nThe summoning of any meeting to consider a resolution to wind-up a registered person or the winding up of the registered person;\n\nThe application by any person for the commencement of any insolvency proceedings, appointment of any receiver, administrator or provisional liquidator under the law of any country in respect of the registered person;\n\nThe making or any proposals for the making of a composition or arrangement with creditors of the registered person;\n\nThe imposition of disciplinary measures or disciplinary sanctions on the registered person or any of their principal persons or key persons by any relevant supervisory authority or professional body;\n\nThe conviction of the registered person or any of its principal persons or key persons, for any offence:\n\n6.4.7.1 Under legislation of any jurisdiction relating to the conduct of financial services business (includes legislation relating to: banking, building societies, collective investment funds, companies, credit unions, consumer credit, friendly societies, insolvency, insurance, industrial and provident societies and trust companies), or\n\n6.4.7.2 Involving fraud or dishonesty;\n\nThe imposition of any penalties for deliberate tax evasion on the registered person\nor any of its principal persons or key persons;\n\nThe re-registration of a registered person incorporated with unlimited liability as a\nlimited liability company;\n\nA general partner in a registered person becoming a limited partner;\n\nThe granting, withdrawal or refusal of any application for authorisation to carry on\nany regulated business in Jersey, or any jurisdiction outside Jersey, or the\nrevocation of such authorisation;\n\nThe withdrawal of an application for membership of any professional body by the\nregistered person, or principal person or key person of the registered person, in any\njurisdiction, or refusal or revocation of such a membership;\n\nThe appointment of inspectors (howsoever named) by a statutory or other\nregulatory authority to investigate the affairs of the registered person;\n\nAny litigation following the institution of proceedings before a Court of Law:\n\n6.4.14.1 Instigated by the registered person (or a subsidiary of the\nregistered person),\n\n6.4.14.2 Instigated against the registered person, or\n\n6.4.14.3 Where the registered person is a party cited;\n\nAny decision relating to business activities likely to have a material effect on the\nregistered person or its profitability (notifications must specify, as applicable, the\nname of any company and its principal business), such decisions include, but are\nnot limited to the:\n\n6.4.16 6.4.17 6.4.18 6.4.19 6.4.20 6.4.21 6.4.15.1 Introduction of a new business activity,\n\n6.4.15.2 Closure to new business,\n\n6.4.15.3 Formation, acquisition, disposal or dissolution of a subsidiary, associated group company or branch office, wherever situated,\nAnd\n\n6.4.15.4 Changes to investments held, where the registered person acquires or disposes, for its own benefit, of a holding of more than half in nominal value of the equity share capital of a company, specifying the name of the company and its principal business;\n\nWhere a registered person is acting as a manager of a managed trust company\n(under a trust company business Class N registration) the intention to resign as the\nmanager;\n\nAn intention to be appointed as a manager of a managed trust company (under a trust company business Class N registration);\n\nWhere a registered person administers a private trust company business, changes in\nthe status of such companies, such that:\n\n6.4.18.1 The administration is transferred to another registered person\nor registered persons,\n\n6.4.18.2 Another registered person or registered persons are appointed\nto jointly provide administration services, or\n\n6.4.18.3 Where a registered person ceases to provide administration\nservices; and Any material changes, other than those specifically referred to in the Code, in the\ninformation previously submitted under the following headings, any:\n\n6.4.19.1 Overseas operations through which the registered person carries on trust company business, irrespective of the vehicle utilised to deliver the business (branch, subsidiary, representative office or otherwise), and\n\n6.4.19.2 Jurisdictions outside Jersey in which the registered person carries on trust company business indicating whether this is done through a branch office, a subsidiary or otherwise.\nA decision by the registered person’s auditor to qualify its audit report or to raise an emphasis of matter therein;\n\nAny material deficiencies in the effectiveness of controls over customer money\nidentified during an independent review as required by paragraph 3.2.13.\n\nNotes:\n1. With respect to 6.4, the JFSC considers\n(a) (b) “a reasonable time” to be five business days; and\nThat “becoming aware” applies from the point at which the registered person\nknows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that any of the matters stated\nhas occurred or may be about to occur, even where it is outside of the control of\nthe registered person.\n\n2. 3. With respect to 6.4.1, a full outline of the matters that must be addressed within the\nCOBP is available from the JFSC upon request.\n\nWith respect to 6.4.18, it should be noted that private trust company business is\ndefined in the Financial Services (Trust Company Business (Exemptions)) (Jersey) Order\n2000 as meaning:\n\nA person being a company –\n(a) The purpose of which is\ni. Solely to provide trust company business services in respect of a specific trust\nor trusts; or\n\nii. To act for that purpose and to act as a member of the council of a\nfoundation or of foundations (otherwise than as a qualified member, as\nthat term is defined by the Foundations (Jersey) Law 2009);\n\n(b) That does not solicit from or provide trust company business services to the\npublic; and\n\n(c) The administration of which is carried out by a registered person registered to\ncarry out trust company business,\n\nWhen providing a service specified in Article 2(4) of the Law where the name of the\ncompany is notified to the JFSC.\n\nNotifications arising in other parts of the Code\n\n6.5 A registered person is required to comply with notification requirements established in other\nparts of the Code:\n\n6.5.1 6.5.2 6.5.3 6.5.4 6.5.5 6.5.6 6.5.7 6.5.8 3.1.2.2 sets a requirement to contact the JFSC as soon as a registered person becomes aware that the regulatory span of control requirements will not be\nmaintained, including where regulatory span of control is maintained with the minimum number of individuals of which one is absent for a substantial period of time;\n\n3.3.1.6 sets a notification requirement regarding the percentage of suitably\nqualified Category C trust company business employees;\n\n3.3.4 sets a notification requirement where a qualification is obtained other than by\nway of examination;\n\n3.5.5 sets a notification requirement in respect of a compliance officer being\ntemporarily unable to fulfil his/her responsibilities;\n\n3.6.2 sets notification requirements in respect of complaints;\n\n5.1.2 sets a notification requirement on registered persons that are branches of a\nlegal entity registered outside Jersey and the registered person is not required to complete the ANLA requirements of the Code;\n\n5.1.8 sets notification requirements in respect of ANLA requirements; and\n\n5.2.10 sets notification requirements in respect of PII.\n\nNotifying or providing information via the JFSC’s online portal\n\n6.6 Where the JFSC so specifies (whether in the Code or otherwise) a registered person must\nnotify or provide information by means of the JFSC’s online portal.\n\n6.7 If, because of a systems failure of any kind, a registered person is unable to access the online\nportal to make a relevant notification or provide required information it must notify the JFSC\nin writing within one business day of the systems failure being identified.\n\n7 A registered person must not make statements that are\nmisleading, false or deceptive.\n\n7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 A registered person must take reasonable steps to ensure that its financial service\nadvertisements (advertisements) are not misleading, false or deceptive. Words used in\nadvertisements must be chosen carefully and certain words, such as “guarantee”, “assured”,\n“confidential” and “secret”, must be treated with great caution.\n\nAn advertisement must not contain:\n7.2.1 A statement, promise or forecast unless the registered person, at the time the\nadvertisement is made has reasonable grounds for believing, is not misleading, false\nor deceptive;\n\n7.2.2 A statement of opinion held by any person unless the registered person, at the time\nthe advertisement is made has reasonable grounds for believing such statement, to\nbe the honestly held opinion of that person at that time;\n\n7.2.3 A statement of fact unless the registered person, at the time the advertisement is\nmade has reasonable grounds for believing such statement will continue to be true\nfor so long as the advertisement continues to be made in current publications;\n\n7.2.4 A statement about the scale of activities of, or any of the activities of, or the\nresources of or available to, a registered person or that registered person’s group or\naffiliation unless the registered person, at the time the advertisement is made has\nreasonable grounds for believing such statement, is not misleading, false or\ndeceptive;\n\n7.2.5 A statement relating to taxation benefits unless it is clearly illustrated by example\nto show what it means in practice and to whom such benefits apply;\n\n7.2.6 A statement relating to customer confidentiality unless it is qualified to show the\nlimits of any confidentiality assurance made;\n\n7.2.7 A statement of comparison with other entities carrying on trust company business\nunless the basis of comparison is clearly stated and the comparison is fair; or\n\n7.2.8 A statement implying that the service is only available for a limited period or in\nlimited form, if such is not the case.\n\nAn advertisement made in a written or broadcast form must not contain:\n\n7.3.1 A statement of fact unless the registered person, at the time the advertisement is\nmade has reasonable grounds, supported by documentary evidence, for believing\nsuch statement to be true; or\n\n7.3.2 A statement of opinion held by any person unless the registered person, at the time\nthe advertisement is made, has reasonable grounds, supported by documentary\nevidence, for believing such statement to be the honestly held opinion of that\nperson at that time.\n\nThe content and format of any advertisement must not:\n\n7.4.1 Be designed so as to be likely to be misunderstood;\n\n7.4.2 Be designed so as to disguise the significance of any warning statement or\ninformation, which is required to be included under the Code; or\n\n7.5 7.6 7.4.3 Signify in any way that the advertisement is approved by the JFSC.\nAn advertisement may include a quotation from a statement made by any person\ncommending any service provided that:\n\n7.5.1 Where the person is an employee or associate of the registered person, that fact is\ndisclosed in the advertisement;\n\n7.5.2 The quotation is included with that person’s written consent;\n\n7.5.3 The statement is relevant to the service that is the subject of the advertisement;\n\n7.5.4 Where the whole of the statement is not quoted, what is quoted represents fairly\nthe message contained in the whole of the statement; and\n\n7.5.5 The statement has not become inaccurate or misleading subsequent to it being\nmade.\n\nThe registered person must be able to demonstrate that adequate disclosure of the key risks\nand the relevant terms and conditions was made to the customer before commitment was\nmade, so as to ensure the customer has made an informed decision.\n\nNotes:\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Article 1 of the FS(J)L defines a “financial service advertisement” as an advertisement\ncontaining – (a) an invitation to transact financial service business; or (b) information\nwhich is intended or might reasonably be presumed to be intended to lead directly or\nindirectly to the transaction of financial service business, and includes any means of\nbringing such an invitation or such information to the notice of any person, and a\nreference to an advertisement shall be construed accordingly. It is the JFSC’s view that\nthis definition covers written, broadcast and oral advertisements.\n\nFor the purpose of Principle 7, \"written\" and \"broadcast\" have the same meaning as\nprovided by Article 1 of the Financial Services (Advertising) (Jersey) Order 2008.\n\nUnder Article 39L of the FS(J)L, it is an offence for any person to knowingly or\nrecklessly make a misleading, false or deceptive statement, promise or forecast for the\npurpose of inducing another person to enter into, or to refrain from entering into, an\nagreement for the provision of financial service business.\n\nThe requirements in Principle 7 are not intended to capture advertising or promotional\nliterature forwarded by the registered person to its customers on behalf of third\nparties.\n\nAdvertisements that meet the exempt criteria set out in Article 2(2) of the Financial\nServices (Advertising) (Jersey) Order 2008 are also exempt from the requirements of\nPrinciple 7.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the FS(J)L does not require advertisements to be approved\nby the JFSC and accordingly the JFSC would not normally contribute to any review or\nvetting process. In serious cases, however the JFSC will consider exercising its powers\nof direction to have an advertisement amended or withdrawn.\n\nIt may not be possible or practicable to list within an advertisement all areas of risk\nthat might apply to a particular product or service. Similarly, it may not be possible or\npracticable to specify all of the relevant terms and conditions. The necessary extent to\nwhich the risk warnings and the terms and conditions are specified in an\nadvertisement will be dependent upon the nature of the products or services being\nadvertised.\n\nThe First Schedule\n\nTrust Company Business Employee Categories and Qualifications\n\nThe full definition of a trust company business employee is provided as part of the TCB Fees available\nfrom the JFSC website. For the purposes of the Code, part (a) of the definition is relevant.\nThe following notes apply to Category, A, B and C trust company business employees:\n\n1. 2. 3.

CPD may include up to a maximum of five hours reading.

You do not bully or harass them or discriminate unfairly against them. If you are a manager you challenge behaviour that does not meet this standard.\n\n2: Dispute resolution and proceedings before courts, tribunals and inquiries\ni\n\t1\tYou do not misuse or tamper with evidence or attempt to do so.\n\t2\tYou do not seek to influence the substance of evidence, including generating false evidence or persuading witnesses to change their evidence.\n\t3\tYou do not provide or offer to provide any benefit to witnesses dependent upon the nature of their evidence or the outcome of the case.\n\t4\tYou only make assertions or put forward statements, representations or submissions to the court or others which are properly arguable.\n\t5\tYou do not place yourself in contempt of court, and you comply with court orders which place obligations on you.\n\t6\tYou do not waste the court's time.\n\t7\tYou draw the court's attention to relevant cases and statutory provisions, or procedural irregularities of which you are aware, and which are likely to have a material effect on the outcome of the proceedings.\n\n3: Service and competence\ni\n\t1\tYou only act for clients on instructions from the client, or from someone properly authorised to provide instructions on their behalf. If you have reason to suspect that the instructions do not represent your client's wishes, you do not act unless you have satisfied yourself that they do. However, in circumstances where you have legal authority to act notwithstanding that it is not possible to obtain or ascertain the instructions of your client, then you are subject to the overriding obligation to protect your client's best interests.\n\t2\tYou ensure that the service you provide to clients is competent and delivered in a timely manner.\n\t3\tYou maintain your competence to carry out your role and keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date.\n\t4\tYou consider and take account of your client's attributes, needs and circumstances.\n\t5\tWhere you supervise or manage others providing legal services:\n\t\t1\tyou remain accountable for the work carried out through them; and\n\t\t2\tyou effectively supervise work being done for clients.\n\t6\tYou ensure that the individuals you manage are competent to carry out their role, and keep their professional knowledge and skills, as well as understanding of their legal, ethical and regulatory obligations, up to date. \n\n4: Client money and assets\ni\n\t1\tYou properly account to clients for any financial benefit you receive as a result of their instructions, except where they have agreed otherwise.\n\t2\tYou safeguard money and assets entrusted to you by clients and others.\n\t3\tYou do not personally hold client money save as permitted under regulation 10.2(b)(vii) of the Authorisation of Individuals Regulations, unless you work in an authorised body, or in an organisation of a kind prescribed under this rule on any terms that may be prescribed accordingly.\nBusiness requirements\n\n5.1-5.3: Referrals, introductions and separate businesses\ni\n\t1\tIn respect of any referral of a client by you to another person, or of any third party who introduces business to you or with whom you share your fees, you ensure that:\n\t\t1\tclients are informed of any financial or other interest which you or your business or employer has in referring the client to another personor which an introducer has in referring the client to you;\n\t\t2\tclients are informed of any fee sharing arrangement that is relevant to their matter;\n\t\t3\tthe fee sharing agreement is in writing;\n\t\t4\tyou do not receive payments relating to a referral or make payments to an introducer in respect of clients who are the subject of criminal proceedings; and\n\t\t5\tany client referred by an introducer has not been acquired in a way which would breach the SRA's regulatory arrangements if the personacquiring the client were regulated by the SRA.\n\t2\tWhere it appears to the SRA that you have made or received a referral fee, the payment will be treated as a referral fee unless you show that the payment was not made as such.\n\t3\tYou only:\n\t\t1\trefer, recommend or introduce a client to a separate business; or\n\t\t2\tdivide, or allow to be divided, a client's matter between you and a separate business;\n\t4\twhere the client has given informed consent to your doing so.\n\n5.4-5.6: Other business requirements\ni\n\t1\tYou must not be a manager, employee, member or interest holder of a business that:\n\t\t1\thas a name which includes the word \"solicitors\"; or\n\t\t2\tdescribes its work in a way that suggests it is a solicitors' firm;\n\t2\tunless it is an authorised body.\n\t1\tIf you are a solicitor who holds a practising certificate, an REL, RFL or RSL, you must complete and deliver to the SRA an annual return in the prescribed form.\n\t2\tIf you are a solicitor or an REL carrying on reserved legal activities for the public or a section of the public in a non-commercial body, you must ensure that:\n\t\t1\tthe body takes out and maintains indemnity insurance; and\n\t\t2\tthis insurance provides adequate and appropriate cover in respect of the services that you provide or have provided, whether or not they comprise reserved legal activities, taking into account any alternative arrangements the body or its clients may make.\nConflict, confidentiality and disclosure\n6.1-6.2: Conflict of interests\ni\n\t1\tYou do not act if there is an own interest conflict or a significant risk of such a conflict.\n\t2\tYou do not act in relation to a matter or particular aspect of it if you have a conflict of interest or a significant risk of such a conflict in relation to that matter or aspect of it, unless:\n\t\t1\tthe clients have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter or the aspect of it, as appropriate;

and\n\t\t\tiii\tyou are satisfied it is reasonable for you to act for all the clients.\n\n6.3-6.5: Confidentiality and disclosure\ni\n\t1\tYou keep the affairs of current and former clients confidential unless disclosure is required or permitted by law or the client consents.\n\t2\tWhere you are acting for a client on a matter, you make the client aware of all information material to the matter of which you have knowledge, except when:\n\t\t1\tthe disclosure of the information is prohibited by legal restrictions imposed in the interests of national security or the prevention of crime;\n\t\t2\tyour client gives informed consent, given or evidenced in writing, to the information not being disclosed to them;\n\t\t3\tyou have reason to believe that serious physical or mental injury will be caused to your client or another if the information is disclosed; or\n\t\t4\tthe information is contained in a privileged document that you have knowledge of only because it has been mistakenly disclosed.\n\t3\tYou do not act for a client in a matter where that client has an interest adverse to the interest of another current or former client of you or your business or employer, for whom you or your business or employer holds confidential information which is material to that matter, unless:\n\t\t1\teffective measures have been taken which result in there being no real risk of disclosure of the confidential information;

and\n\t\t2\tensure that relevant information which is held by you, or by third parties carrying out functions on your behalf which are critical to the delivery of your legal services, is available for inspection by the SRA.\n\t5\tYou do not attempt to prevent anyone from providing information to the SRA or any other body exercising regulatory, supervisory, investigatory or prosecutory functions in the public interest.\n\t6\tYou notify the SRA promptly if:\n\t\t1\tyou are subject to any criminal charge, conviction or caution, subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974;\n\t\t2\ta relevant insolvency event occurs in relation to you;

These principles establish the standard\nof behaviour expected of a professional accountant. The fundamental principles are: integrity, objectivity,\nprofessional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour.\n\n2.\n\nThe Code provides a conceptual framework that professional accountants are to apply in order to\nidentify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. The Code sets out\nrequirements and application material on various topics to help accountants apply the conceptual\nframework to those topics.\n\n3.\n\nIn the case of audits, reviews and other assurance engagements, the Code sets out International\nIndependence Standards, established by the application of the conceptual framework to threats to\nindependence in relation to these engagements.\n\nHow the Code is Structured\n4.\n\nThe Code contains the following material:\n•\n\nPart 1 – Complying with the Code, Fundamental Principles and Conceptual Framework, which\nincludes the fundamental principles and the conceptual framework and is applicable to all\nprofessional accountants.\n\n•\n\nPart 2 – Professional Accountants in Business, which sets out additional material that applies to\nprofessional accountants in business when performing professional activities. Professional\naccountants in business include professional accountants employed, engaged or contracted in an\nexecutive or non-executive capacity in, for example:\no\n\nCommerce, industry or service.\n\no\n\nThe public sector.\n\no\n\nEducation.\n\no\n\nThe not-for-profit sector.\n\no\n\nRegulatory or professional bodies.\n\nPart 2 is also applicable to individuals who are professional accountants in public practice when\nperforming professional activities pursuant to their relationship with the firm, whether as a\ncontractor, employee or owner.\n\n5.\n\n•\n\nPart 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice, which sets out additional material that applies\nto professional accountants in public practice when providing professional services.\n\n•\n\nInternational Independence Standards, which sets out additional material that applies to\nprofessional accountants in public practice when providing assurance services, as follows:\no\n\nPart 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements, which applies when\nperforming audit or review engagements.\n\no\n\nPart 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review\nEngagements, which applies when performing assurance engagements that are not audit\nor review engagements.\n\n•\n\nPart 10-Insolvency. Insolvency Practitioners in the UK have to comply with the Insolvency Code. The\nInsolvency Code is currently part of the ICAEW Code but is set out in a separate document.\n\n•\n\nGlossary, which contains defined terms (together with additional explanations where appropriate) and\ndescribed terms which have a specific meaning in certain parts of the Code. For example, as noted\nin the Glossary, in Part 4A, the term “audit engagement” applies equally to both audit and review\nengagements. The Glossary also includes lists of abbreviations that are used in the Code and other\nstandards to which the Code refers.\n\nThe Code contains sections which address specific topics. Some sections contain subsections dealing\nGUIDE TO THE CODE Page 3 of 226\n\n\fwith specific aspects of those topics. Each section of the Code is structured, where appropriate, as\nfollows:\n•\n\nIntroduction – sets out the subject matter addressed within the section, and introduces the\nrequirements and application material in the context of the conceptual framework. Introductory\nmaterial contains information, including an explanation of terms used, which is important to the\nunderstanding and application of each Part and its sections.\n\n•\n\nRequirements – establish general and specific obligations with respect to the subject matter\naddressed.\n\n•\n\nApplication material – provides context, explanations, suggestions for actions or matters to\nconsider, illustrations and other guidance to assist in complying with the requirements.\n\nHow to Use the Code\nThe Fundamental Principles, Independence and Conceptual Framework\n6.\n\nThe Code requires professional accountants to comply with the fundamental principles of ethics. The\nCode also requires them to apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address threats to\ncompliance with the fundamental principles. Applying the conceptual framework requires having an\ninquiring mind, exercising professional judgement, and using the reasonable and informed third party\ntest.\n\n7.\n\nThe conceptual framework recognises that the existence of conditions, policies and procedures\nestablished by the profession, legislation, regulation, the firm, or the employing organisation might impact\nthe identification of threats. Those conditions, policies and procedures might also be a relevant factor in\nthe professional accountant’s evaluation of whether a threat is at an acceptable level. When threats are\nnot at an acceptable level, the conceptual framework requires the accountant to address those threats.\nApplying safeguards is one way that threats might be addressed. Safeguards are actions individually or\nin combination that the accountant takes that effectively reduce threats to an acceptable level.\n\n8.\n\nIn addition, the Code requires professional accountants to be independent when performing audit, review\nand other assurance engagements. The conceptual framework applies in the same way to identifying,\nevaluating and addressing threats to independence as to threats to compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples.\n\n9.\n\nComplying with the Code requires knowing, understanding and applying:\n•\n\nAll of the relevant provisions of a particular section in the context of Part 1, together with the\nadditional material set out in Sections 200, 300, 400 and 900, as applicable.\n\n•\n\nAll of the relevant provisions of a particular section, for example, applying the provisions that are\nset out under the subheadings titled “General” and “All Audit Clients” together with additional\nspecific provisions, including those set out under the subheadings titled “Audit Clients that are not\nPublic Interest Entities” or “Audit Clients that are Public Interest Entities.”\n\n•\n\nAll of the relevant provisions set out in a particular section together with any additional provisions\nset out in any relevant subsection.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\n10.\n\nRequirements and application material are to be read and applied with the objective of complying with\nthe fundamental principles, applying the conceptual framework and, when performing audit, review and\nother assurance engagements, being independent.\n\nRequirements\n11.\n\nRequirements are designated with the letter “R” and, in most cases, include the word “shall.” The word\n“shall” in the Code imposes an obligation on a professional accountant or firm to comply with the specific\nprovision in which “shall” has been used.\n\n12.\n\nIn some situations, the Code provides a specific exception to a requirement. In such a situation, the\nprovision is designated with the letter “R” but uses “may” or conditional wording.\n\n13.\n\nWhen the word “may” is used in the Code, it denotes permission to take a particular action in certain\ncircumstances, including as an exception to a requirement. It is not used to denote possibility.\n\n14.\n\nWhen the word “might” is used in the Code, it denotes the possibility of a matter arising, an event\noccurring or a course of action being taken. The term does not ascribe any particular level of possibility\nGUIDE TO THE CODE Page 4 of 226\n\n\for likelihood when used in conjunction with a threat, as the evaluation of the level of a threat depends\non the facts and circumstances of any particular matter, event or course of action.\nApplication Material\n15.\n\nIn addition to requirements, the Code contains application material that provides context relevant to a\nproper understanding of the Code. In particular, the application material is intended to help a professional\naccountant to understand how to apply the conceptual framework to a particular set of circumstances\nand to understand and comply with a specific requirement. While such application material does not of\nitself impose a requirement, consideration of the material is necessary to the proper application of the\nrequirements of the Code, including application of the conceptual framework. Application material is\ndesignated with the letter “A.”\n\n16.\n\nWhere application material includes lists of examples, these lists are not intended to be exhaustive.\n\nProfessional accountants who are in doubt as to their ethical position may seek advice from the following\nsources, available to all members of ICAEW:\n•\n\nICAEW’s Technical Advisory Services by phone +44 (0)1908 248 250 or webchat: Live web chat\n\n•\n\nThe ICAEW website also includes help sheets and answers to a number of frequently asked questions:\nTechnical Advisory Services helpsheets\n\n•\n\nThe Support Members Scheme which is run by volunteer members of the ICAEW from a wide range of\nbackgrounds. It is a confidential, free service exempt from the duty to report misconduct and provides\nsupport to members in difficulties. A member can contact the Support Members Scheme by phone on\n+44 (0)800 917 3526.\n\nBoth services are confidential and enquiries are treated in strict confidence by the advisors and volunteers,\nwho are exempt from the ICAEW duty to report misconduct. Hence details will not be divulged to third\nparties, including other departments of ICAEW, requested or consented to, except in cases where the\nProceeds of Crime Act 2002 applies.\n\nGUIDE TO THE

This\ndocument is set out here: Insolvency Code of Ethics) .................................................................210\nGLOSSARY, INCLUDING LISTS OF ABBREVIATIONS .............................................................................211\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS REFERRED TO IN THE CODE ........................................................................223\nLIST OF STANDARDS REFERRED TO IN THE CODE ...............................................................................224\n\nCONTENTS Page 8 of 226\n\n\fEFFECTIVE DATE\n\n225\n\nCONTENTS Page 9 of 226\n\n\fSECTION 1-SCOPE AND AUTHORITY\n(This Code of Ethics applies from 1 July 2025.)\nIntroduction\n1.1\n\nOne of the principal objects of the Royal Charter is to maintain a high standard of efficiency and\nprofessional conduct by members of ICAEW. The Code of Ethics (‘the Code’) applies to all members of\nICAEW (which for the purposes of the Code also includes affiliates, provisional members, foundation\nqualification holders, provisional foundation qualification holders and employees of a member firm or an\naffiliate) and member firms where relevant. These are referred to in the remainder of the Code as\nprofessional accountants.\n\nScope\nR1.2\n\nProfessional accountants shall follow the guidance contained in the fundamental principles and\nspecific requirements of the Code in all of their professional and business activities whether\ncarried out with or without reward and in other circumstances where to fail to do so would bring\ndiscredit to the profession.\n\n1.2A1\n\nFor convenience, the illustrations in the Code are grouped into parts applicable to professional\naccountants working in different spheres of activity. However, the specific requirements in any section,\napply where circumstances are the same as, or analogous to, those addressed by those requirements.\n\n1.2A2\n\nFailure to follow the specific requirements may be justified in those rare circumstances where to follow a\nprecise prohibition or mandated action would result in failure to adhere to the fundamental principles.\n\nR1.3\n\nProfessional accountants shall be guided not merely by the terms but also by the spirit of the Code\nand the fact that particular conduct does not appear among a list of examples does not prevent it\namounting to misconduct.\n\nR1.4\n\nProfessional accountants shall ensure that work for which they are responsible, which is\nundertaken by others on their behalf, is carried out in accordance with the requirements of this\nCode.\n\n1.4A1\n\nMember firms are reminded that this Code applies to their employees, whether members or not, and that\nthey are responsible for applying this requirement.\n\nAuthority\n1.5A1\n\nFailure to follow this Code may lead to a professional accountant becoming liable to disciplinary action as\noutlined in Disciplinary Bye-law 4,\n\n1.5A2\n\nIn determining whether or not a complaint is proved, the Conduct Committee and the Tribunal may have\nregard to any code of practice, ethical or technical, and to any regulations affecting professional\naccountants.\n\n1.5A3\n\nParagraph R120.3 requires professional accountants to apply the conceptual framework to identify,\nevaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. In the event of a complaint,\nthe Conduct Committee and the Tribunal will consider the matter, including whether a reasonable and\ninformed third party test would conclude, weighing all the specific facts and circumstances available to the\nprofessional accountant at that time, that compliance with the fundamental principles is compromised.\n\nRelationship with other requirements\n1.6A1\n\nExcept as noted below, the Code has been derived from the International Ethics Standards Board of\nAccountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics issued in August 2024. Accordingly, compliance with the remainder\nof the Code will ensure compliance with the principles of the IESBA Code. Paragraph numbering in the\nrest of this Code replicates that used in the IESBA Code of Ethics, except in respect of:\n•\n\nSections 1, 331 and Part 10 which have no direct equivalent in the IESBA Code of Ethics; and\n\nPREFACE Page 10 of 226\n\n\f•\n\nText in shaded boxes in the other sections, where additional discussion and/or requirements have\nbeen considered by ICAEW to be useful or necessary.\n\n1.6A2\n\nIn accordance with UK legislation, ICAEW has adopted, as regards auditor independence requirements,\nthe Ethical Standard for Auditors, issued by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). Therefore, when\nconducting audit engagements in accordance with ISAs (UK), and other public interest assurance\nengagements in the UK, professional accountants shall comply with the requirements of the FRC’s Ethical\nStandard for Auditors rather than the detailed provisions of part 4A of the Code. For other audit and\nassurance engagements part 4A may apply. This is explained in further detail in section 400.\n\n1.6A3\n\nCertain areas of work are reserved by statute to particular regulated individuals and firms, namely\ninvestment business, insolvency, audit and reserved legal services. In these areas professional\naccountants may be subject to rules laid down by laws and regulation, breach of which can give rise to\ndisciplinary proceedings against the professional accountant.\n\n1.6A4\n\nIf the requirements in the Code conflict with relevant laws and regulations, professional accountants are\nbound to follow the laws and regulations.\n\nSources of Guidance\n1.7.A1\n\nProfessional accountants who are in doubt as to their ethical position may seek advice from the following\nsources, available to all members of ICAEW:\n•\n\nICAEW’s Technical Advisory Services by phone +44 (0)1908 248 250 or webchat: Live web chat\nThe ICAEW website also includes help sheets and answers to a number of frequently asked\nquestions: Technical Advisory Services helpsheets\n\n•\n\nThe Support Members Scheme which is run by volunteer members of the ICAEW from a wide range\nof backgrounds.

Therefore, the Code contains requirements and application\nmaterial to enable professional accountants to meet their responsibility to act in the public\ninterest”.\nConfidence in the accountancy profession is a reason why businesses, governments and other\norganisations involve professional accountants in a broad range of areas, including financial and\ncorporate reporting, assurance and other professional activities. Accountants understand and\nacknowledge that such confidence is based on the skills and values that accountants bring to\nthe professional activities they undertake, including:\n(a)\n\nAdherence to ethical principles and professional standards;\n\n(b)\n\nUse of business acumen;\n\n(c)\n\nApplication of expertise on technical and other matters; and\n\n(d)\n\nExercise of professional judgement.\n\nThe application of these skills and values enables accountants to provide advice or other output\nthat meets the purpose for which it was provided, and which can be relied upon by the intended\nusers of such output.\n100.3\n\nThe Code sets out high quality standards of ethical behaviour expected of professional\naccountants for adoption by professional accountancy organisations which are members of the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC), or for use by such members as a basis for their\ncodes of ethics. The Code may also be used or adopted by those responsible for setting ethics\nstandards for professional accountants in particular sectors or jurisdictions and by firms in\ndeveloping their ethics and independence policies.\n\n100.4\n\nThe Code establishes five fundamental principles to be complied with by all professional\naccountants. It also includes a conceptual framework that sets out the approach to be taken to\nidentify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with those fundamental principles and, for\naudits and other assurance engagements, threats to independence. The Code also applies the\nfundamental principles and the conceptual framework to a range of facts and circumstances that\naccountants might encounter, whether in business or in public practice.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\n100.5 A1\n\nThe requirements in the Code, designated with the letter “R,” impose obligations.\n\n100.5 A2\n\nApplication material, designated with the letter “A,” provides context, explanations, suggestions\nfor actions or matters to consider, illustrations and other guidance relevant to a proper\nunderstanding of the Code. In particular, the application material is intended to help a\nprofessional accountant to understand how to apply the conceptual framework to a particular set\nof circumstances and to understand and comply with a specific requirement. While such\napplication material does not of itself impose a requirement, consideration of the material is\nnecessary to the proper application of the requirements of the Code, including application of the\nconceptual framework.\n\nSECTION 100 Page 13 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR100.6\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the Code.\n\n100.6 A1\n\nUpholding the fundamental principles and compliance with the specific requirements of the Code\nenable professional accountants to meet their responsibility to act in the public interest.\n\n100.6 A2\n\nComplying with the Code includes giving appropriate regard to the aim and intent of the specific\nrequirements.\n\n100.6 A3\n\nCompliance with the requirements of the Code does not mean that professional accountants will\nhave always met their responsibility to act in the public interest. There might be unusual or\nexceptional circumstances in which an accountant believes that complying with a requirement or\nrequirements of the Code might not be in the public interest or would lead to a disproportionate\noutcome. In those circumstances, the accountant is encouraged to consult with an appropriate\nbody such as a professional or regulatory body.\n\n100.6 A4\n\nIn acting in the public interest, a professional accountant considers not only the preferences or\nrequirements of an individual client or employing organisation, but also the interests of other\nstakeholders when performing professional activities.\n\nR100.7\n\nIf there are circumstances where laws or regulations preclude a professional accountant from\ncomplying with certain parts of the Code, those laws and regulations prevail, and the accountant\nshall comply with all other parts of the Code.\n\n100.7 A1\n\nThe principle of professional behaviour requires a professional accountant to comply with\nrelevant laws and regulations. Some jurisdictions might have provisions that differ from or go\nbeyond those set out in the Code. Accountants in those jurisdictions need to be aware of those\ndifferences and comply with the more stringent provisions unless prohibited by law or regulation.\n\nBreaches of the Code\nR100.8\n\n100.8 A1\n\nParagraphs R400.80 to R400.89 and R900.50 to R900.55 address a breach of International\nIndependence Standards. A professional accountant who identifies a breach of any other\nprovision of the Code shall evaluate the significance of the breach and its impact on the\naccountant’s ability to comply with the fundamental principles. The accountant shall also:\n(a)\n\nTake whatever actions might be available, as soon as possible, to address the\nconsequences of the breach satisfactorily; and\n\n(b)\n\nDetermine whether to report the breach to the relevant parties.\n\nRelevant parties to whom such a breach might be reported include those who might have been\naffected by it, a professional or regulatory body or an oversight authority.\n\nSECTION 100 Page 14 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 110\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES\nGeneral\n110.1 A1\n\nThere are five fundamental principles of ethics for professional accountants:\n(a)\n\nIntegrity – to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.\n\n(b)\n\nObjectivity – to exercise professional or business judgement without being compromised\nby:\n\n(c)\n\n(i)\n\nBias;\n\n(ii)\n\nConflict of interest; or\n\n(iii)\n\nUndue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or\nother factors.\n\nProfessional Competence and Due Care – to:\n(i)\n\nAttain and maintain professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure\nthat a client or employing organisation receives competent professional service,\nbased on current technical and professional standards and relevant legislation; and\n\n(ii)\n\nAct diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional\nstandards.\n\n(d)\n\nConfidentiality – to respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of\nprofessional and business relationships.\n\n(e)\n\nProfessional Behaviour – to:\n(i)\n\nComply with relevant laws and regulations;\n\n(ii)\n\nBehave in a manner consistent with the profession’s responsibility to act in the public\ninterest in all professional activities and business relationships; and\n\n(iii)\n\nAvoid any conduct that the professional accountant knows or should know might\ndiscredit the profession.\n\nR110.2\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with each of the fundamental principles.\n\n110.2 A1\n\nThe fundamental principles of ethics establish the standard of behaviour expected of a\nprofessional accountant. The conceptual framework establishes the approach which an\naccountant is required to apply in complying with those fundamental principles. Subsections 111\nto 115 set out requirements and application material related to each of the fundamental\nprinciples.\n\n110.2 A2\n\nA professional accountant might face a situation in which complying with one fundamental\nprinciple conflicts with complying with one or more other fundamental principles. In such a\nsituation, the accountant might consider consulting, on an anonymous basis if necessary, with:\n•\n\nOthers within the firm or employing organisation.\n\n•\n\nThose charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nA professional body.\n\n•\n\nA regulatory body.\n\n•\n\nLegal counsel.\n\nHowever, such consultation does not relieve the accountant from the responsibility to exercise\nprofessional judgement to resolve the conflict or, if necessary, and unless prohibited by law or\nregulation, disassociate from the matter creating the conflict.\n110.2 A3\n\nThe professional accountant is encouraged to document the substance of the issue, the details\nof any discussions, the decisions made and the rationale for those decisions.\n\nSECTION 110 Page 15 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSUBSECTION 111 – INTEGRITY\nR111.1\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the principle of integrity, which requires an\naccountant to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.\n\n111.1 A1\n\nIntegrity involves fair dealing, truthfulness and having the strength of character to act\nappropriately, even when facing pressure to do otherwise or when doing so might create potential\nadverse personal or organisational consequences.\n\n111.1 A2\n\nActing appropriately involves:\n(a)\n\nStanding one’s ground when confronted by dilemmas and difficult situations; or\n\n(b)\n\nChallenging others as and when circumstances warrant,\n\nin a manner appropriate to the circumstances.\nR111.2\n\nA professional accountant shall not knowingly be associated with reports, returns,\ncommunications or other information where the accountant believes that the information:\n(a)\n\nContains a materially false or misleading statement;\n\n(b)\n\nContains statements or information provided recklessly; or\n\n(c)\n\nOmits or obscures required information where such omission or obscurity would be\nmisleading.\n\n111.2 A1\n\nIf a professional accountant provides a modified report in respect of such a report, return,\ncommunication or other information, the accountant is not in breach of paragraph R111.2.\n\nR111.3\n\nWhen a professional accountant becomes aware of having been associated with information\ndescribed in paragraph R111.2, the accountant shall take steps to be disassociated from that\ninformation.\n\nSUBSECTION 112 – OBJECTIVITY\nR112.1\n\n112.1 A1\n\nR112.2\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the principle of objectivity, which requires an\naccountant to exercise professional or business judgement without being compromised by:\n(a)\n\nBias;\n\n(b)\n\nConflict of interest; or\n\n(c)\n\nUndue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or other\nfactors.\n\nObjectivity is the state of mind which has regard to all considerations relevant to the task in\nhand but no other.\nA professional accountant shall not undertake a professional activity if a circumstance or\nrelationship unduly influences the accountant’s professional judgement regarding that activity.\n\nSUBSECTION 113 – PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND DUE CARE\nR113.1\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the principle of professional competence and due\ncare, which requires an accountant to:\n(a)\n\nAttain and maintain professional knowledge and skills at the level required to ensure that a\nclient or employing organisation receives competent professional service, based on current\ntechnical and professional standards and relevant legislation; and\n\n(b)\n\nAct diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional standards.\n\n113.1 A1\n\nServing clients and employing organisations with professional competence involves the exercise\nof sound judgement in applying professional knowledge and skills.\n\n113.1 A2\n\nThe knowledge and skills necessary for a professional activity vary depending on the nature of\nthe activity being undertaken. For example, in addition to the application of any technical\nknowledge relevant to the professional activity, interpersonal, communication and organisational\nSECTION 110 Page 16 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nskills facilitate the professional accountant’s interaction with entities and individuals with whom\nthe accountant interacts.\n113.1 A3\n\nMaintaining professional competence requires a professional accountant to have a continuing\nawareness and understanding of technical, professional, business and technology-related\ndevelopments relevant to the professional activities undertaken by the accountant. Continuing\nprofessional development enables an accountant to develop and maintain the capabilities to\nperform competently within the professional environment.\n\n113.1 A4\n\nDiligence encompasses the responsibility to act in accordance with the requirements of an\nassignment, carefully, thoroughly and on a timely basis.\n\nR113.2\n\nIn complying with the principle of professional competence and due care, a professional\naccountant shall take reasonable steps to ensure that those working in a professional capacity\nunder the accountant’s authority have appropriate training and supervision.\n\nR113.3\n\nWhere appropriate, a professional accountant shall make clients, the employing organisation, or\nother users of the accountant’s professional activities, aware of the limitations inherent in the\nactivities and explain the implications of those limitations.\n\nSUBSECTION 114 – CONFIDENTIALITY\n114.0 A1\n\nR114.1\n\nThe principle of confidentiality is not only to keep information confidential, but also to take all\nreasonable steps to preserve confidentiality. Whether information is confidential or not will\ndepend on its nature. A safe and proper approach for professional accountants to adopt is to\nassume that all unpublished information about a client’s or employer’s affairs, however gained,\nis confidential. Some clients or employers may regard the mere fact of their relationship with a\nprofessional accountant as being confidential.\nA professional accountant shall comply with the principle of confidentiality, which requires an\naccountant to respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of professional and\nbusiness relationships. An accountant shall:\n(a)\n\nBe alert to the possibility of inadvertent disclosure, including in a social environment, and\nparticularly to a close business associate or an immediate or a close family member;\n\n(b)\n\nMaintain confidentiality of information within the firm or employing organisation;\n\n(c)\n\nMaintain confidentiality of information disclosed by a prospective client or employing\norganisation; and\n\n(d)\n\nTake reasonable steps to ensure that personnel under the accountant’s control, and\nindividuals from whom advice and assistance are obtained, comply with the accountant’s\nduty of confidentiality.\n\n114.1 A1\n\nMaintaining the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of professional and business\nrelationships involves the professional accountant taking appropriate action to protect the\nconfidentiality of such information in the course of its collection, use, transfer, storage or retention,\ndissemination and lawful destruction.\n\nR114.2\n\nSubject to paragraph R114.3, a professional accountant shall not:\n(a)\n\nDisclose confidential information acquired in the course of professional and business\nrelationships;\n\n(b)\n\nUse confidential information acquired in the course of professional and business\nrelationships for the advantage of the accountant, the firm, the employing organisation or\na third party;\n\n(c)\n\nUse or disclose any confidential information, either acquired or received in the course of a\nprofessional or business relationship, after that relationship has ended; and\n\n(d)\n\nUse or disclose information in respect of which the duty of confidentiality applies\nnotwithstanding that the information has become publicly available, whether properly or\nimproperly.\nSECTION 110 Page 17 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR114.3\n\n114.3 A1\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R114.2, a professional accountant may disclose or use confidential\ninformation where:\n(a)\n\nThere is a legal or professional duty or right to do so; or\n\n(b)\n\nThis is authorised by the client or any person with the authority to permit disclosure or use\nof the confidential information and this is not prohibited by law or regulation.\n\nConfidentiality serves the public interest because it facilitates the free flow of information from\nthe professional accountant’s client or employing organisation to the accountant in the\nknowledge that the information will not be disclosed to a third party. Nevertheless, the following\nare circumstances where professional accountants might be required or have the duty or right to\ndisclose confidential information:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n114.3 A2\n\n114.3 A3\n\nDisclosure is required by law or regulation, for example:\n(i)\n\nProduction of documents or other provision of evidence in the course of legal\nproceedings; or\n\n(ii)\n\nDisclosure to the appropriate public authorities of infringements of the law that come\nto light; and\n\nThere is a professional duty or right to disclose or use, when not prohibited by law or\nregulation:\n(i)\n\nTo comply with the quality review of a professional body;\n\n(ii)\n\nTo respond to an inquiry or investigation by a professional or regulatory body;\n\n(iii)\n\nTo protect the professional interests of a professional accountant in legal\nproceedings; or\n\n(iv)\n\nTo comply with technical and professional standards, including ethics requirements.\n\nIn deciding whether to disclose or use confidential information, factors to consider, depending on\nthe circumstances, include:\n•\n\nWhether the interests of any parties, including third parties whose interests might be\naffected, could be harmed if the client or employing organisation authorises the disclosure\nor use of information by the professional accountant.\n\n•\n\nWhether all the relevant information is known and substantiated, to the extent practicable.\nFactors affecting the decision to disclose or use the information include:\no\n\nUnsubstantiated facts.\n\no\n\nIncomplete information.\n\no\n\nUnsubstantiated conclusions.\n\n•\n\nThe proposed means of communicating the information.\n\n•\n\nWhether the parties to whom the information is to be provided or access is to be granted\nare appropriate recipients.\n\n•\n\nAny applicable law or regulation (including those governing privacy) in a jurisdiction where\ndisclosure might take place and, if different, the jurisdiction where the confidential\ninformation originates.\n\nThe circumstances in which a firm or employing organisation seeks authorisation to use or\ndisclose confidential information, include where the information is to be used for training\npurposes, in the development of products or technology, in research or as source material for\nindustry or other benchmarking data or studies. Such authorisation might be general in its\napplication (for example, in relation to use of the information for internal training purposes or\nquality enhancement initiatives). When obtaining the authorisation of the individual or entity that\nprovided such information for use in specific circumstances, relevant considerations to be\ncommunicated (preferably in writing) might include:\n•\n\nThe nature of the information to be used or disclosed.\n\n•\n\nThe purpose for which the information is to be used or disclosed (for example, technology\ndevelopment, research or benchmarking data or studies).\n\nSECTION 110 Page 18 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR114.4\n\n114.2 A1\n\n•\n\nThe individual or entity who will undertake the activity for which the information is to be\nused or disclosed.\n\n•\n\nWhether the identity of the individual or entity that provided such information or any\nindividuals or entities to which such information relates will be identifiable from the output\nof the activity for which the information is to be used or disclosed.\n\nA professional accountant shall continue to comply with the principle of confidentiality even after\nthe end of the relationship between the accountant and a client or employing organisation. When\nchanging employment or acquiring a new client, the accountant is entitled to use prior experience\nbut shall not use or disclose any confidential information acquired or received in the course of a\nprofessional or business relationship.\nThis requirement extends not only to clients, past and present, but also to third parties from or\nabout whom information has been received in confidence. The principle of confidentiality clearly\ndoes not prevent an employee from using the skills acquired while working with a former\nemployer in undertaking a new role with a different organisation. It would not be appropriate\nfor professional accountants to either use or appear to use special knowledge which could only\nhave been acquired with access to confidential information. It is a matter of judgement as to\nthe dividing line which separates experience gained from special knowledge acquired.\n\nSUBSECTION 115 – PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR\nR115.1\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the principle of professional behaviour, which\nrequires an accountant to:\n(a)\n\nComply with relevant laws and regulations;\n\n(b)\n\nBehave in a manner consistent with the profession’s responsibility to act in the public\ninterest in all professional activities and business relationships; and\n\n(c)\n\nAvoid any conduct that the accountant knows or should know might discredit the\nprofession.\n\nA professional accountant shall not knowingly engage in any business, occupation or activity that\nimpairs or might impair the integrity, objectivity or good reputation of the profession, and as a\nresult would be incompatible with the fundamental principles.\n115.1 A1\n\n115.1 A2\n\nR115.2\n\nConduct that might discredit the profession includes conduct that a reasonable and informed third\nparty would be likely to conclude adversely affects the good reputation of the profession.\nA reasonable and informed third party would expect that a professional accountant, in\ntheir professional life, treats others fairly, with respect and dignity and, for example,\ndoes not bully, harass, victimise or unfairly discriminate against others.\nWhen undertaking marketing or promotional activities, a professional accountant shall not bring\nthe profession into disrepute. A professional accountant shall be honest and truthful and shall\nnot make:\n(a)\n\nExaggerated claims for the services offered by, or the qualifications or experience of, the\naccountant; or\n\n(b)\n\nDisparaging references or unsubstantiated comparisons to the work of others.\n\n115.2 A1\n\nIf a professional accountant is in doubt about whether a form of advertising or marketing is\nappropriate, the accountant is encouraged to consult with the relevant professional body.\n\nR115.3\n\nProfessional accountants shall never promote or seek to promote their services, or the\nservices of other professional accountants, in such a way, or to such an extent, as to\namount to harassment of a potential client or employer.\n\nSECTION 110 Page 19 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 120\nTHE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\nIntroduction\n120.1\n\nThe circumstances in which professional accountants operate might create threats to compliance\nwith the fundamental principles. Section 120 sets out requirements and application material,\nincluding a conceptual framework, to assist accountants in complying with the fundamental\nprinciples and meeting their responsibility to act in the public interest. Such requirements and\napplication material accommodate the wide range of facts and circumstances, including the\nvarious professional activities, interests and relationships, that create threats to compliance with\nthe fundamental principles. In addition, they deter accountants from concluding that a situation\nis permitted solely because that situation is not specifically prohibited by the Code.\n\n120.2\n\nThe conceptual framework specifies an approach for a professional accountant to:\n(a)\n\nIdentify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles;\n\n(b)\n\nEvaluate the threats identified; and\n\n(c)\n\nAddress the threats by eliminating or reducing them to an acceptable level.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR120.3\n\nThe professional accountant shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and\naddress threats to compliance with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110.\n\n120.3 A1\n\nAdditional requirements and application material that are relevant to the application of the\nconceptual framework are set out in:\n(a)\n\nPart 2 – Professional Accountants in Business;\n\n(b)\n\nPart 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice; and\n\n(c)\n\nInternational Independence Standards, as follows:\n\n(d)\n\n(i)\n\nPart 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements; and\n\n(ii)\n\nPart 4B – Independence for assurance engagements Other than Audit and Review\nEngagements.\n\nPart 10-Insolvency.\n\nR120.4\n\nWhen dealing with an ethics issue, the professional accountant shall consider the context in\nwhich the issue has arisen or might arise. Where an individual who is a professional accountant\nin public practice is performing professional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship\nwith the firm, whether as a contractor, employee or owner, the individual shall comply with the\nprovisions in Part 2 that apply to these circumstances.\n\nR120.5\n\nWhen applying the conceptual framework, the professional accountant shall:\n(a)\n\nHave an inquiring mind;\n\n(b)\n\nExercise professional judgement; and\n\n(c)\n\nUse the reasonable and informed third party test described in paragraph 120.5 A9.\n\nHaving an Inquiring Mind\n120.5 A1\n\nAn inquiring mind is a prerequisite to obtaining an understanding of known facts and\ncircumstances necessary for the proper application of the conceptual framework. Having an\ninquiring mind involves:\n(a)\n\nConsidering the source, relevance and sufficiency of information obtained, taking into\naccount the nature, scope and outputs of the professional activity being undertaken; and\n\n(b)\n\nBeing open and alert to a need for further investigation or other action.\n\nSECTION 120 Page 20 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n120.5 A2\n\n120.5 A3\n\nWhen considering the source, relevance and sufficiency of information obtained, the professional\naccountant might consider, among other matters, whether:\n•\n\nNew information has emerged or there have been changes in facts and circumstances.\n\n•\n\nThe information or its source might be influenced by bias or self-interest.\n\n•\n\nThere is reason to be concerned that potentially relevant information might be missing from\nthe facts and circumstances known to the accountant.\n\n•\n\nThere is an inconsistency between the known facts and circumstances and the\naccountant’s expectations.\n\n•\n\nThe information provides a reasonable basis on which to reach a conclusion.\n\n•\n\nThere might be other reasonable conclusions that could be reached from the information\nobtained.\n\nParagraph R120.5 requires all professional accountants to have an inquiring mind when\nidentifying, evaluating and addressing threats to the fundamental principles. This prerequisite for\napplying the conceptual framework applies to all accountants regardless of the professional\nactivity undertaken. Under auditing, review and other assurance standards, including those\nissued by the IAASB, accountants are also required to exercise professional scepticism, which\nincludes a critical assessment of evidence.\n\nExercising Professional Judgement\n120.5 A4\n\nProfessional judgement involves the application of relevant training, professional knowledge, skill\nand experience commensurate with the facts and circumstances, taking into account the nature\nand scope of the particular professional activities, and the interests and relationships involved.\n\n120.5 A5\n\nProfessional judgement is required when the professional accountant applies the conceptual\nframework in order to make informed decisions about the courses of actions available, and to\ndetermine whether such decisions are appropriate in the circumstances. In making this\ndetermination, the accountant might consider matters such as whether:\n•\n\nThe accountant’s expertise and experience are sufficient to reach a conclusion.\n\n•\n\nThere is a need to consult with others with relevant expertise or experience.\n\n•\n\nThe accountant’s own preconception or bias might be affecting the accountant’s exercise\nof professional judgement.\n\n120.5 A6\n\nThe circumstances in which professional accountants carry out professional activities and the\nfactors involved vary considerably in their range and complexity. The professional judgement\nexercised by accountants might need to take into account the complexity arising from the\ncompounding effect of the interaction between, and changes in, elements of the facts and\ncircumstances that are uncertain and variables and assumptions that are interconnected or\ninterdependent.\n\n120.5 A7\n\nManaging complexity involves:\n•\n\n•\n\n120.5 A8\n\nMaking the firm or employing organisation and, if appropriate, relevant stakeholders aware\nof the inherent uncertainties or difficulties arising from the facts and circumstances. (Ref:\nPara. R113.3)\nBeing alert to any developments or changes in the facts and circumstances and assessing\nwhether they might impact any judgements the accountant has made. (Ref: Para. R120.5\nto 120.5 A3, and R120.9 to 120.9 A2)\n\nManaging complexity might also involve:\n•\n•\n•\n\nAnalysing and investigating as relevant, any uncertain elements, the variables and\nassumptions and how they are connected or interdependent.\nUsing technology to analyse relevant data to inform the professional accountant’s\njudgement.\nConsulting with others, including experts, to ensure appropriate challenge and additional\ninput as part of the evaluation process.\n\nSECTION 120 Page 21 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nReasonable and Informed Third Party\n120.5 A9\n\nThe reasonable and informed third party test is a consideration by the professional accountant\nabout whether the same conclusions would likely be reached by another party. Such\nconsideration is made from the perspective of a reasonable and informed third party, who weighs\nall the relevant facts and circumstances that the accountant knows, or could reasonably be\nexpected to know, at the time the conclusions are made. The reasonable and informed third party\ndoes not need to be an accountant, but would possess the relevant knowledge and experience\nto understand and evaluate the appropriateness of the accountant’s conclusions in an impartial\nmanner.\n\nIdentifying Threats\nR120.6\n\nThe professional accountant shall identify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\n120.6 A1\n\nAn understanding of the facts and circumstances, including any professional activities, interests\nand relationships that might compromise compliance with the fundamental principles, is a\nprerequisite to the professional accountant’s identification of threats to such compliance. The\nexistence of certain conditions, policies and procedures established by the profession,\nlegislation, regulation, the firm, or the employing organisation that can enhance the accountant\nacting ethically might also help identify threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\nParagraph 120.8 A2 includes general examples of such conditions, policies and procedures\nwhich are also factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats.\n\n120.6 A2\n\nThreats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts\nand circumstances. It is not possible to define every situation that creates threats. In addition,\nthe nature of engagements and work assignments might differ and, consequently, different types\nof threats might be created.\n\n120.6 A3\n\nThreats to compliance with the fundamental principles fall into one or more of the following\ncategories:\n\n120.6 A4\n\n(a)\n\nSelf-interest threat – the threat that a financial or other interest will inappropriately influence\na professional accountant’s judgement or behaviour;\n\n(b)\n\nSelf-review threat – the threat that a professional accountant will not appropriately evaluate\nthe results of a previous judgement made, or an activity performed by the accountant or\nby another individual within the accountant’s firm or employing organisation, on which the\naccountant will rely when forming a judgement as part of performing a current activity;\n\n(c)\n\nAdvocacy threat – the threat that a professional accountant will promote a client’s or\nemploying organisation’s position to the point that the accountant’s objectivity is\ncompromised;\n\n(d)\n\nFamiliarity threat – the threat that due to a long or close relationship with a client, or\nemploying organisation, a professional accountant will be too sympathetic to their interests\nor too accepting of their work; and\n\n(e)\n\nIntimidation threat – the threat that a professional accountant will be deterred from acting\nobjectively because of actual or perceived pressures, including attempts to exercise undue\ninfluence over the accountant.\n\nA circumstance might create more than one threat, and a threat might affect compliance with\nmore than one fundamental principle.\n\nEvaluating Threats\nR120.7\n\nWhen the professional accountant identifies a threat to compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples, the accountant shall evaluate whether such a threat is at an acceptable level.\n\nAcceptable level\n120.7 A1\n\nAn acceptable level is a level at which a professional accountant using the reasonable and\ninformed third party test would likely conclude that the accountant complies with the fundamental\nprinciples.\n\nSECTION 120 Page 22 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nFactors Relevant in Evaluating the Level of Threats\n120.8 A1\n\nThe consideration of qualitative as well as quantitative factors is relevant in the professional\naccountant’s evaluation of threats, as is the combined effect of multiple threats, if applicable.\n\n120.8 A2\n\nThe existence of conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraph 120.6 A1 might also\nbe factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats to compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples. Examples of such conditions, policies and procedures include:\n•\n\nCorporate governance requirements.\n\n•\n\nEducational, training and experience requirements for the profession.\n\n•\n\nEffective complaint systems which enable the professional accountant and the general\npublic to draw attention to unethical behaviour.\n\n•\n\nAn explicitly stated duty to report breaches of ethics requirements.\n\n•\n\nProfessional or regulatory monitoring and disciplinary procedures.\n\nConsideration of New Information or Changes in Facts and Circumstances\nR120.9\n\nIf the professional accountant becomes aware of new information or changes in facts and\ncircumstances that might impact whether a threat has been eliminated or reduced to an\nacceptable level, the accountant shall re-evaluate and address that threat accordingly.\n\n120.9 A1\n\nRemaining alert throughout the professional activity assists the professional accountant in\ndetermining whether new information has emerged or changes in facts and circumstances have\noccurred that:\n\n120.9 A2\n\n(a)\n\nImpact the level of a threat; or\n\n(b)\n\nAffect the accountant’s conclusions about whether safeguards applied continue to be\nappropriate to address identified threats.\n\nIf new information results in the identification of a new threat, the professional accountant is\nrequired to evaluate and, as appropriate, address this threat. (Ref: Paras. R120.7 and R120.10).\n\nAddressing Threats\nR120.10\n\nIf the professional accountant determines that the identified threats to compliance with the\nfundamental principles are not at an acceptable level, the accountant shall address the threats\nby eliminating them or reducing them to an acceptable level. The accountant shall do so by:\n(a)\n\nEliminating the circumstances, including interests or relationships, that are creating the\nthreats;\n\n(b)\n\nApplying safeguards, where available and capable of being applied, to reduce the threats\nto an acceptable level; or\n\n(c)\n\nDeclining or ending the specific professional activity.\n\nActions to Eliminate Threats\n120.10 A1\n\nDepending on the facts and circumstances, a threat might be addressed by eliminating the\ncircumstance creating the threat. However, there are some situations in which threats can only be\naddressed by declining or ending the specific professional activity. This is because the\ncircumstances that created the threats cannot be eliminated and safeguards are not capable of\nbeing applied to reduce the threat to an acceptable level.\n\nSafeguards\n120.10 A2\n\nSafeguards are actions, individually or in combination, that the professional accountant takes\nthat effectively reduce threats to compliance with the fundamental principles to an acceptable\nlevel.\n\nConsideration of Significant Judgements Made and Overall Conclusions Reached\nR120.11\n\nThe professional accountant shall form an overall conclusion about whether the actions that the\naccountant takes, or intends to take, to address the threats created will eliminate those threats or\nreduce them to an acceptable level. In forming the overall conclusion, the accountant shall:\n(a)\n\nReview any significant judgements made or conclusions reached; and\nSECTION 120 Page 23 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(b)\n\nUse the reasonable and informed third party test.\n\nOther Considerations when Applying the Conceptual Framework\nBias\n120.12 A1\n\nConscious or unconscious bias affects the exercise of professional judgement when identifying,\nevaluating and addressing threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\n120.12 A2\n\nExamples of potential bias to be aware of when exercising professional judgement include:\n\n120.12 A3\n\n•\n\nAnchoring bias, which is a tendency to use an initial piece of information as an anchor\nagainst which subsequent information is inadequately assessed.\n\n•\n\nAutomation bias, which is a tendency to favour output generated from automated systems,\neven when human reasoning or contradictory information raises questions as to whether\nsuch output is reliable or fit for purpose.\n\n•\n\nAvailability bias, which is a tendency to place more weight on events or experiences that\nimmediately come to mind or are readily available than on those that are not.\n\n•\n\nConfirmation bias, which is a tendency to place more weight on information that\ncorroborates an existing belief than information that contradicts or casts doubt on that\nbelief.\n\n•\n\nGroupthink, which is a tendency for a group of individuals to discourage individual creativity\nand responsibility and as a result reach a decision without critical reasoning or\nconsideration of alternatives.\n\n•\n\nOverconfidence bias, which is a tendency to overestimate one’s own ability to make\naccurate assessments of risk or other judgements or decisions.\n\n•\n\nRepresentation bias, which is a tendency to base an understanding on a pattern of\nexperiences, events or beliefs that is assumed to be representative.\n\n•\n\nSelective perception, which is a tendency for a person’s expectations to influence how the\nperson views a particular matter or person.\n\nActions that might mitigate the effect of bias include:\n•\n\nSeeking advice from experts to obtain additional input.\n\n•\n\nConsulting with others to ensure appropriate challenge as part of the evaluation process.\n\n•\n\nReceiving training related to the identification of bias as part of professional development.\n\nOrganisational Culture\n120.13 A1\n\nThe effective application of the conceptual framework by a professional accountant is enhanced\nwhen the importance of ethical values that align with the fundamental principles and other\nprovisions set out in the Code is promoted through the internal culture of the accountant’s\norganisation.\n\n120.13 A2\n\nThe promotion of an ethical culture within an organisation is most effective when:\n\n120.13 A3\n\n(a)\n\nLeaders and those in managerial roles promote the importance of, and hold themselves\nand others accountable for demonstrating, the ethical values of the organisation;\n\n(b)\n\nAppropriate education and training programmes, management processes, and\nperformance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an ethical culture are in place;\n\n(c)\n\nEffective policies and procedures are in place to encourage and protect those who report\nactual or suspected illegal or unethical behaviour, including whistle-blowers; and\n\n(d)\n\nThe organisation adheres to ethical values in its dealings with third parties.\n\nProfessional accountants are expected to:\n(a)\n\nEncourage and promote an ethics-based culture in their organisation, taking into account\ntheir position and seniority; and\n\n(b)\n\nExhibit ethical behaviour in dealings with individuals with whom, and entities with which,\nthe accountants, the firm or the employing organisation has a professional or business\nrelationship.\nSECTION 120 Page 24 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nConsiderations for Audits, Reviews, Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements\nFirm Culture\n120.14 A1\n\nISQM 1 sets out requirements and application material relating to firm culture in the context of a\nfirm’s responsibilities to design, implement and operate a system of quality management for\naudits or reviews of financial statements, or other assurance or related services engagements.\n\nIndependence\n120. 15 A1\n\nProfessional accountants in public practice are required by International Independence\nStandards to be independent when performing audits, reviews, or other assurance engagements.\nIndependence is linked to the fundamental principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:\n(a)\n\nIndependence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion\nwithout being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby\nallowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional\nscepticism.\n\n(b)\n\nIndependence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so\nsignificant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a\nfirm’s or an audit or assurance team member’s integrity, objectivity or professional\nscepticism has been compromised.\n\n120.15 A2\n\nInternational Independence Standards set out requirements and application material on how to\napply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when performing audits, reviews or\nother assurance engagements. Professional accountants and firms are required to comply with\nthese standards in order to be independent when conducting such engagements. The conceptual\nframework to identify, evaluate and address threats to compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples applies in the same way to compliance with independence requirements. The\ncategories of threats to compliance with the fundamental principles described in paragraph 120.6\nA3 are also the categories of threats to compliance with independence requirements.\n\n120.15 A3\n\nConditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 that might\nassist in identifying and evaluating threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might\nalso be factors relevant to identifying and evaluating threats to independence. In the context of\naudits, reviews and other assurance engagements, a system of quality management designed,\nimplemented and operated by a firm in accordance with the quality management standards\nissued by the IAASB is an example of such conditions, policies and procedures.\n\nProfessional Scepticism\n120.16 A1\n\nUnder auditing, review and other assurance standards, including those issued by the IAASB,\nprofessional accountants in public practice are required to exercise professional scepticism when\nplanning and performing audits, reviews and other assurance engagements. Professional\nscepticism and the fundamental principles that are described in Section 110 are inter-related\nconcepts.\n\n120.16 A2\n\nIn an audit of financial statements, compliance with the fundamental principles, individually and\ncollectively, supports the exercise of professional scepticism, as shown in the following\nexamples:\n•\n\nIntegrity requires the professional accountant to be straightforward and honest. For\nexample, the accountant complies with the principle of integrity by:\no\n\nBeing straightforward and honest when raising concerns about a position taken by\na client.\n\no\n\nPursuing inquiries about inconsistent information and seeking further audit evidence\nto address concerns about statements that might be materially false or misleading\nin order to make informed decisions about the appropriate course of action in the\ncircumstances.\n\no\n\nHaving the strength of character to act appropriately, even when facing pressure to\ndo otherwise or when doing so might create potential adverse personal or\norganisational consequences. Acting appropriately involves:\n(a)\n\nStanding one’s ground when confronted by dilemmas and difficult situations;\nor\nSECTION 120 Page 25 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(b)\n\nChallenging others as and when circumstances warrant,\n\nin a manner appropriate to the circumstances.\nIn doing so, the accountant demonstrates the critical assessment of audit evidence that\ncontributes to the exercise of professional scepticism.\n•\n\nObjectivity requires the professional accountant to exercise professional or business\njudgement without being compromised by:\n(a)\n\nBias;\n\n(b)\n\nConflict of interest; or\n\n(c)\n\nUndue influence of, or undue reliance on, individuals, organisations, technology or\nother factors.\n\nFor example, the accountant complies with the principle of objectivity by:\n(a)\n\nRecognising circumstances or relationships such as familiarity with the client, that\nmight compromise the accountant’s professional or business judgement; and\n\n(b)\n\nConsidering the impact of such circumstances and relationships on the accountant’s\njudgement when evaluating the sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence\nrelated to a matter material to the client’s financial statements.\n\nIn doing so, the accountant behaves in a manner that contributes to the exercise of\nprofessional scepticism.\n•\n\nProfessional competence and due care requires the professional accountant to have\nprofessional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure the provision of competent\nprofessional service, and to act diligently in accordance with applicable standards, laws and\nregulations. For example, the accountant complies with the principle of professional\ncompetence and due care by:\n(a)\n\nApplying knowledge that is relevant to a particular client’s industry and business\nactivities in order to properly identify risks of material misstatement;\n\n(b)\n\nDesigning and performing appropriate audit procedures; and\n\n(c)\n\nApplying relevant knowledge when critically assessing whether audit evidence is\nsufficient and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nIn doing so, the accountant behaves in a manner that contributes to the exercise of\nprofessional scepticism.\n\nSECTION 120 Page 26 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPART 2 – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN BUSINESS\n\nSection 200\n\nApplying the Conceptual Framework – Professional Accountants in Business ........................28\n\nSection 210\n\nConflicts of Interest ....................................................................................................................32\n\nSection 220\n\nPreparation and Presentation of Information .............................................................................34\n\nSection 230\n\nActing with Sufficient Expertise ..................................................................................................38\n\nSection 240 Financial Interests, Compensation and Incentives Linked to\nFinancial Reporting and Decision Making ...............................................................................................39\nSection 250\n\nInducements, Including Gifts and Hospitality .............................................................................40\n\nSection 260\n\nResponding to Non-compliance with Laws and Regulations .....................................................44\n\nSection 270\n\nPressure to Breach the Fundamental Principles .......................................................................51\n\nPART 2 – CONTENTS Page 27 of 226\n\nPART 2\n\nPage\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPART 2 - PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN BUSINESS\nSECTION 200\nAPPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN\nBUSINESS\nIntroduction\n200.1\n\nThis Part of the Code sets out requirements and application material for professional accountants in\nbusiness when applying the conceptual framework set out in Section 120. It does not describe all of\nthe facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that could\nbe encountered by professional accountants in business, which create or might create threats to\ncompliance with the fundamental principles. Therefore, the conceptual framework requires\nprofessional accountants in business to be alert for such facts and circumstances.\n\n200.2\n\nInvestors, creditors, employing organisations and other sectors of the business community, as\nwell as governments and the general public, might rely on the work of professional accountants\nin business. professional accountants in business might be solely or jointly responsible for the\npreparation and reporting of financial and other information, on which both their employing\norganisations and third parties might rely. They might also be responsible for providing effective\nfinancial management and competent advice on a variety of business-related matters.\n\n200.3\n\nA professional accountant in business might be an employee, contractor, partner, director\n(executive or non-executive), owner-manager, or volunteer of an employing organisation. The\nlegal form of the relationship of the accountant with the employing organisation has no bearing\non the ethical responsibilities placed on the accountant.\n\n200.4\n\nIn this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to:\n(a)\n\nA professional accountant in business; and\n\n(b)\n\nAn individual who is a professional accountant in public practice when performing\nprofessional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship with the accountant’s firm,\nwhether as a contractor, employee or owner. More information on when Part 2 is applicable\nto professional accountants in public practice is set out in paragraphs R120.4, R300.5 and\n300.5 A1.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR200.5\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110\nand apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address\nthreats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\n200.5 A1\n\nA professional accountant has a responsibility to further the legitimate objectives of the\naccountant’s employing organisation. The Code does not seek to hinder accountants from\nfulfilling that responsibility, but addresses circumstances in which compliance with the\nfundamental principles might be compromised.\n\n200.5 A2\n\nProfessional accountants may promote the position of the employing organisation when\nfurthering the legitimate goals and objectives of their employing organisation, provided that any\nstatements made are neither false nor misleading. Such actions usually would not create an\nadvocacy threat.\n\n200.5 A3\n\nThe more senior the position of a professional accountant, the greater will be the ability and\nopportunity to access information, and to influence policies, decisions made and actions taken\nby others involved with the employing organisation. To the extent that they are able to do so,\ntaking into account their position and seniority in the organisation, accountants are expected to\nencourage and promote an ethics-based culture in the organisation and exhibit ethical behaviour\nin dealings with individuals with whom, and entities with which, the accountant or the employing\norganisation has a professional or business relationship in accordance with paragraph 120.13\nA3. Examples of actions that might be taken include the introduction, implementation and\noversight of:\n•\n\nEthics education and training programmes.\n\nSECTION 200 Page 28 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nManagement processes and performance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an\nethical culture.\n\n•\n\nEthics and whistle-blowing policies.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures designed to prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nIdentifying Threats\n200.6 A1\n\nThreats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts\nand circumstances. The categories of threats are described in paragraph 120.6 A3. The following\nare examples of facts and circumstances within each of those categories that might create threats\nfor a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nSelf-interest Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant holding a financial interest in, or receiving a loan or\nguarantee from, the employing organisation.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant participating in incentive compensation arrangements\noffered by the employing organisation.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having access to corporate assets for personal use.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant being offered a gift or special treatment from a supplier of\nthe employing organisation.\n\nSelf-review Threats\n•\n\n(c)\n\nAdvocacy Threats\n•\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nA professional accountant determining the appropriate accounting treatment for a\nbusiness combination after performing the feasibility study supporting the purchase\ndecision.\n\nA professional accountant having the opportunity to manipulate information in a\nprospectus in order to obtain favourable financing.\n\nFamiliarity Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant being responsible for the financial reporting of the\nemploying organisation when an immediate or close family member employed by\nthe organisation makes decisions that affect the financial reporting of the\norganisation.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having a long association with individuals influencing\nbusiness decisions.\n\nIntimidation Threats\n•\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant or immediate or close family member facing the threat of\ndismissal or replacement over a disagreement about:\no\n\nThe application of an accounting principle.\n\no\n\nThe way in which financial information is to be reported.\n\nAn individual attempting to influence the decision-making process of the professional\naccountant, for example with regard to the awarding of contracts or the application\nof an accounting principle.\n\nIdentifying Threats Associated with the Use of Technology\n200.6 A2\n\nThe following are examples of facts and circumstances relating to the use of technology that\nmight create threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:\n•\n\nSelf-interest Threats\no\nThe data available might not be sufficient for the effective use of the technology.\no\nThe technology might not be appropriate for the purpose for which it is to be used.\n\nSECTION 200 Page 29 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\no\n\nThe accountant might not have sufficient information and expertise, or access to an\nexpert with sufficient understanding, to use and explain the technology and its\nappropriateness for the purpose intended.\n\n(Ref: Para. 230.2).\n•\n\nSelf-review Threats\no\n\nThe technology was designed or developed using the knowledge, expertise or\njudgement of the accountant or employing organisation.\n\nEvaluating Threats\n200.7 A1\n\nThe conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 might\nimpact the evaluation of whether a threat to compliance with the fundamental principles is at an\nacceptable level.\n\n200.7 A2\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat is also impacted by the nature\nand scope of the professional activity.\n\n200.7 A3\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by the work\nenvironment within the employing organisation and its operating environment. For example:\n\n200.7 A4\n\n200.7 A5\n\n•\n\nLeadership that stresses the importance of ethical behaviour and the expectation that\nemployees will act in an ethical manner.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures to empower and encourage employees to communicate ethics\nissues that concern them to senior levels of management without fear of retribution.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures to implement and monitor the quality of employee performance.\n\n•\n\nSystems of corporate oversight or other oversight structures and strong internal controls.\n\n•\n\nRecruitment procedures emphasising the importance of employing high calibre competent\npersonnel.\n\n•\n\nTimely communication of policies and procedures, including any changes to them, to all\nemployees, and appropriate training and education on such policies and procedures.\n\n•\n\nEthics and code of conduct policies.\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat associated with the use of\ntechnology might also be impacted by the work environment within the employing organisation\nand its operating environment. For example:\n•\n\nLevel of corporate oversight and internal controls over the technology.\n\n•\n\nAssessments of the quality and functionality of technology that are undertaken by a thirdparty.\n\n•\n\nTraining that is provided regularly to all relevant employees so they obtain and maintain\nthe professional competence to sufficiently understand, use and explain the technology\nand its appropriateness for the purpose intended.\n\nProfessional accountants might consider obtaining legal advice where they believe that unethical\nbehaviour or actions by others have occurred, or will continue to occur, within the employing\norganisation.\n\nAddressing Threats\n200.8 A1\n\nSections 210 to 270 describe certain threats that might arise during the course of performing\nprofessional activities and include examples of actions that might address such threats.\n\n200.8 A2\n\nIn extreme situations, if the circumstances that created the threats cannot be eliminated and\nsafeguards are not available or capable of being applied to reduce the threat to an acceptable\nlevel, it might be appropriate for a professional accountant to resign from the employing\norganisation.\n\nCommunicating with Those Charged with Governance\nR200.9\n\nWhen communicating with those charged with governance in accordance with the Code, a\nprofessional accountant shall determine the appropriate individual(s) within the employing\nSECTION 200 Page 30 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\norganisation’s governance structure with whom to communicate. If the accountant communicates\nwith a subgroup of those charged with governance, the accountant shall determine whether\ncommunication with all of those charged with governance is also necessary so that they are\nadequately informed.\n200.9 A1\n\nIn determining with whom to communicate, a professional accountant might consider:\n(a)\n\nThe nature and importance of the circumstances; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe matter to be communicated.\n\n200.9 A2\n\nExamples of a subgroup of those charged with governance include an audit committee or an\nindividual member of those charged with governance.\n\nR200.10\n\nIf a professional accountant communicates with individuals who have management\nresponsibilities as well as governance responsibilities, the accountant shall be satisfied that\ncommunication with those individuals adequately informs all of those in a governance role with\nwhom the accountant would otherwise communicate.\n\n200.10 A1\n\nIn some circumstances, all of those charged with governance are involved in managing the\nemploying organisation, for example, a small business where a single owner manages the\norganisation and no one else has a governance role. In these cases, if matters are communicated\nwith individual(s) with management responsibilities, and those individual(s) also have\ngovernance responsibilities, the professional accountant has satisfied the requirement to\ncommunicate with those charged with governance.\n\nSECTION 200 Page 31 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 210\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nIntroduction\n210.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n210.2\n\nA conflict of interest creates threats to compliance with the principle of objectivity and might create\nthreats to compliance with the other fundamental principles. Such threats might be created when:\n(a)\n\nA professional accountant undertakes a professional activity related to a particular matter\nfor two or more parties whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or\n\n(b)\n\nThe interest of a professional accountant with respect to a particular matter and the\ninterests of a party for whom the accountant undertakes a professional activity related to\nthat matter are in conflict.\n\nA party might include an employing organisation, a vendor, a customer, a lender, a shareholder,\nor another party.\n210.3\n\nThis section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the\nconceptual framework to conflicts of interest.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR210.4\n\nA professional accountant shall not allow a conflict of interest to compromise professional or\nbusiness judgement.\n\n210.4 A1\n\nExamples of circumstances that might create a conflict of interest include:\n•\n\nServing in a management or governance position for two employing organisations and\nacquiring confidential information from one organisation that might be used by the\nprofessional accountant to the advantage or disadvantage of the other organisation.\n\n•\n\nUndertaking a professional activity for each of two parties in a partnership, where both\nparties are employing the accountant to assist them to dissolve their partnership.\n\n•\n\nPreparing financial information for certain members of management of the accountant’s\nemploying organisation who are seeking to undertake a management buy-out.\n\n•\n\nBeing responsible for selecting a vendor for the employing organisation when an\nimmediate family member of the accountant might benefit financially from the transaction.\n\n•\n\nServing in a governance capacity in an employing organisation that is approving certain\ninvestments for the company where one of those investments will increase the value of the\ninvestment portfolio of the accountant or an immediate family member.\n\nConflict Identification\nR210.5\n\nR210.6\n\nA professional accountant shall take reasonable steps to identify circumstances that might create\na conflict of interest, and therefore a threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental\nprinciples.

This section guides the\naccountant in assessing the implications of the matter and the possible courses of action when\nresponding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with:\n(a)\n\nLaws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of\nmaterial amounts and disclosures in the employing organisation’s financial statements;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nOther laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the\namounts and disclosures in the employing organisation’s financial statements, but\ncompliance with which might be fundamental to the operating aspects of the employing\norganisation’s business, to its ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties.\n\nObjectives of the Professional Accountant in Relation to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations\n260.4\n\nA distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act\nin the public interest. When responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the\nobjectives of the professional accountant are:\n(a)\n\nTo comply with the principles of integrity and professional behaviour;\n\n(b)\n\nBy alerting management or, where appropriate, those charged with governance of the\nemploying organisation, to seek to:\n\n(c)\n\n(i)\n\nEnable them to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the identified or\nsuspected non-compliance; or\n\n(ii)\n\nDeter the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; and\n\nTo take such further action as appropriate in the public interest.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n260.5 A1\n\n260.5 A2\n\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations (“non-compliance”) comprises acts of omission or\ncommission, intentional or unintentional, which are contrary to the prevailing laws or regulations\ncommitted by the following parties:\n(a)\n\nThe professional accountant’s employing organisation;\n\n(b)\n\nThose charged with governance of the employing organisation;\n\n(c)\n\nManagement of the employing organisation; or\n\n(d)\n\nOther individuals working for or under the direction of the employing organisation.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations which this section addresses include those that deal with:\n•\n\nFraud, corruption and bribery.\n\n•\n\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and proceeds of crime.\n\n•\n\nSecurities markets and trading.\n\n•\n\nBanking and other financial products and services.\n\n•\n\nData protection.\n\n•\n\nTax and pension liabilities and payments.\nSECTION 260 Page 44 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nEnvironmental protection.\n\n•\n\nPublic health and safety.\n\n260.5 A3\n\nNon-compliance might result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the employing\norganisation, potentially materially affecting its financial statements. Importantly, such noncompliance might have wider public interest implications in terms of potentially substantial harm\nto investors, creditors, employees or the general public. For the purposes of this section, noncompliance that causes substantial harm is one that results in serious adverse consequences to\nany of these parties in financial or non-financial terms. Examples include the perpetration of a\nfraud resulting in significant financial losses to investors, and breaches of environmental laws\nand regulations endangering the health or safety of employees or the public.\n\nR260.6\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are legal or regulatory provisions governing how professional\naccountants are required to address non-compliance or suspected non-compliance. These legal\nor regulatory provisions might differ from or go beyond the provisions in this section. When\nencountering such non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall obtain\nan understanding of those legal or regulatory provisions and comply with them, including:\n(a)\n\nAny requirement to report the matter to an appropriate authority; and\n\n(b)\n\nAny prohibition on alerting the relevant party.\n\n260.6 A1\n\nA prohibition on alerting the relevant party might arise, for example, pursuant to anti-money\nlaundering legislation.\n\n260.7 A1\n\nThis section applies regardless of the nature of the employing organisation, including whether or\nnot it is a public interest entity.\n\n260.7 A2\n\nA professional accountant who encounters or is made aware of matters that are clearly\ninconsequential is not required to comply with this section. Whether a matter is clearly\ninconsequential is to be judged with respect to its nature and its impact, financial or otherwise,\non the employing organisation, its stakeholders and the general public.\n\n260.7 A3\n\nThis section does not address:\n(a)\n\nPersonal misconduct unrelated to the business activities of the employing organisation;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nNon-compliance by parties other than those specified in paragraph 260.5 A1.\n\nThe professional accountant might nevertheless find the guidance in this section helpful in\nconsidering how to respond in these situations.\nResponsibilities of the Employing Organisation’s Management and Those Charged with Governance\n260.8 A1\n\nThe employing organisation’s management, with the oversight of those charged with\ngovernance, is responsible for ensuring that the employing organisation’s business activities are\nconducted in accordance with laws and regulations. Management and those charged with\ngovernance are also responsible for identifying and addressing any non-compliance by:\n(a)\n\nThe employing organisation;\n\n(b)\n\nAn individual charged with governance of the employing organisation;\n\n(c)\n\nA member of management; or\n\n(d)\n\nOther individuals working for or under the direction of the employing organisation.\n\nResponsibilities of All Professional Accountants\nR260.9\n\nIf protocols and procedures exist within the professional accountant’s employing organisation to\naddress non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall consider them in\ndetermining how to respond to such non-compliance.\n\n260.9 A1\n\nMany employing organisations have established protocols and procedures regarding how to\nraise non-compliance or suspected non-compliance internally. These protocols and procedures\ninclude, for example, an ethics policy or internal whistle-blowing mechanism. Such protocols and\nprocedures might allow matters to be reported anonymously through designated channels.\n\nR260.10\n\nWhere a professional accountant becomes aware of a matter to which this section applies, the\nsteps that the accountant takes to comply with this section shall be taken on a timely basis. For\nSECTION 260 Page 45 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nthe purpose of taking timely steps, the accountant shall have regard to the nature of the matter\nand the potential harm to the interests of the employing organisation, investors, creditors,\nemployees or the general public.\nResponsibilities of Senior Professional Accountants in Business\n260.11 A1\n\nSenior professional accountants in business (“senior professional accountants”) are directors,\nofficers or senior employees able to exert significant influence over, and make decisions\nregarding, the acquisition, deployment and control of the employing organisation’s human,\nfinancial, technological, physical and intangible resources. There is a greater expectation for\nsuch individuals to take whatever action is appropriate in the public interest to respond to noncompliance or suspected non-compliance than other professional accountants within the\nemploying organisation. This is because of senior professional accountants’ roles, positions and\nspheres of influence within the employing organisation.\n\nObtaining an Understanding of the Matter\nR260.12\n\nIf, in the course of carrying out professional activities, a senior professional accountant becomes\naware of information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant\nshall obtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include:\n(a)\n\nThe nature of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in\nwhich it has occurred or might occur;\n\n(b)\n\nThe application of the relevant laws and regulations to the circumstances; and\n\n(c)\n\nAn assessment of the potential consequences to the employing organisation, investors,\ncreditors, employees or the wider public.\n\n260.12 A1\n\nA senior professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise\nprofessional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of\nunderstanding of laws and regulations greater than that which is required for the accountant’s\nrole within the employing organisation. Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately\na matter to be determined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.\n\n260.12 A2\n\nDepending on the nature and significance of the matter, the senior professional accountant might\ncause, or take appropriate steps to cause, the matter to be investigated internally. The\naccountant might also consult on a confidential basis with others within the employing\norganisation or a professional body, or with legal counsel.\n\nAddressing the Matter\nR260.13\n\nIf the senior professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or\nmight occur, the accountant shall, subject to paragraph R260.9, discuss the matter with the\naccountant’s immediate superior, if any. If the accountant’s immediate superior appears to be\ninvolved in the matter, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the next higher level of\nauthority within the employing organisation.\n\n260.13 A1\n\nThe purpose of the discussion is to enable a determination to be made as to how to address the\nmatter.\n\nR260.14\n\nThe senior professional accountant shall also take appropriate steps to:\n\n260.14 A1\n\n(a)\n\nHave the matter communicated to those charged with governance;\n\n(b)\n\nComply with applicable laws and regulations, including legal or regulatory provisions\ngoverning the reporting of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate\nauthority;\n\n(c)\n\nHave the consequences of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance rectified,\nremediated or mitigated;\n\n(d)\n\nReduce the risk of re-occurrence; and\n\n(e)\n\nSeek to deter the commission of the non-compliance if it has not yet occurred.\n\nThe purpose of communicating the matter to those charged with governance is to obtain their\nconcurrence regarding appropriate actions to take to respond to the matter and to enable them\nto fulfil their responsibilities.\n\nSECTION 260 Page 46 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n260.14 A2\n\nSome laws and regulations might stipulate a period within which reports of non-compliance or\nsuspected non-compliance are to be made to an appropriate authority.\n\nR260.15\n\nIn addition to responding to the matter in accordance with the provisions of this section, the senior\nprofessional accountant shall determine whether disclosure of the matter to the employing\norganisation’s external auditor, if any, is needed.\n\n260.15 A1\n\nSuch disclosure would be pursuant to the senior professional accountant’s duty or legal\nobligation to provide all information necessary to enable the auditor to perform the audit.\n\nDetermining Whether Further Action Is Needed\nR260.16\n\nThe senior professional accountant shall assess the appropriateness of the response of the\naccountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance.\n\n260.16 A1\n\nRelevant factors to consider in assessing the appropriateness of the response of the senior\nprofessional accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance include whether:\n•\n\nThe response is timely.\n\n•\n\nThey have taken or authorised appropriate action to seek to rectify, remediate or mitigate\nthe consequences of the non-compliance, or to avert the non-compliance if it has not yet\noccurred.\n\n•\n\nThe matter has been disclosed to an appropriate authority where appropriate and, if so,\nwhether the disclosure appears adequate.\n\nR260.17\n\nIn light of the response of the senior professional accountant’s superiors, if any, and those\ncharged with governance, the accountant shall determine if further action is needed in the public\ninterest.\n\n260.17 A1\n\nThe determination of whether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend\non various factors, including:\n\n260.17 A2\n\n•\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework.\n\n•\n\nThe urgency of the situation.\n\n•\n\nThe pervasiveness of the matter throughout the employing organisation.\n\n•\n\nWhether the senior professional accountant continues to have confidence in the integrity\nof the accountant’s superiors and those charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nWhether the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance is likely to recur.\n\n•\n\nWhether there is credible evidence of actual or potential substantial harm to the interests\nof the employing organisation, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.\n\nExamples of circumstances that might cause the senior professional accountant no longer to\nhave confidence in the integrity of the accountant’s superiors and those charged with governance\ninclude situations where:\n•\n\nThe accountant suspects or has evidence of their involvement or intended involvement in\nany non-compliance.\n\n•\n\nContrary to legal or regulatory requirements, they have not reported, or authorised the\nreporting of, the matter to an appropriate authority within a reasonable period.\n\nR260.18\n\nThe senior professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement in determining the\nneed for, and nature and extent of, further action. In making this determination, the accountant\nshall take into account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude\nthat the accountant has acted appropriately in the public interest.\n\n260.18 A1\n\nFurther action that the senior professional accountant might take includes:\n•\n\nInforming the management of the parent entity of the matter if the employing organisation\nis a member of a group.\n\n•\n\nDisclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory\nrequirement to do so.\n\n•\n\nResigning from the employing organisation.\n\nSECTION 260 Page 47 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n260.18 A2\n\nResigning from the employing organisation is not a substitute for taking other actions that might\nbe needed to achieve the senior professional accountant’s objectives under this section. In some\njurisdictions, however, there might be limitations as to the further actions available to the\naccountant. In such circumstances, resignation might be the only available course of action.\n\nSeeking Advice\n260.19 A1\n\nAs assessment of the matter might involve complex analysis and judgements, the senior\nprofessional accountant might consider:\n•\n\nConsulting internally.\n\n•\n\nObtaining legal advice to understand the accountant’s options and the professional or legal\nimplications of taking any particular course of action.\n\n•\n\nConsulting on a confidential basis with a regulatory or professional body.\n\nDetermining Whether to Disclose the Matter to an Appropriate Authority\n260.20 A1\n\nDisclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority would be precluded if doing so would be\ncontrary to law or regulation. Otherwise, the purpose of making disclosure is to enable an\nappropriate authority to cause the matter to be investigated and action to be taken in the public\ninterest.\n\n260.20 A2\n\nThe determination of whether to make such a disclosure depends in particular on the nature and\nextent of the actual or potential harm that is or might be caused by the matter to investors,\ncreditors, employees or the general public. For example, the senior professional accountant\nmight determine that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course\nof action if:\n\n260.20 A3\n\nR260.21\n\n•\n\nThe employing organisation is engaged in bribery (for example, of local or foreign\ngovernment officials for purposes of securing large contracts).\n\n•\n\nThe employing organisation is regulated and the matter is of such significance as to\nthreaten its license to operate.\n\n•\n\nThe employing organisation is listed on a securities exchange and the matter might result\nin adverse consequences to the fair and orderly market in the employing organisation’s\nsecurities or pose a systemic risk to the financial markets.\n\n•\n\nIt is likely that the employing organisation would sell products that are harmful to public\nhealth or safety.\n\n•\n\nThe employing organisation is promoting a scheme to its clients to assist them in evading\ntaxes.\n\nThe determination of whether to make such a disclosure will also depend on external factors\nsuch as:\n•\n\nWhether there is an appropriate authority that is able to receive the information, and cause\nthe matter to be investigated and action to be taken. The appropriate authority will depend\nupon the nature of the matter. For example, the appropriate authority would be a securities\nregulator in the case of fraudulent financial reporting or an environmental protection\nagency in the case of a breach of environmental laws and regulations.\n\n•\n\nWhether there exists robust and credible protection from civil, criminal or professional\nliability or retaliation afforded by legislation or regulation, such as under whistle-blowing\nlegislation or regulation.\n\n•\n\nWhether there are actual or potential threats to the physical safety of the senior\nprofessional accountant or other individuals.\n\nIf the senior professional accountant determines that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate\nauthority is an appropriate course of action in the circumstances, that disclosure is permitted\npursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When making such disclosure, the accountant shall\nact in good faith and exercise caution when making statements and assertions.\n\nImminent Breach\nR260.22\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the senior professional accountant might become aware of actual\nor intended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent\nSECTION 260 Page 48 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nbreach of a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors,\nemployees or the general public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to\ndiscuss the matter with management or those charged with governance of the employing\norganisation, the accountant shall exercise professional judgement and determine whether to\ndisclose the matter immediately to an appropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the\nconsequences of such imminent breach. If disclosure is made, that disclosure is permitted\npursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code.\nDocumentation\n260.23 A1\n\nIn relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this\nsection, the senior professional accountant is encouraged to have the following matters\ndocumented:\n•\n\nThe matter.\n\n•\n\nThe results of discussions with the accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with\ngovernance and other parties.\n\n•\n\nHow the accountant’s superiors, if any, and those charged with governance have\nresponded to the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe courses of action the accountant considered, the judgements made and the decisions\nthat were taken.\n\n•\n\nHow the accountant is satisfied that the accountant has fulfilled the responsibility set out\nin paragraph R260.17.\n\nResponsibilities of Professional Accountants Other than Senior Professional Accountants\nR260.24\n\nIf, in the course of carrying out professional activities, a professional accountant becomes aware\nof information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall\nseek to obtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include the nature of the\nnon-compliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in which it has occurred or\nmight occur.\n\n260.24 A1\n\nThe professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise\nprofessional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of understanding\nof laws and regulations greater than that which is required for the accountant’s role within the\nemploying organisation. Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be\ndetermined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.\n\n260.24 A2\n\nDepending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might\nconsult on a confidential basis with others within the employing organisation or a professional\nbody, or with legal counsel.\n\nR260.25\n\nIf the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might\noccur, the accountant shall, subject to paragraph R260.9, inform an immediate superior to enable\nthe superior to take appropriate action. If the accountant’s immediate superior appears to be\ninvolved in the matter, the accountant shall inform the next higher level of authority within the\nemploying organisation.\n\nR260.26\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant may determine that disclosure of the\nmatter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action. If the accountant does so\npursuant to paragraphs 260.20 A2 and A3, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph\nR114.3 of the Code.

Pressure might be explicit or implicit and might come from:\n•\n\nWithin the employing organisation, for example, from a colleague or superior.\n\n•\n\nAn external individual or organisation such as a vendor, customer or lender.\n\n•\n\nInternal or external targets and expectations.\n\nExamples of pressure that might result in threats to compliance with the fundamental principles\ninclude:\n•\n\nPressure related to conflicts of interest:\no\n\nPressure from a family member bidding to act as a vendor to the professional\naccountant’s employing organisation to select the family member over another\nprospective vendor.\n\nSee also Section 210, Conflicts of Interest.\n•\n\nPressure to influence preparation or presentation of information:\no\n\nPressure to report misleading financial results to meet investor, analyst or lender\nexpectations.\n\no\n\nPressure from elected officials on public sector accountants to misrepresent\nprogrammes or projects to voters.\n\no\n\nPressure from colleagues to misstate income, expenditure or rates of return to bias\ndecision-making on capital projects and acquisitions.\n\no\n\nPressure from superiors to approve or process expenditures that are not legitimate\nbusiness expenses.\n\no\n\nPressure to suppress internal audit reports containing adverse findings.\n\nSee also Section 220, Preparation and Presentation of Information.\n•\n\nPressure to act without sufficient expertise or due care:\no\n\nPressure from superiors to inappropriately reduce the extent of work performed.\n\no\n\nPressure from superiors to perform a task without sufficient skills or training or within\nunrealistic deadlines.\n\nSee also Section 230, Acting with Sufficient Expertise.\n\nSECTION 270 Page 51 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nPressure related to financial interests:\no\n\nPressure from superiors, colleagues or others, for example, those who might benefit\nfrom participation in compensation or incentive arrangements to manipulate\nperformance indicators.\n\nSee also Section 240, Financial Interests, Compensation and Incentives Linked to\nFinancial Reporting and Decision Making.\n•\n\nPressure related to inducements:\no\n\nPressure from others, either internal or external to the employing organisation, to\noffer inducements to influence inappropriately the judgement or decision making\nprocess of an individual or organisation.\n\no\n\nPressure from colleagues to accept a bribe or other inducement, for example to\naccept inappropriate gifts or entertainment from potential vendors in a bidding\nprocess.\n\nSee also Section 250, Inducements, Including Gifts and Hospitality.\n•\n\nPressure related to non-compliance with laws and regulations:\no\n\nPressure to structure a transaction to evade tax.\n\nSee also Section 260, Responding to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations.\n•\n\nPressure related to level of fees:\no\n\nPressure exerted by a professional accountant on another professional accountant\nto provide professional services at a fee level that does not allow for sufficient and\nappropriate resources (including human, technological and intellectual resources) to\nperform the services in accordance with technical and professional standards.\n\nSee also Section 330, Fees and Other Types of Remuneration\n270.3 A3\n\n270.3 A4\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created by pressure include:\n•\n\nThe intent of the individual who is exerting the pressure and the nature and extent of the\npressure.\n\n•\n\nThe application of laws, regulations, and professional standards to the circumstances.\n\n•\n\nThe culture and leadership of the employing organisation including the extent to which they\nreflect or emphasise the importance of ethical behaviour and the expectation that\nemployees will act ethically. For example, a corporate culture that tolerates unethical\nbehaviour might increase the likelihood that the pressure would result in a threat to\ncompliance with the fundamental principles.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures, if any, that the employing organisation has established, such as\nethics or human resources policies that address pressure.\n\nDiscussing the circumstances creating the pressure and consulting with others about those\ncircumstances might assist the professional accountant to evaluate the level of the threat. Such\ndiscussion and consultation, which requires being alert to the principle of confidentiality, might\ninclude:\n•\n\nDiscussing the matter with the individual who is exerting the pressure to seek to resolve it.\n\n•\n\nDiscussing the matter with the accountant’s superior, if the superior is not the individual\nexerting the pressure.\n\n•\n\nEscalating the matter within the employing organisation, including when appropriate,\nexplaining any consequential risks to the organisation, for example with:\no\n\nHigher levels of management.\n\no\n\nInternal or external auditors.\n\no\n\nThose charged with governance.\n\nSECTION 270 Page 52 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n270.3 A5\n\n•\n\nDisclosing the matter in line with the employing organisation’s policies, including ethics\nand whistleblowing policies, using any established mechanism, such as a confidential\nethics hotline.\n\n•\n\nConsulting with:\no\n\nA colleague, superior, human resources personnel, or another professional\naccountant;\n\no\n\nRelevant professional or regulatory bodies or industry associations; or\n\no\n\nLegal counsel.\n\nAn example of an action that might eliminate threats created by pressure is the professional\naccountant’s request for a restructure of, or segregation of, certain responsibilities and duties so\nthat the accountant is no longer involved with the individual or entity exerting the pressure.\n\nDocumentation\n270.4 A1\n\nThe professional accountant is encouraged to document:\n•\n\nThe facts.\n\n•\n\nThe communications and parties with whom these matters were discussed.\n\n•\n\nThe courses of action considered.\n\n•\n\nHow the matter was addressed.\n\nSECTION 270 Page 53 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPage\nSection 300\n\nApplying the Conceptual Framework – Professional\nAccountants in Public Practice .....................................................................................................55\n\nSection 310\n\nConflicts of Interest ....................................................................................................................61\n\nSection 320\n\nProfessional Appointments ........................................................................................................65\n\nSection 321\n\nSecond Opinions ........................................................................................................................70\n\nSection 325\n\nObjectivity of an Engagement Quality Reviewer and Other\nAppropriate Reviewers .................................................................................................................71\n\nSection 330\n\nFees and Other Types of Remuneration ...................................................................................73\n\nSection 331\n\nAgencies and Referral ...............................................................................................................79\n\nSection 340\n\nInducements, Including Gifts and Hospitality .............................................................................84\n\nSection 350\n\nCustody of Client Assets ............................................................................................................88\n\nSection 360\n\nResponding to Non-compliance with Laws and Regulations .....................................................89\n\nPART 3 – TABLE OF CONTENTS Page 54 of 226\n\nPART 3\n\nPART 3 – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN PUBLIC\nPRACTICE\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPART 3 - PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN PUBLIC PRACTICE\nSECTION 300\nAPPLYING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN\nPUBLIC PRACTICE\nIntroduction\n300.1\n\nThis Part of the Code sets out requirements and application material for professional accountants\nin public practice when applying the conceptual framework set out in Section 120. It does not\ndescribe all of the facts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and\nrelationships, that could be encountered by professional accountants in public practice, which\ncreate or might create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. Therefore, the\nconceptual framework requires professional accountants in public practice to be alert for such\nfacts and circumstances.\n\n300.2\n\nThe requirements and application material that apply to professional accountants in public\npractice are set out in:\n\n300.3\n\n300.3 (a)\n\n•\n\nPart 3 – Professional Accountants in Public Practice, Sections 300 to 399, which applies\nto all professional accountants in public practice, whether they provide assurance services\nor not.\n\n•\n\nInternational Independence Standards as follows:\no\n\nPart 4A – Independence for Audit and Review Engagements, Sections 400 to 899,\nwhich applies to professional accountants in public practice when performing audit\nand review engagements.\n\no\n\nPart 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review\nEngagements, Sections 900 to 999, which applies to professional accountants in\npublic practice when performing assurance engagements other than audit or review\nengagements.\n\nIn this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in\npublic practice and their firms.\nIn this Part, the term “professional accountant” also applies to professional accountants in\nbusiness when providing professional services.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR300.4\n\nA professional accountant shall comply with the fundamental principles set out in Section 110\nand apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address\nthreats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\nR300.5\n\nWhen dealing with an ethics issue, the professional accountant shall consider the context in\nwhich the issue has arisen or might arise. Where an individual who is a professional accountant\nin public practice is performing professional activities pursuant to the accountant’s relationship\nwith the firm, whether as a contractor, employee or owner, the individual shall comply with the\nprovisions in Part 2 that apply to these circumstances.\n\n300.5 A1\n\nExamples of situations in which the provisions in Part 2 apply to a professional accountant in\npublic practice include:\n•\n\nFacing a conflict of interest when being responsible for selecting a vendor for the firm when\nan immediate family member of the accountant might benefit financially from the contract.\nThe requirements and application material set out in Section 210 apply in these\ncircumstances.\n\n•\n\nPreparing or presenting financial information for the accountant’s client or firm. The\nrequirements and application material set out in Section 220 apply in these circumstances.\n\nSECTION 300 Page 55 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n300.5 A2\n\n•\n\nBeing offered an inducement such as being regularly offered complimentary tickets to\nattend sporting events by a supplier of the firm. The requirements and application material\nset out in Section 250 apply in these circumstances.\n\n•\n\nFacing pressure from an engagement partner to report chargeable hours inaccurately for a\nclient engagement. The requirements and application material set out in Section 270 apply\nin these circumstances.\n\nThe more senior the position of a professional accountant, the greater will be the ability and\nopportunity to access information, and to influence policies, decisions made and actions taken\nby others involved with the firm. To the extent that they are able to do so, taking into account their\nposition and seniority in the firm, accountants are expected to encourage and promote an ethicsbased culture in the firm and exhibit ethical behaviour in dealings with individuals with whom, and\nentities with which, the accountant or the firm has a professional or business relationship in\naccordance with paragraph 120.13 A3. Examples of actions that might be taken include the\nintroduction, implementation and oversight of:\n•\n\nEthics education and training programmes.\n\n•\n\nFirm processes and performance evaluation and reward criteria that promote an ethical\nculture.\n\n•\n\nEthics and whistle-blowing policies.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures designed to prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nIdentifying Threats\n300.6 A1\n\nThreats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created by a broad range of facts\nand circumstances. The categories of threats are described in paragraph 120.6 A3. The following\nare examples of facts and circumstances within each of those categories of threats that might\ncreate threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional service:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nSelf-interest Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant having a direct financial interest in a client.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant quoting a low fee to obtain a new engagement and the\nfee is so low that it might be difficult to perform the professional service in accordance\nwith applicable technical and professional standards for that price.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having a close business relationship with a client.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having access to confidential information that might be\nused for personal gain.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant discovering a significant error when evaluating the results\nof a previous professional service performed by a member of the accountant’s firm.\n\nSelf-review Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant issuing an assurance report on the effectiveness of the\noperation of financial systems after implementing the systems.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having prepared the original data used to generate\nrecords that are the subject matter of the assurance engagement.\n\nAdvocacy Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant promoting the interests of, or shares in, a client.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant acting as an advocate on behalf of a client in litigation or\ndisputes with third parties.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant lobbying in favour of legislation on behalf of a client.\n\nFamiliarity Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant having a close or immediate family member who is a\ndirector or officer of the client.\n\nSECTION 300 Page 56 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(e)\n\n•\n\nA director or officer of the client, or an employee in a position to exert significant\ninfluence over the subject matter of the engagement, having recently served as the\nengagement partner.\n\n•\n\nAn audit team member having a long association with the audit client.\n\n•\n\nAn individual who is being considered to serve as an appropriate reviewer, as a\nsafeguard to address a threat, having a close relationship with an individual who\nperformed the work.\n\nIntimidation Threats\n•\n\nA professional accountant being threatened with dismissal from a client engagement\nor the firm because of a disagreement about a professional matter.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant feeling pressured to agree with the judgement of a client\nbecause the client has more expertise on the matter in question.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant being informed that a planned promotion will not occur\nunless the accountant agrees with an inappropriate accounting treatment.\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant having accepted a significant gift from a client and being\nthreatened that acceptance of this gift will be made public.\n\nIdentifying Threats Associated with the Use of Technology\n300.6 A2\n\nThe following are examples of facts and circumstances relating to the use of technology that\nmight create threats for a professional accountant when undertaking a professional activity:\n•\n\nSelf-interest Threats\no\nThe data available might not be sufficient for the effective use of the technology.\no\nThe technology might not be appropriate for the purpose for which it is to be used.\no\nThe accountant might not have sufficient information and expertise, or access to\nan expert with sufficient understanding, to use and explain the technology and its\nappropriateness for the purpose intended.\n(Ref: Para. 230.2).\n\n•\n\nSelf-review Threats\no\nThe technology was designed or developed using the knowledge, expertise or\njudgement of the accountant or the firm.\n\nEvaluating Threats\n300.7 A1\n\n300.7 A2\n\nThe conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.6 A1 and 120.8 A2 might\nimpact the evaluation of whether a threat to compliance with the fundamental principles is at an\nacceptable level. Such conditions, policies and procedures might relate to:\n(a)\n\nThe client and its operating environment; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe firm and its operating environment.\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat is also impacted by the nature\nand scope of the professional service.\n\nThe Client and its Operating Environment\n300.7 A3\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by whether\nthe client is:\n(a)\n\nAn audit client and whether the audit client is a public interest entity;\n\n(b)\n\nAn assurance client that is not an audit client; or\n\n(c)\n\nA non-assurance client.\n\nFor example, providing a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity\nmight be perceived to result in a higher level of threat to compliance with the principle of objectivity\nwith respect to the audit.\n\nSECTION 300 Page 57 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n300.7 A4\n\nThe corporate governance structure, including the leadership of a client might promote\ncompliance with the fundamental principles. Accordingly, a professional accountant’s evaluation\nof the level of a threat might also be impacted by a client’s operating environment. For example:\n•\n\nThe client requires appropriate individuals other than management to ratify or approve the\nappointment of a firm to perform an engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe client has competent employees with experience and seniority to make managerial\ndecisions.\n\n•\n\nThe client has implemented internal procedures that facilitate objective choices in\ntendering non-assurance engagements.\n\n•\n\nThe client has a corporate governance structure that provides appropriate oversight and\ncommunications regarding the firm’s services.\n\nThe Firm and its Operating Environment\n300.7 A5\n\n300.7 A6\n\nA professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat might be impacted by the work\nenvironment within the accountant’s firm and its operating environment. For example:\n•\n\nLeadership of the firm that promotes compliance with the fundamental principles and\nestablishes the expectation that assurance team members will act in the public interest.\n\n•\n\nPolicies or procedures for establishing and monitoring compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples by all personnel.\n\n•\n\nCompensation, performance appraisal and disciplinary policies and procedures that\npromote compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\n•\n\nManagement of the reliance on revenue received from a single client.\n\n•\n\nThe engagement partner having authority within the firm for decisions concerning\ncompliance with the fundamental principles, including any decisions about accepting or\nproviding services to a client.\n\n•\n\nEducational, training and experience requirements.\n\n•\n\nProcesses to facilitate and address internal and external concerns or complaints.\n\nThe professional accountant’s evaluation of the level of a threat associated with the use of\ntechnology might also be impacted by the work environment within the accountant’s firm and its\noperating environment. For example:\n•\n\nLevel of corporate oversight and internal controls over the technology.\n\n•\n\nAssessments of the quality and functionality of technology that are undertaken by a thirdparty.\n\n•\n\nTraining that is provided regularly to all relevant employees so they obtain and maintain\nthe professional competence to sufficiently understand, use and explain the technology\nand its appropriateness for the purpose intended.\n\nConsideration of New Information or Changes in Facts and Circumstances\n300.7 A7\n\nNew information or changes in facts and circumstances might:\n(a)\n\nImpact the level of a threat; or\n\n(b)\n\nAffect the professional accountant’s conclusions about whether safeguards applied\ncontinue to address identified threats as intended.\n\nIn these situations, actions that were already implemented as safeguards might no longer be\neffective in addressing threats. Accordingly, the application of the conceptual framework requires\nthat the professional accountant re-evaluate and address the threats accordingly. (Ref: Paras.\nR120.9 and R120.10).\n300.7 A8\n\nExamples of new information or changes in facts and circumstances that might impact the level\nof a threat include:\n•\n\nWhen the scope of a professional service is expanded.\n\n•\n\nWhen the client becomes a publicly traded entity or acquires another business unit.\nSECTION 300 Page 58 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nWhen the firm merges with another firm.\n\n•\n\nWhen the professional accountant is jointly engaged by two clients and a dispute emerges\nbetween the two clients.\n\n•\n\nWhen there is a change in the professional accountant’s personal or immediate family\nrelationships.\n\nAddressing Threats\n300.8 A1\n\nParagraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 set out requirements and application material for addressing\nthreats that are not at an acceptable level.\n\nExamples of Safeguards\n300.8 A2\n\n300.8 A3\n\nSafeguards vary depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of actions that in certain\ncircumstances might be safeguards to address threats include:\n•\n\nAssigning additional time and qualified personnel to required tasks when an engagement\nhas been accepted might address a self-interest threat.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not a member of the team review the work\nperformed or advise as necessary might address a self-review threat.\n\n•\n\nUsing different partners and teams with separate reporting lines for the provision of nonassurance services to an assurance client might address self-review, advocacy or\nfamiliarity threats.\n\n•\n\nInvolving another firm to perform or re-perform part of the engagement might address selfinterest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity or intimidation threats.\n\n•\n\nDisclosing to clients any referral fees or commission arrangements received for\nrecommending services or products might address a self-interest threat.\n\n•\n\nSeparating teams when dealing with matters of a confidential nature might address a selfinterest threat.\n\nThe remaining sections of Part 3 and International Independence Standards describe certain\nthreats that might arise during the course of performing professional services and include\nexamples of actions that might address threats.\n\nAppropriate Reviewer\n300.8 A4\n\nAn appropriate reviewer is a professional with the necessary knowledge, skills, experience and\nauthority to review, in an objective manner, the relevant work performed or service provided.\nSuch an individual might be a professional accountant.\n\nCommunicating with Those Charged with Governance\nR300.9\n\nWhen communicating with those charged with governance in accordance with the Code, a\nprofessional accountant shall determine the appropriate individual(s) within the entity’s\ngovernance structure with whom to communicate. If the accountant communicates with a\nsubgroup of those charged with governance, the accountant shall determine whether\ncommunication with all of those charged with governance is also necessary so that they are\nadequately informed.\n\n300.9 A1\n\nIn determining with whom to communicate, a professional accountant might consider:\n(a)\n\nThe nature and importance of the circumstances; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe matter to be communicated.\n\n300.9 A2\n\nExamples of a subgroup of those charged with governance include an audit committee or an\nindividual member of those charged with governance.\n\nR300.10\n\nIf a professional accountant communicates with individuals who have management\nresponsibilities as well as governance responsibilities, the accountant shall be satisfied that\ncommunication with those individuals adequately informs all of those in a governance role with\nwhom the accountant would otherwise communicate.\n\n300.10 A1\n\nIn some circumstances, all of those charged with governance are involved in managing the entity,\nfor example, a small business where a single owner manages the entity and no one else has a\nSECTION 300 Page 59 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\ngovernance role. In these cases, if matters are communicated to individual(s) with management\nresponsibilities, and those individual(s) also have governance responsibilities, the professional\naccountant has satisfied the requirement to communicate with those charged with governance.\n\nSECTION 300 Page 60 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 310\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nIntroduction\n310.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n310.2\n\nA conflict of interest creates threats to compliance with the principle of objectivity and might create\nthreats to compliance with the other fundamental principles. Such threats might be created when:\n\n310.3\n\n(a)\n\nA professional accountant provides a professional service related to a particular matter for\ntwo or more clients whose interests with respect to that matter are in conflict; or\n\n(b)\n\nThe interests of a professional accountant with respect to a particular matter and the\ninterests of the client for whom the accountant provides a professional service related to\nthat matter are in conflict.\n\nThis section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the\nconceptual framework to conflicts of interest. When a professional accountant provides an audit,\nreview or other assurance service, independence is also required in accordance with\nInternational Independence Standards.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR310.4\n\nA professional accountant shall not allow a conflict of interest to compromise professional or\nbusiness judgement.\n\n310.4 A1\n\nExamples of circumstances that might create a conflict of interest include:\n•\n\nProviding a transaction advisory service to a client seeking to acquire an audit client, where\nthe firm has obtained confidential information during the course of the audit that might be\nrelevant to the transaction.\n\n•\n\nProviding advice to two clients at the same time where the clients are competing to acquire\nthe same company and the advice might be relevant to the parties’ competitive positions.\n\n•\n\nProviding services to a seller and a buyer in relation to the same transaction.\n\n•\n\nPreparing valuations of assets for two parties who are in an adversarial position with\nrespect to the assets.\n\n•\n\nRepresenting two clients in the same matter who are in a legal dispute with each other,\nsuch as during divorce proceedings, or the dissolution of a partnership.\n\n•\n\nIn relation to a license agreement, providing an assurance report for a licensor on the\nroyalties due while advising the licensee on the amounts payable.\n\n•\n\nAdvising a client to invest in a business in which, for example, the spouse of the\nprofessional accountant has a financial interest.\n\n•\n\nProviding strategic advice to a client on its competitive position while having a joint venture\nor similar interest with a major competitor of the client.\n\n•\n\nAdvising a client on acquiring a business which the firm is also interested in acquiring.\n\n•\n\nAdvising a client on buying a product or service while having a royalty or commission\nagreement with a potential seller of that product or service.\n\nConflict Identification\nGeneral\nR310.5\n\nBefore accepting a new client relationship, engagement, or business relationship, a professional\naccountant shall take reasonable steps to identify circumstances that might create a conflict of\ninterest, and therefore a threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles.\nSuch steps shall include identifying:\n(a)\n\nThe nature of the relevant interests and relationships between the parties involved; and\nSECTION 310 Page 61 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(b)\n\nThe service and its implication for relevant parties.\n\n310.5 A1\n\nAn effective conflict identification process assists a professional accountant when taking\nreasonable steps to identify interests and relationships that might create an actual or potential\nconflict of interest, both before determining whether to accept an engagement and throughout\nthe engagement. Such a process includes considering matters identified by external parties, for\nexample clients or potential clients. The earlier an actual or potential conflict of interest is\nidentified, the greater the likelihood of the accountant being able to address threats created by\nthe conflict of interest.\n\n310.5 A2\n\nAn effective process to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest will take into account factors\nsuch as:\n\n310.5 A3\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the professional services provided.\n\n•\n\nThe size of the firm.\n\n•\n\nThe size and nature of the client base.\n\n•\n\nThe structure of the firm, for example, the number and geographic location of offices.\n\nMore information on client acceptance is set out in Section 320, Professional Appointments.\n\nChanges in Circumstances\nR310.6\n\nA professional accountant shall remain alert to changes over time in the nature of services,\ninterests and relationships that might create a conflict of interest while performing an\nengagement.\n\n310.6 A1\n\nThe nature of services, interests and relationships might change during the engagement. This is\nparticularly true when a professional accountant is asked to conduct an engagement in a situation\nthat might become adversarial, even though the parties who engage the accountant initially might\nnot be involved in a dispute.\n\nNetwork Firms\nR310.7\n\nIf the firm is a member of a network, a professional accountant shall consider conflicts of interest\nthat the accountant has reason to believe might exist or arise due to interests and relationships\nof a network firm.\n\n310.7 A1\n\nFactors to consider when identifying interests and relationships involving a network firm include:\n•\n\nThe nature of the professional services provided.\n\n•\n\nThe clients served by the network.\n\n•\n\nThe geographic locations of all relevant parties.\n\nThreats Created by Conflicts of Interest\n310.8 A1\n\nIn general, the more direct the connection between the professional service and the matter on\nwhich the parties’ interests conflict, the more likely the level of the threat is not at an acceptable\nlevel.\n\n310.8 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a threat created by a conflict of interest include\nmeasures that prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential information when performing\nprofessional services related to a particular matter for two or more clients whose interests with\nrespect to that matter are in conflict. These measures include:\n\n310.8 A3\n\n•\n\nThe existence of separate practice areas for specialty functions within the firm, which might\nact as a barrier to the passing of confidential client information between practice areas.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures to limit access to client files.\n\n•\n\nConfidentiality agreements signed by personnel and partners of the firm.\n\n•\n\nSeparation of confidential information physically and electronically.\n\n•\n\nSpecific and dedicated training and communication.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address threats created by a conflict of interest\ninclude:\n•\n\nHaving separate teams who are provided with clear policies and procedures on\nSECTION 310 Page 62 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nmaintaining confidentiality.\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer, who is not involved in providing the service or otherwise\naffected by the conflict, review the work performed to assess whether the key judgements\nand conclusions are appropriate.\n\nDisclosure and Consent\nGeneral\nR310.9\n\nA professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement to determine whether the nature\nand significance of a conflict of interest are such that specific disclosure and explicit consent are\nnecessary when addressing the threat created by the conflict of interest.\n\n310.9 A1\n\nFactors to consider when determining whether specific disclosure and explicit consent are\nnecessary include:\n\n310.9 A2\n\n310.9 A3\n\n310.9 A4\n\n•\n\nThe circumstances creating the conflict of interest.\n\n•\n\nThe parties that might be affected.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the issues that might arise.\n\n•\n\nThe potential for the particular matter to develop in an unexpected manner.\n\nDisclosure and consent might take different forms, for example:\n•\n\nGeneral disclosure to clients of circumstances where, as is common commercial practice,\nthe professional accountant does not provide professional services exclusively to any one\nclient (for example, in a particular professional service and market sector).

This section sets out specific\nrequirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such\ncircumstances.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nClient and Engagement Acceptance\nGeneral\n320.3 A1\n\nThreats to compliance with the principles of integrity or professional behaviour might be created,\nfor example, from questionable issues associated with the client (its owners, management or\nactivities). Issues that, if known, might create such a threat include client involvement in illegal\nactivities, dishonesty, questionable financial reporting practices or other unethical behaviour.\n\n320.3 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:\n•\n\nKnowledge and understanding of the client, its owners, management and those charged with\ngovernance and business activities.\n\n•\n\nThe client’s commitment to address the questionable issues, for example, through\nimproving corporate governance practices or internal controls.\n\n320.3 A3\n\nA self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care is\ncreated if the team does not possess, or cannot acquire, the competencies to perform the\nprofessional services.\n\n320.3 A4\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:\n•\n\n320.3 A5\n\nAn appropriate understanding of:\no\n\nThe nature of the client’s business;\n\no\n\nThe complexity of its operations;\n\no\n\nThe requirements of the engagement; and\n\no\n\nThe purpose, nature and scope of the work to be performed.\n\n•\n\nKnowledge of relevant industries or subject matter.\n\n•\n\nExperience with relevant regulatory or reporting requirements.\n\n•\n\nPolicies and procedures that the firm has implemented, as part of a system of quality\nmanagement in accordance with quality management standards such as ISQM 1, that\nrespond to quality risks relating to the firm’s ability to perform the engagement in\naccordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n•\n\nThe level of fees and the extent to which they have regard to the resources required, taking\ninto account the professional accountant’s commercial and market priorities.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nAssigning sufficient engagement personnel with the necessary competencies.\n\n•\n\nAgreeing on a realistic time frame for the performance of the engagement.\n\n•\n\nUsing experts where necessary.\n\nSECTION 320 Page 65 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nChanges in a Professional Appointment\nGeneral\nR320.4\n\nA professional accountant shall determine whether there are any reasons for not accepting an\nengagement when the accountant:\n(a)\n\nIs asked by a potential client to replace another accountant;\n\n(b)\n\nConsiders tendering for an engagement held by another accountant; or\n\n(c)\n\nConsiders undertaking work that is complementary or additional to that of another\naccountant.\n\n320.4 A1\n\nThere might be reasons for not accepting an engagement. One such reason might be if a threat\ncreated by the facts and circumstances cannot be addressed by applying safeguards. For\nexample, there might be a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional\ncompetence and due care if a professional accountant accepts the engagement before knowing\nall the relevant facts.\n\n320.4 A2\n\nIf a professional accountant is asked to undertake work that is complementary or additional to\nthe work of an existing or predecessor accountant, a self-interest threat to compliance with the\nprinciple of professional competence and due care might be created, for example, as a result of\nincomplete information.\n\n320.4 A3\n\nA factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat is whether tenders state that,\nbefore accepting the engagement, contact with the existing or predecessor accountant will be\nrequested. This contact gives the proposed accountant the opportunity to inquire whether there\nare any reasons why the engagement should not be accepted.\n\n320.4 A4\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nAsking the existing or predecessor accountant to provide any known information of which,\nin the existing or predecessor accountant’s opinion, the proposed accountant needs to be\naware before deciding whether to accept the engagement. For example, inquiry might\nreveal previously undisclosed pertinent facts and might indicate disagreements with the\nexisting or predecessor accountant that might influence the decision to accept the\nappointment.\n\n•\n\nObtaining information from other sources such as through inquiries of third parties or\nbackground investigations regarding senior management or those charged with\ngovernance of the client.\n\nCommunicating with the Existing or Predecessor Accountant\nR320.5\n\nHaving been asked to accept an appointment, the professional accountant shall at least\nseek to contact the existing or predecessor accountant, irrespective of whether the\nexisting or predecessor accountant works in public practice or not. This includes\ncircumstances where the professional accountant is asked to undertake work which is\nrelevant to the work of an ongoing existing accountant unless the client provides\nacceptable reasons why the existing accountant cannot be informed.\n\n320.5 A1\n\nA proposed accountant will usually need the client’s permission, preferably in writing, to initiate\ndiscussions with the existing or predecessor accountant.\n\nSECTION 320 Page 66 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n320.5A2\n\nR320.6\n\nCare must be taken when communicating all relevant facts to a proposed accountant\nin situations where the existing or predecessor accountant knows or suspects that\ntheir client is involved in money laundering or a terrorist activity. It is important that:\n•\n\nThe proposed accountant does not specifically enquire whether the existing\naccountant has reported suspicions of money laundering or terrorism. Such\nquestions place the existing accountant in a difficult position and are likely not\nto be answered.\n\n•\n\nThe proposed accountant does not ask the existing accountant whether client\nidentification or ‘knowing your client’ procedures have been carried out under\nanti-money laundering legislation. The proposed accountant has responsibility\nfor obtaining information for client identification and ‘knowing your client’ and\nthis cannot be delegated to the existing accountant.\n\nIf unable to communicate with the existing or predecessor accountant, the proposed accountant\nshall take other reasonable steps to obtain information about any possible threats.\n\nR320.6A\n\nIn circumstances where the enquiries referred to above are not answered, the\nproposed accountant shall write to the existing accountant by recorded delivery\nservice stating an intention to accept the engagement in the absence of a reply\nwithin a specific and reasonable period.\n\n320.6A1\n\nThe proposed accountant is entitled to assume that the existing accountant’s silence\nimplies there was no adverse comment to be made, although this does not obviate the\nrequirement in R320.6 to take other reasonable steps.\n\nCommunicating with the Proposed Accountant\nR320.7\n\nR320.7A\n\n320.7 A1\n\n320.7 A2\n\nWhen an existing or predecessor accountant is asked to respond to a communication from a\nproposed accountant, the existing or predecessor accountant shall:\n(a)\n\nComply with relevant laws and regulations governing the request; and\n\n(b)\n\nProvide any information honestly and unambiguously.\n\nIf the client fails or refuses to grant the existing accountant permission to discuss\nthe client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, the existing accountant shall report\nthis fact to the proposed accountant who shall consider carefully the reason for\nsuch failure or refusal when determining whether or not to accept\nnomination/appointment.\nAn existing or predecessor accountant is bound by confidentiality. Whether the existing or\npredecessor accountant is permitted or required to discuss the affairs of a client with a proposed\naccountant will depend on the nature of the engagement and:\n(a)\n\nWhether the existing or predecessor accountant has permission from the client for the\ndiscussion; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe legal and ethics requirements relating to such communications and disclosure, which\nmight vary by jurisdiction.\n\nCircumstances where a professional accountant is or might be required to disclose confidential\ninformation, or when disclosure might be appropriate, are set out in paragraph 114.3 A1 of the\nCode.\n\nSECTION 320 Page 67 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR320.7B\n\nIf the existing accountant has made one or more suspicious activity reports relating\nto money laundering or terrorism, the existing accountant shall not disclose that\nfact to the prospective accountant, or make other disclosures that could amount\nto tipping off.\n\n320.7 A3\n\nDisclosure of money laundering or terrorist suspicion reporting by the existing accountant\nto the proposed accountant needs to be avoided because this information may be\ndiscussed with the client or former client\n\nTransfer of records\nR320.7C\n\nAn existing accountant shall deal promptly with any reasonable request for the\ntransfer of records and may have the right of particular lien if there are unpaid fees.\n\nR320.7D\n\nThe prospective accountant often asks the existing accountant for information as\nto the client’s affairs. If the client is unable to provide the information and lack\nthereof might prejudice the client’s interests, such information shall be promptly\ngiven. In such circumstances, no charge shall normally be made unless there is\ngood reason to the contrary.\n\n320.7 A4\n\nAn example of a reason to make a charge would be that a significant amount of work is\ninvolved.\n\nChanges in Audit or Review Appointments\nR320.8\n\nIn the case of an audit or review of financial statements, a professional accountant shall request\nthe existing or predecessor accountant to provide known information regarding any facts or other\ninformation of which, in the existing or predecessor accountant’s opinion, the proposed\naccountant needs to be aware before deciding whether to accept the engagement. Except for\nthe circumstances involving non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and\nregulations set out in paragraphs R360.21 and R360.22:\n(a)\n\nIf the client consents to the existing or predecessor accountant disclosing any such facts\nor other information, the existing or predecessor accountant shall provide the information\nhonestly and unambiguously; and\n\n(b)\n\nIf the client fails or refuses to grant the existing or predecessor accountant permission to\ndiscuss the client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, the existing or predecessor\naccountant shall disclose this fact to the proposed accountant, who shall carefully consider\nsuch failure or refusal when determining whether to accept the appointment.\n\nClient and Engagement Continuance\nR320.9\n\nFor a recurring client engagement, a professional accountant shall periodically review whether\nto continue with the engagement.\n\n320.9 A1\n\nPotential threats to compliance with the fundamental principles might be created after acceptance\nwhich, had they been known earlier, would have caused the professional accountant to decline the\nengagement. For example, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of integrity might be\ncreated by improper earnings management or balance sheet valuations.\n\nUsing the Work of an Expert\nR320.10\n\nWhen a professional accountant intends to use the work of an expert in the course of undertaking\na professional activity, the accountant shall determine whether the use is appropriate for the\nintended purpose.\n\n320.10 A1\n\nFactors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the work of an expert include:\n•\n\nThe reputation and expertise of, and the resources available, to the expert.\n\n•\n\nWhether the expert is subject to applicable professional and ethics standards.\n\nSECTION 320 Page 68 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSuch information might be gained from prior association with, or from consulting others about,\nthe expert.\nUsing the Output of Technology\nR320.11\n\nWhen a professional accountant intends to use the output of technology in the course of\nundertaking a professional activity, the accountant shall determine whether the use is appropriate\nfor the intended purpose.\n\n320.11 A1 Factors to consider when a professional accountant intends to use the output of technology\ninclude:\n•\n\nThe nature of the activity to be performed by the technology.\n\n•\n\nThe expected use of, or extent of reliance on, the output of the technology.\n\n•\n\nWhether the accountant has the ability, or access to an expert with the ability, to\nunderstand, use and explain the technology and its appropriateness for the purpose\nintended.\n\n•\n\nWhether the technology used has been appropriately tested and evaluated for the purpose\nintended.\n\n•\n\nPrior experience with the technology and whether its use for specific purposes is generally\naccepted.\n\n•\n\nThe firm’s oversight of the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance,\nmonitoring, updating or upgrading of the technology.\n\n•\n\nThe controls relating to the use of the technology, including procedures for authorising user\naccess to the technology and overseeing such use.\n\n•\n\nThe appropriateness of the inputs to the technology, including data and any related\ndecisions, and decisions made by individuals in the course of using the technology.\n\nOther Considerations\n320.12 A1 When a professional accountant is considering using the work of experts or the output of\ntechnology, a consideration is whether the accountant is in a position within the firm to obtain\ninformation in relation to the factors necessary to determine whether such use is appropriate.\n\nSECTION 320 Page 69 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 321\nSECOND OPINIONS\nIntroduction\n321.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n321.2\n\nProviding a second opinion to an entity that is not an existing client might create a self-interest or\nother threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out\nspecific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in\nsuch circumstances.\n\nThis section does not apply to expert evidence assignments, opinions pursuant to litigation and opinions\nprovided jointly to other firms and their clients jointly.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR321.3\n\nA professional accountant shall, when providing a second opinion:\n(a) Confirm oral opinions in writing as soon as practicable after giving the opinion;\n(b) If asked for a general opinion relative to a hypothetical situation, ensure that the\nrecipient of the opinion understands that it has been given in the context of that\nparticular hypothetical situation only.\n\n321.3 A1\n\nA professional accountant might be asked to provide a second opinion on the application of\naccounting, auditing, reporting or other standards or principles to (a) specific circumstances, or\n(b) transactions by or on behalf of a company or an entity that is not an existing client. A threat,\nfor example, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence\nand due care, might be created if the second opinion is not based on the same facts that the\nexisting or predecessor accountant had, or is based on inadequate evidence.\n\n321.3 A2\n\nA factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of such a self-interest threat is the circumstances\nof the request and all the other available facts and assumptions relevant to the expression of a\nprofessional judgement.\n\n321.3 A3\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nWith the client’s permission, obtaining information from the existing or predecessor\naccountant.\n\n•\n\nDescribing the limitations surrounding any opinion in communications with the client.\n\n•\n\nProviding the existing or predecessor accountant with a copy of the opinion.\n\nWhen Permission to Communicate is Not Provided\nR321.4\n\n321.4 A1\n\nIf an entity seeking a second opinion from a professional accountant will not permit the\naccountant to communicate with the existing or predecessor accountant, the accountant shall\ndetermine whether the accountant may provide the second opinion sought.\nA professional accountant providing a second opinion will generally need to seek contact with\nthe existing or predecessor accountant (particularly if the existing accountant is engaged as\nauditor. This is necessary to ascertain the circumstances in which the consultation has been\nmade, and to be apprised of all the facts relevant to the issues at the time the opinion is given.\nIf the client will not allow the opinion giver to carry out the steps referred to above, it will\ngenerally be appropriate for the opinion-giver to decline to act, particularly if the existing\naccountant is engaged as auditor.\n\nSECTION 321 Page 70 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 325\nOBJECTIVITY OF AN ENGAGEMENT QUALITY REVIEWER AND OTHER\nAPPROPRIATE REVIEWERS\nIntroduction\n325.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n325.2\n\nAppointing an engagement quality reviewer who has involvement in the work being reviewed or\nclose relationships with those responsible for performing that work might create threats to\ncompliance with the principle of objectivity.\n\n325.3\n\nThis section sets out specific application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework\nin relation to the objectivity of an engagement quality reviewer.\n\n325.4\n\nAn engagement quality reviewer is also an example of an appropriate reviewer as described in\nparagraph 300.8 A4. Therefore, the application material in this section might apply in\ncircumstances where a professional accountant appoints an appropriate reviewer to review work\nperformed as a safeguard to address identified threats.\n\nApplication Material\nGeneral\n325.5 A1\n\nQuality engagements are achieved through planning and performing engagements and reporting\non them in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements. ISQM 1 establishes the firm’s responsibilities for its system of quality management\nand requires the firm to design and implement responses to address quality risks related to\nengagement performance. Such responses include establishing policies or procedures\naddressing engagement quality reviews in accordance with ISQM 2.\n\n325.5 A2\n\nAn engagement quality reviewer is a partner, other individual in the firm, or an external individual,\nappointed by the firm to perform the engagement quality review.\n\nIdentifying Threats\n325.6 A1\n\nThe following are examples of circumstances where threats to the objectivity of a professional\naccountant appointed as an engagement quality reviewer might be created:\n(a)\n\nSelf-interest threat\n•\n\n(b)\n\nSelf-review threat\n•\n\n(c)\n\nAn accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer on an audit engagement\nafter previously serving as the engagement partner.\n\nFamiliarity threat\n•\n\n(d)\n\nTwo engagement partners each serving as an engagement quality reviewer for the\nother’s engagement.\n\nAn accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer has a close relationship\nwith or is an immediate family member of another individual who is involved in the\nengagement.\n\nIntimidation threat\n•\n\nAn accountant serving as an engagement quality reviewer for an engagement has\na direct reporting line to the partner responsible for the engagement.\n\nEvaluating Threats\n325.7 A1\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats to the objectivity of an individual\nappointed as an engagement quality reviewer include:\n•\n\nThe role and seniority of the individual.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the individual’s relationship with others involved on the engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe length of time the individual was previously involved with the engagement and the\nSECTION 325 Page 71 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nindividual’s role.\n•\n\nWhen the individual was last involved in the engagement prior to being appointed as\nengagement quality reviewer and any subsequent relevant changes to the circumstances\nof the engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe nature and complexity of issues that required significant judgement from the individual\nin any previous involvement in the engagement.\n\nAddressing Threats\n325.8 A1\n\nAn example of an action that might eliminate an intimidation threat is reassigning reporting\nresponsibilities within the firm.\n\n325.8 A2\n\nAn example of an action that might be a safeguard to address a self-review threat is implementing\na period of sufficient duration (a cooling-off period) before the individual who was on the\nengagement is appointed as an engagement quality reviewer.\n\nCooling-off Period\n325.8 A3\n\nISQM 2 requires the firm to establish policies or procedures that specify, as a condition for\neligibility, a cooling-off period of two years before the engagement partner can assume the role\nof engagement quality reviewer. This serves to enable compliance with the principle of objectivity\nand the consistent performance of quality engagements.\n\n325.8 A4\n\nThe cooling-off period required by ISQM 2 is distinct from, and does not modify, the partner\nrotation requirements in Section 540, which are designed to address threats to independence\ncreated by long association with an audit client.\n\nSECTION 325 Page 72 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 330\nFEES AND OTHER TYPES OF REMUNERATION\nIntroduction\n330.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n330.2\n\nThe level and nature of fee and other remuneration arrangements might create a self-interest\nthreat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific\napplication material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.\n\nApplication Material\nLevel of Fees\n330.3 A1\n\nThe level of fees might impact a professional accountant’s ability to perform professional services\nin accordance with technical and professional standards.\n\n330.3 A2\n\nA professional accountant might quote whatever fee is considered appropriate. Quoting a fee\nlower than another accountant is not in itself unethical. However, the level of fees quoted creates\na self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care if\nthe fee quoted is so low that it might be difficult to perform the engagement in accordance with\napplicable technical and professional standards.\n\n330.3 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:\n\n330.3 A4\n\n•\n\nWhether the client is aware of the terms of the engagement and, in particular, the basis on\nwhich fees are determined and which professional services are covered.\n\n•\n\nWhether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party such as a regulatory body.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nAdjusting the level of fees or the scope of the engagement.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer review the work performed.\n\nSECTION 330 Page 73 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR330.4\n\nA professional accountant shall explain the basis on which fees will be calculated and\nprovide an estimated initial fee where applicable. A professional accountant shall give\nthe client this information at the earliest opportunity.\n\n330.4 A1\n\nFee levels are a commercial matter, but may be determined by:\n•\n\nThe seniority and expertise of the individuals performing the work;\n\n•\n\nTime spent;\n\n•\n\nThe risk and responsibility of the work;\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the client’s business;\n\n•\n\nThe priority and importance of the work to the client;\n\n•\n\nExpenses properly incurred.\n\nR330.5\n\nA professional accountant shall provide fee quotes or details of the basis of fees in\nwriting, either before the beginning of the engagement, or as soon as possible after the\nstart of the engagement. This information would normally be provided in the\nengagement letter. If there is no engagement letter, then the professional accountant\nshall provide a specific document containing these details.\n\nR330.6\n\nIf audit or assurance work has been obtained by a fee quote that is low compared to\nexisting fees, a professional accountant shall be aware of the risk of an actual or\nperceived self-interest threat. In particular, the risk of the perception that the objectivity\nor quality of the work could be compromised. A professional accountant shall ensure\nthat work for which the accountant is responsible complies with relevant standards,\nguidelines and regulations, in particular quality control.\n\nR330.7\n\nA professional accountant shall not mislead clients about the basis of fees for current\nor future work.\n\nContingent Fees\n330.4 A1\n\nContingent fees are used for certain types of non-assurance services. However, contingent fees\nmight create threats to compliance with the fundamental principles, particularly a self-interest\nthreat to compliance with the principle of objectivity, in certain circumstances.\n\n330.4 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such threats include:\n\n330.4 A3\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe range of possible fee amounts.\n\n•\n\nThe basis for determining the fee.\n\n•\n\nDisclosure to intended users of the work performed by the professional accountant and\nthe basis of remuneration.\n\n•\n\nQuality management policies and procedures.\n\n•\n\nWhether an independent third party is to review the outcome or result of the transaction.\n\n•\n\nWhether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party such as a regulatory body.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in performing the non-assurance\nservice review the work performed by the professional accountant.\n\n•\n\nObtaining an advance written agreement with the client on the basis of remuneration.\n\nSECTION 330 Page 74 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n330.4 A4\n\n330.4 A5\n\nRequirements and application material related to contingent fees for services provided to audit\nor review clients and other assurance clients are set out in International Independence\nStandards.\nFor formal appointments under the insolvency legislation e.g. bankruptcies, liquidations and\nadministrations, the professional accountant might be required by statute to base fees on a\npercentage of:\n•\n\nRealisations of value or property dealt with; or\n\n•\n\nDistributions,\n\nrather than the bases outlined in 330.4A1\n330.4 A6\n\nFor Corporate Finance services where no professional opinion is given, such as advising on:\n•\n\nManagement Buy-Ins;\n\n•\n\nManagement Buy-Outs;\n\n•\n\nRaising Venture Capital;\n\n•\n\nAcquisition searches; or\n\n•\n\nSales Mandates\n\nA contingent fee basis might be more appropriate than a fee calculated on the bases outlined\nin 330.4A1.\n330.4. A7\n\nDue to the higher level of risk and responsibility associated with Due Diligence assignments, it\nmay be appropriate to charge a higher fee for a transaction that completes, than for one that is\naborted.

See R112 Objectivity.\n\nReferral Fees or Commissions\n330.5 A1\n\nA self-interest threat to compliance with the principles of objectivity and professional competence\nand due care is created if a professional accountant pays or receives a referral fee or receives a\ncommission relating to a client. Such referral fees or commissions include, for example:\n•\n\nA fee paid to another professional accountant for the purposes of obtaining new client work\nwhen the client continues as a client of the existing accountant but requires specialist\nservices not offered by that accountant.\nSECTION 330 Page 75 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n330.5 A2\n\n•\n\nA fee received for referring a continuing client to another professional accountant or other\nexpert where the existing accountant does not provide the specific professional service\nrequired by the client.\n\n•\n\nA commission received from a third party (for example, a software vendor) in connection\nwith the sale of goods or services to a client.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nObtaining an advance agreement from the client for commission arrangements in\nconnection with the sale by another party of goods or services to the client might address\na self-interest threat.\n\n•\n\nDisclosing to clients any referral fees or commission arrangements paid to, or received\nfrom, another professional accountant or third party for recommending services or products\nmight address a self-interest threat.\n\nSECTION 330 Page 76 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR330.5B\n\nIf a professional accountant, or an associate, receives any kind of fee, commission,\npayment, or benefit (“the commission”) in connection with the referral of the\nprofessional accountant’s client, the professional accountant shall obtain explicit\nwritten consent to retain the commission. This requirement exists regardless of the\namount of the commission. Client consent shall be achieved one of in the following\nways:\na)\n\nb)\n\nA professional accountant may include a clause in their engagement letter that\nspecifies that the firm will retain commission payments received in relation to\nreferrals of the client to third parties. The clause shall state that by the client\nsigning the engagement letter they are providing consent to the firm retaining the\ncommission. The engagement letter shall include examples that provide a fair\nindication of the amount of expected commission. If the amount of commission\nreceived is significantly in excess of the amounts indicated in the engagement\nletter, the firm shall also write to the client promptly following receipt of the\ncommission and shall specify:\n•\n\nThe amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission received;\n\n•\n\nWhat the commission was received for;\n\n•\n\nHow the commission was calculated;\n\n•\n\nThe payer and payee of the commission.\n\nIf there is no general clause in the engagement letter which provides a fair\nindication of the expected commission, a professional accountant may obtain\nadvance specific written consent for the receipt of any commission. This consent\nfrom the client shall detail:\n•\n\nThe amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission the\nprofessional accountant will receive;\n\n•\n\nWhat the commission will be received for;\n\n•\n\nHow the commission will be calculated;\n\n•\n\nThe payer and payee of the commission.\n\nA professional accountant shall obtain explicit written consent from the client for\nthe commission payment to be retained.\nc)\n\nIf advance consent has not been obtained either in general (point a) or specifically\n(point b), a professional accountant shall make full disclosure to the client within\na reasonable period of time following receipt of the commission. The professional\naccountant shall provide the following details to the client in writing:\n•\n\nThe amount and if relevant the frequency of the commission the\nprofessional accountant has received;\n\n•\n\nWhat the commission was received for;\n\n•\n\nHow the commission was calculated;\n\n•\n\nThe payer and payee of the commission.\n\nThe professional accountant shall ask the client for explicit written consent for the\ncommission payment to be retained. If a professional accountant has made\nreasonable efforts to obtain written consent from the client for retention of the\n\nSECTION 330 Page 77 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\ncommission, but the client has not responded, then the professional accountant\nmay presume consent to retain the commission. The professional accountant\nwould however need to demonstrate that they had made reasonable efforts to\nobtain consent.\n330.5B. A1 Where a professional accountant acts as agent for a client, or gives them professional advice,\nthere will be a fiduciary relationship between the professional accountant and the client. This\nmeans that the professional accountant has a legal obligation to obtain informed consent from\nthe client, if the professional accountant wants to retain any commission, fee, or other benefit\nreceived from a third party in connection with the referral of the client.\n330.5B. A2 The term ‘associate’ of a professional accountant includes the following:\n•\n\nA close or immediate family member;.\n\n•\n\nA business partner;\n\n•\n\nAny company or business in which there are common shareholdings with the\nprofessional accountant’s company or business, or which have the same beneficial\nowner(s); or one of the companies or business controls or owns the other.\n\n330.5B. A3 The examples of associates are not exhaustive, and the substance of the association between\nthe professional accountant and the recipient of the commission should be considered.\n330.5B.A4\n\nA professional accountant might consider that a payment the professional accountant receives\nin connection with the referral of a client, is in substance a fee for services rendered, and not\ncommission. In these circumstances the professional accountant should be able to\ndemonstrate that the fee received is not disproportionate to the scope of the services provided.\nThe fee should nevertheless be disclosed to the client with details of what services the fee\nrepresents.\n\nPurchase or Sale of a Firm\n330.6 A1\n\nA professional accountant may purchase all or part of another firm on the basis that payments\nwill be made to individuals formerly owning the firm or to their heirs or estates. Such payments\nare not referral fees or commissions for the purposes of this section\n\nSECTION 330 Page 78 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 331\nAGENCIES AND REFERRALS\nIntroduction\n331.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n331.2\n\nIf a professional accountant receives referred work, refers work to others, or establishes an\nagency arrangement, this might create a self-interest threat to compliance with one or more of\nthe fundamental principles. A referral may be a formal request made in the course of a\nprofessional relationship, for advice on the selection of a potential professional adviser. A\nreferral may also be an informal request, including where there is no existing relationship\nbetween the professional accountant and the enquirer. This section sets out specific application\nmaterial relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.\n\n331.3\n\nThe requirements in respect of referral fees are detailed in section 330.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nDuty of Care\n331.4 A1\n\nWhen a professional accountant makes a referral, a duty of care may arise. The extent of a\nduty of care varies according to the circumstances, including whether the exchange or\nprovision of information was solicited or not. A greater duty of care will arise for matters which\nare reasonably expected to be within a professional accountant’s knowledge or where a fee is\ncharged. A professional accountant needs to consider the expectations of their knowledge from\nthe client’s or enquirer’s perspective:\n•\n\nWhere a referral fee is received, or where the service referred is in a professional\nsphere, the client (or enquirer) can reasonably presume knowledge by the professional\naccountant. Any limitation in knowledge would clearly need to be explained.\n\n•\n\nWhere the enquiry relates to a service outside the normal sphere of expertise of an\naccountant, and no referral fee is contemplated, then it is reasonable to presume that\nthe enquiry is being made in a personal capacity, unless circumstances suggest\notherwise. It is still advisable to express any limitations of knowledge and to clarify, in\ncase of doubt, that any opinion is based on personal experience rather than in a\nprofessional capacity.\n\nR331.5\n\nProfessional accountants shall consider whether it would be in their interest for any\nknowledge limitations to be disclosed in writing, according to the circumstances.\n\n331.5 A1\n\nFactors that are relevant in such a consideration include:\n•\n\nThe nature of the professional relationship with the enquirer (an existing client,\nsomeone who could reasonably be considered to be making the enquiry as a\nprospective client or a casual enquiry).\n\n•\n\nThe context in which the enquiry is made. Is it professional or personal, casual or\nformal?\n\nSECTION 331 Page 79 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the personal relationship. Does the enquirer know the professional\naccountant is a Chartered Accountant and are they consulting them as a respected\nprofessional?\n\n•\n\nThe scope of enquiry and whether a referral fee is contemplated, as considered in\nsection 330.\n\n•\n\nThe enquirer’s expectations.\n\nR331.6\n\nThe professional accountants shall consider the fitness for purpose of the third party to\nwhom a referral is proposed, to address the client’s needs.\n\n331.6 A1\n\nA referral arises typically, when the professional accountant does not have the expertise and/or\nresource in house to undertake the potential engagement. It follows that the professional\naccountant will not necessarily know enough to be able completely to assess whether the third\nparty is the optimum choice or not. This is an inevitable limitation in most referrals, and what\nthe referral is based on will vary.\n\n331.6 A2\n\nIn making that consideration of fitness for purpose, the professional accountant:\n•\n\nCan take account of the professional or regulatory status of the prospective referee.\n\nR331.7\n\nA professional accountant shall not make a referral to a third party, even with a\ndisclaimer, if they know of a better alternative. Where the referral relates to an end\nproduct or service, rather than an intermediary, and the professional accountant knows\nthere are other alternatives but does not know if they are better, this shall be explained.\n\n331.7 A1\n\nIf the client or enquirer insists on being referred to a particular third party and the professional\naccountant believes there is a better alternative, the reference may be made but the client or\nenquirer should be made aware of the professional accountant’s concerns.\n\nR331.8\n\nIf the professional accountant has a relationship with the third party, for example a\nfamily connection or an automatic referral arrangement, there are clear self-interest or\nfamiliarity threats and the connection shall be disclosed.\n\n331.8 A1\n\nThis is particularly important where a professional accountant is considering recommending\nthe products of another supplier with which there is an agency, and/or a principal or employee\nof the professional accountant’s firm is a principal or officer of the other supplier.\n\n331.8 A2\n\nThe requirement to disclose includes situations where in substance there is a one-to-one\nrelationship between the professional accountant and the third party (for example, the\nprofessional accountant is the only accountant in the area and the third party is the only\nsolicitor), as this implies automatic referral.\n\n331.9 A1\n\nIn summary, the duty of care requirements and application material in 331.4 A1 to 331.8 A2\nmean that professional accountants should:\n•\n\nConsider any factors they are aware of that would indicate the proposed third party is\nnot fit for purpose in terms of the potential engagement. The professional accountant\nshould take into account what a reasonable person might expect a Chartered\nAccountant to know;\n\n•\n\nMake clients (or enquirers), that are proposed to be referred, aware of limitations in\nknowledge;\n\n•\n\nDisclose any referral arrangement and any potential benefit they will receive;\n\nSECTION 331 Page 80 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nEnsure that any contractual arrangement does not override the needs of an individual\nclient.\n\nEstablishing Agencies\n331.10\n\nThe guidance which follows is intended to assist professional accountants in their\narrangements with other suppliers of services and products. It addresses agreements that in\neffect provide for permanent arrangements for referrals. The issues are considered to be similar\nto those above for referrals in general except that an agency contract will usually bind the agent\nin terms of whom it can refer to for particular types of work.\n\nR331.11\n\nWhen professional accountants are considering the establishment of an agency, the\nterms of the agency contract (actual or implied) shall not require exclusive referral of all\nclients regardless of suitability.\n\n331.11 A1\n\nFor example, professional accountants could not be party to an agency by which they are\nconstrained to channel all funds received by it for investment into a single bank/building society.\nSuch a clause would make important safeguards inoperable.\n\nR331.12\n\nBefore accepting appointment as auditor or assurance provider of another entity of\nwhich they are an agent, professional accountants shall consider whether the agency\nconstitutes a material business relationship and thus breach the independence\nrequirements in Part 4.\n\nR331.13\n\nprofessional accountants shall not, because of the self-interest threat, enter into any\nfinancial arrangements with another supplier either personally or through their firm\nwhich would prejudice the objectivity of themselves or their firm.\n\nR331.14\n\nBefore accepting or continuing an agency with another supplier, professional\naccountants should satisfy themselves that their ability to discharge their professional\nobligations to their clients is not compromised.\n\nR331.15\n\nA professional accountant shall not in any circumstances conduct his or her practice in\nsuch a manner as to give the impression that the professional accountant is a principal\nrather than an agent.\n\n331.15 A1\n\nThis includes considering signs on premises and any other outward signs or literature used.\nThis would relate in particular to agencies with entities such as banks and building societies,\nwhere confusion as to status can arise.\n\nInvestment Business Agencies and Introductions\nR331.17\n\nWhen considering referrals of investment business (‘introductions’) or the\nestablishment of investment business agencies, professional accountants shall apply\nthe general principles and requirements set out above.\n\n331.17 A1\n\nAdditional considerations will include:\n•\n\nWhether the introduction or agency is permitted by regulation; and\n\n•\n\nWhether the status of the third party investment business provider is compatible with\nthe requirement to give objective advice.\n\nRegulated activities under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (United Kingdom)\n331.18 A1\n\nIn order to make a decision about whether an introduction is a regulated activity, a professional\naccountant must look at how the introduction is made and also what type of investment the\nSECTION 331 Page 81 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nclient is considering (such as life assurance and pensions, unit trusts, shares, mortgages or\ngeneral insurance). A regulated introduction can only be made under the terms of the Act by a\nfirm which is licensed by ICAEW as a Designated Professional Body (‘DPB’) (a licensed firm)\nor a firm which is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘authorised’). Unauthorised /\nunlicensed firms are restricted in that they can only make introductions for general financial\nadvice where no specific type of investment is referred to, or for a restricted range of\ninvestments, such as shares and unit trusts. Further guidance can be found in the DPB\nHandbook.\nR331.19\n\nHaving established that an introduction can be made in compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, professional accountants shall bear in mind the need to provide their\nclients with objective advice, in compliance with these ethical standards.\n\nR331.20\n\nProfessional accountants might become appointed representatives of another\nauthorised firm. When selecting which authorised firm to become an appointed\nrepresentative of, professional accountants shall again bear in mind the need to provide\ntheir clients with objective advice.\n\nStatus of Investment Business Providers\n331.23 A1\n\nConsiderations in implementing the above requirements when becoming an agent of an\nauthorised firm are summarised below.\nAuthorised firms within the\nUnited Kingdom may fall into\nthe following categories:\n\nWhat recommendations the\nfirm may make\n\nMay there generally be\nintroductions to this type of\nfirm?\n\nIndependent\n\nA firm provides independent\nadvice across all markets\nand all retail investment\nproducts\n\nYes (331.24 A1 below)\n\nRestricted\n\nA firm provides independent\nadvice in respect of a\nrelevant market that does\nnot\ninclude\nall\nretail\ninvestment products (but\ndoes include all retail\ninvestment products within\nthe relevant market)\n\nDepends (R331.25 below)\n\nType of firm\n\nA firm provides restricted\nadvice (being advice which\nis not as described above)\n\nDepends on scope of choice\n(R331.26 below)\n\nFurther information and the definitions of independent and restricted is available in the FCA\nHandbook.\n\nSECTION 331 Page 82 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n331.24 A1\n\nAn introduction to independent firms (category (a) only for the UK table above) would be likely\nto meet the requirement to give objective advice but professional accountants are reminded of\nthe general requirements above.\n\nR331.25\n\nProfessional accountants shall apply the guidance in Sections 331.1 to 331.8. in respect\nof recommendations to firms providing independent advice in respect of a relevant\nmarket that does not include all retail investment products.\n\n331.25 A1\n\nWhether they can make such recommendations will depend upon whether the relevant markets\ncovered are appropriate to the client’s requirements and on whether, within those markets, the\nfirm places business with the product providers who account for a large majority of the relevant\nmarket or offer the sector of the market which is most suitable for the client’s needs. The latter\naspect is discussed further in 331.27 A1 below in the context of restricted advice but similar\nprinciples apply.\n\nR331.26\n\nIf considering an introduction to a restricted firm, professional accountants shall apply\nthe guidance in 331.1 to 331.8 above. professional accountants shall assess the client’s\nrequirements and whether the restricted firm places business with the product\nproviders who account for a large majority of the relevant market or offer the sector of\nthe market which is most suitable for the client’s needs. If making such a referral, the\nprofessional accountant shall make the client aware of restrictions in the range of\ninvestments offered by the firm to which the client is being referred.\n\n331.26 A1\n\nProfessional accountants may in some situations be able to introduce to restricted firms and\nstill comply with the ethical requirements (however, see 331.18 A1 and R331.19 above as to\nwhether the introduction can only be made by a DPB licensed firm or an FCA authorised firm,\nif it is a ‘regulated’ activity). Whether an introduction to a restricted firm will be acceptable will\ndepend on the particular circumstances and the scope of the available choice. The principal\nthreat is that clients might not be offered the most appropriate choice. However, professional\naccountants need to ensure that in making such an assessment, they are not effectively making\ntheir own recommendation unless they are able to do so under the terms of a licence or\nauthorisation. The professional accountant may decide that this does not restrict the client’s\naccess to the range of product providers to an extent where there is any potential detriment.\n\n331.27 A1\n\nSimilar considerations to those noted above apply to whether a professional accountant shall\nbecome an appointed representative under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Thus,\nfor example, a professional firm cannot become an appointed representative for regulated\ninvestment business, of a restricted firm if the agency agreement would obliged the firm to\nmake referrals to the principal in all circumstances and the firm would be unable to provide\nobjective advice.\n\nSECTION 331 Page 83 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 340\nINDUCEMENTS, INCLUDING GIFTS AND HOSPITALITY\nIntroduction\n340.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n340.2\n\nOffering or accepting inducements might create a self-interest, familiarity or intimidation threat to\ncompliance with the fundamental principles, particularly the principles of integrity, objectivity and\nprofessional behaviour.\n\n340.3\n\nThis section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual\nframework in relation to the offering and accepting of inducements when performing professional\nservices that does not constitute non-compliance with laws and regulations. This section also\nrequires a professional accountant to comply with relevant laws and regulations when offering or\naccepting inducements.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n340.4 A1\n\nAn inducement is an object, situation, or action that is used as a means to influence another\nindividual’s behaviour, but not necessarily with the intent to improperly influence that individual’s\nbehaviour. inducements can range from minor acts of hospitality between professional\naccountants and existing or prospective clients to acts that result in non-compliance with laws\nand regulations. An inducement can take many different forms, for example:\n•\n\nGifts.\n\n•\n\nHospitality.\n\n•\n\nEntertainment.\n\n•\n\nPolitical or charitable donations.\n\n•\n\nAppeals to friendship and loyalty.\n\n•\n\nEmployment or other commercial opportunities.\n\n•\n\nPreferential treatment, rights or privileges.\n\nInducements Prohibited by Laws and Regulations\nR340.5\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and\ncorruption, that prohibit the offering or accepting of inducements in certain circumstances. The\nprofessional accountant shall obtain an understanding of relevant laws and regulations and\ncomply with them when the accountant encounters such circumstances.\n\nInducements Not Prohibited by Laws and Regulations\n340.6 A1\n\nThe offering or accepting of inducements that is not prohibited by laws and regulations might still\ncreate threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.\n\nInducements with Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour\nR340.7\n\nA professional accountant shall not offer, or encourage others to offer, any inducement that is\nmade, or which the accountant considers a reasonable and informed third party would be likely\nto conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of\nanother individual.\n\nR340.8\n\nA professional accountant shall not accept, or encourage others to accept, any inducement that\nthe accountant concludes is made, or considers a reasonable and informed third party would be\nlikely to conclude is made, with the intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the recipient\nor of another individual.\n\n340.9 A1\n\nAn inducement is considered as improperly influencing an individual’s behaviour if it causes the\nindividual to act in an unethical manner. Such improper influence can be directed either towards\nthe recipient or towards another individual who has some relationship with the recipient. The\nSECTION 340 Page 84 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nfundamental principles are an appropriate frame of reference for a professional accountant in\nconsidering what constitutes unethical behaviour on the part of the accountant and, if necessary\nby analogy, other individuals.\n340.9 A2\n\nA breach of the fundamental principle of integrity arises when a professional accountant offers\nor accepts, or encourages others to offer or accept, an inducement where the intent is to\nimproperly influence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.\n\n340.9 A3\n\nThe determination of whether there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence behaviour\nrequires the exercise of professional judgement. Relevant factors to consider might include:\n•\n\nThe nature, frequency, value and cumulative effect of the inducement.\n\n•\n\nTiming of when the inducement is offered relative to any action or decision that it might\ninfluence.\n\n•\n\nWhether the inducement is a customary or cultural practice in the circumstances, for\nexample, offering a gift on the occasion of a religious holiday or wedding.\n\n•\n\nWhether the inducement is an ancillary part of a professional service, for example, offering\nor accepting lunch in connection with a business meeting.\n\n•\n\nWhether the offer of the inducement is limited to an individual recipient or available to a\nbroader group. The broader group might be internal or external to the firm, such as other\nsuppliers to the client.\n\n•\n\nThe roles and positions of the individuals at the firm or the client offering or being offered\nthe inducement.\n\n•\n\nWhether the professional accountant knows, or has reason to believe, that accepting the\ninducement would breach the policies and procedures of the client.\n\n•\n\nThe degree of transparency with which the inducement is offered.\n\n•\n\nWhether the inducement was required or requested by the recipient.\n\n•\n\nThe known previous behaviour or reputation of the offeror.\n\nConsideration of Further Actions\n340.10 A1\n\nIf the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered with actual or perceived\nintent to improperly influence behaviour, threats to compliance with the fundamental principles\nmight still be created even if the requirements in paragraphs R340.7 and R340.8 are met.\n\n340.10 A2\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:\n•\n\nInforming senior management of the firm or those charged with governance of the client\nregarding the offer.\n\n•\n\nAmending or terminating the business relationship with the client.\n\nInducements with No Intent to Improperly Influence Behaviour\n340.11 A1\n\nThe requirements and application material set out in the conceptual framework apply when a\nprofessional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to improperly\ninfluence the behaviour of the recipient or of another individual.\n\n340.11 A2\n\nIf such an inducement is trivial and inconsequential, any threats created will be at an acceptable\nlevel.\n\n340.11 A3\n\nExamples of circumstances where offering or accepting such an inducement might create threats\neven if the professional accountant has concluded there is no actual or perceived intent to\nimproperly influence behaviour include:\n•\n\nSelf-interest threats\no\n\nA professional accountant is offered hospitality from the prospective acquirer of a\nclient while providing corporate finance services to the client.\n\nSECTION 340 Page 85 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nFamiliarity threats\no\n\n•\n\nA professional accountant regularly takes an existing or prospective client to sporting\nevents.\n\nIntimidation threats\no\n\nA professional accountant accepts hospitality from a client, the nature of which could\nbe perceived to be inappropriate were it to be publicly disclosed.\n\n340.11 A4\n\nRelevant factors in evaluating the level of such threats created by offering or accepting such an\ninducement include the same factors set out in paragraph 340.9 A3 for determining intent.\n\n340.11 A5\n\nExamples of actions that might eliminate threats created by offering or accepting such an\ninducement include:\n\n340.11 A6\n\n•\n\nDeclining or not offering the inducement.\n\n•\n\nTransferring responsibility for the provision of any professional services to the client to\nanother individual who the professional accountant has no reason to believe would be, or\nwould be perceived to be, improperly influenced when providing the services.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats created by offering or\naccepting such an inducement include:\n•\n\nBeing transparent with senior management of the firm or of the client about offering or\naccepting an inducement.\n\n•\n\nRegistering the inducement in a log monitored by senior management of the firm or another\nindividual responsible for the firm’s ethics compliance or maintained by the client.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer, who is not otherwise involved in providing the professional\nservice, review any work performed or decisions made by the professional accountant with\nrespect to the client from which the accountant accepted the inducement.\n\n•\n\nDonating the inducement to charity after receipt and appropriately disclosing the donation,\nfor example, to a member of senior management of the firm or the individual who offered\nthe inducement.\n\n•\n\nReimbursing the cost of the inducement, such as hospitality, received.\n\n•\n\nAs soon as possible, returning the inducement, such as a gift, after it was initially accepted.\n\nImmediate or Close Family Members\nR340.12\n\nA professional accountant shall remain alert to potential threats to the accountant’s compliance\nwith the fundamental principles created by the offering of an inducement:\n(a)\n\nBy an immediate or close family member of the accountant to an existing or prospective\nclient of the accountant.\n\n(b)\n\nTo an immediate or close family member of the accountant by an existing or prospective\nclient of the accountant.\n\nR340.13\n\nWhere the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement being offered to or made\nby an immediate or close family member and concludes there is intent to improperly influence\nthe behaviour of the accountant or of an existing or prospective client of the accountant, or\nconsiders a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude such intent exists,\nthe accountant shall advise the immediate or

improperly influence the behaviour of the professional accountant or of the\nexisting or prospective client. Another factor that is relevant is the nature or closeness of the\nrelationship, between:\n(a)\n\nThe accountant and the immediate or close family member;\n\n(b)\n\nThe immediate or close family member and the existing or prospective client; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe accountant and the existing or prospective client.\n\nSECTION 340 Page 86 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nFor example, the offer of employment, outside of the normal recruitment process, to the spouse\nof the accountant by a client for whom the accountant is providing a business valuation for a\nprospective sale might indicate such intent.\n340.13 A2\n\nThe application material in paragraph 340.10 A2 is also relevant in addressing threats that might\nbe created when there is actual or perceived intent to improperly influence the behaviour of the\nprofessional accountant, or of the existing or prospective client even if the immediate or close\nfamily member has followed the advice given pursuant to paragraph R340.13.\n\nApplication of the Conceptual Framework\n340.14 A1\n\n340.14 A2\n\nWhere the professional accountant becomes aware of an inducement offered in the\ncircumstances addressed in paragraph R340.12, threats to compliance with the fundamental\nprinciples might be created where:\n(a)\n\nThe immediate or close family member offers or accepts the inducement contrary to the\nadvice of the accountant pursuant to paragraph R340.13; or\n\n(b)\n\nThe accountant does not have reason to believe an actual or perceived intent to improperly\ninfluence the behaviour of the accountant or of the existing or prospective client exists.\n\nThe application material in paragraphs 340.11 A1 to 340.11 A6 is relevant for the purposes of\nidentifying, evaluating and addressing such threats.

This section sets out specific requirements and\napplication material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nBefore Taking Custody\nR350.3\n\nA professional accountant shall not assume custody of client money or other assets unless\npermitted to do so by law and in accordance with any conditions under which such custody may\nbe taken.\n\nR350.4\n\nAs part of client and engagement acceptance procedures related to assuming custody of client\nmoney or assets, a professional accountant shall:\n\n350.4 A1\n\n(a)\n\nMake inquiries about the source of the assets; and\n\n(b)\n\nConsider related legal and regulatory obligations.\n\nInquiries about the source of client assets might reveal, for example, that the assets were derived\nfrom illegal activities, such as money laundering. In such circumstances, a threat would be\ncreated and the provisions of Section 360 would apply.\n\nAfter Taking Custody\nR350.5\n\nA professional accountant entrusted with money or other assets belonging to others shall:\n(a)\n\nComply with the laws and regulations relevant to holding and accounting for the assets;\n\n(b)\n\nKeep the assets separately from personal or firm assets;\n\n(c)\n\nUse the assets only for the purpose for which they are intended; and\n\n(d)\n\nBe ready at all times to account for the assets and any income, dividends, or gains\ngenerated, to any individuals entitled to that accounting.\n\nProfessional accountants should also refer to the latest versions of the following sources of information:\n-The Client Money Regulations\n-The DPB Handbook\n-The AML Guidance for the Accountancy Sector\n\nSECTION 350 Page 88 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 360\nRESPONDING TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nIntroduction\n360.1\n\nProfessional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats.\n\n360.2\n\nA self-interest or intimidation threat to compliance with the principles of integrity and professional\nbehaviour is created when a professional accountant becomes aware of non-compliance or\nsuspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\n360.3\n\nA professional accountant might encounter or be made aware of non-compliance or suspected\nnon-compliance in the course of providing a professional service to a client. This section guides\nthe accountant in assessing the implications of the matter and the possible courses of action\nwhen responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with:\n(a)\n\nLaws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of\nmaterial amounts and disclosures in the client’s financial statements; and\n\n(b)\n\nOther laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the\namounts and disclosures in the client’s financial statements, but compliance with which\nmight be fundamental to the operating aspects of the client’s business, to its ability to\ncontinue its business, or to avoid material penalties.\n\nObjectives of the Professional Accountant in Relation to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations\n360.4\n\nA distinguishing mark of the accountancy profession is its acceptance of the responsibility to act\nin the public interest. When responding to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the\nobjectives of the professional accountant are:\n(a)\n\nTo comply with the principles of integrity and professional behaviour;\n\n(b)\n\nBy alerting management or, where appropriate, those charged with governance of the\nclient, to seek to:\n\n(c)\n\n(i)\n\nEnable them to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the identified or\nsuspected non-compliance; or\n\n(ii)\n\nDeter the commission of the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; and\n\nTo take such further action as appropriate in the public interest.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n360.5 A1\n\n360.5 A2\n\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations (“non-compliance”) comprises acts of omission or\ncommission, intentional or unintentional, which are contrary to the prevailing laws or regulations\ncommitted by the following parties:\n(a)\n\nA client;\n\n(b)\n\nThose charged with governance of a client;\n\n(c)\n\nManagement of a client; or\n\n(d)\n\nOther individuals working for or under the direction of a client.\n\nExamples of laws and regulations which this section addresses include those that deal with:\n•\n\nFraud, corruption and bribery.\n\n•\n\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and proceeds of crime.\n\n•\n\nSecurities markets and trading.\n\n•\n\nBanking and other financial products and services.\n\n•\n\nData protection.\n\n•\n\nTax and pension liabilities and payments.\n\nSECTION 360 Page 89 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nEnvironmental protection.\n\n•\n\nPublic health and safety.\n\n360.5 A3\n\nNon-compliance might result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the client, potentially\nmaterially affecting its financial statements. Importantly, such non-compliance might have wider\npublic interest implications in terms of potentially substantial harm to investors, creditors,\nemployees or the general public. For the purposes of this section, an act that causes substantial\nharm is one that results in serious adverse consequences to any of these parties in financial or\nnon-financial terms. Examples include the perpetration of a fraud resulting in significant financial\nlosses to investors, and breaches of environmental laws and regulations endangering the health\nor safety of employees or the public.\n\nR360.6\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are legal or regulatory provisions governing how professional\naccountants should address non-compliance or suspected non-compliance. These legal or\nregulatory provisions might differ from or go beyond the provisions in this section. When\nencountering such non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall obtain\nan understanding of those legal or regulatory provisions and comply with them, including:\n(a)\n\nAny requirement to report the matter to an appropriate authority; and\n\n(b)\n\nAny prohibition on alerting the client.\n\n360.6 A1\n\nA prohibition on alerting the client might arise, for example, pursuant to anti-money laundering\nlegislation.\n\n360.7 A1\n\nThis section applies regardless of the nature of the client, including whether or not it is a public\ninterest entity.\n\n360.7 A2\n\nA professional accountant who encounters or is made aware of matters that are clearly\ninconsequential is not required to comply with this section. Whether a matter is clearly\ninconsequential is to be judged with respect to its nature and its impact, financial or otherwise,\non the client, its stakeholders and the general public.\n\n360.7 A3\n\nThis section does not address:\n(a)\n\nPersonal misconduct unrelated to the business activities of the client; and\n\n(b)\n\nNon-compliance by parties other than those specified in paragraph 360.5 A1. This\nincludes, for example, circumstances where a professional accountant has been engaged\nby a client to perform a due diligence assignment on a third party entity and the identified\nor suspected non-compliance has been committed by that third-party.\n\nThe accountant might nevertheless find the guidance in this section helpful in considering how\nto respond in these situations.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance\n360.8 A1\n\nManagement, with the oversight of those charged with governance, is responsible for ensuring\nthat the client’s business activities are conducted in accordance with laws and regulations.\nManagement and those charged with governance are also responsible for identifying and\naddressing any non-compliance by:\n(a)\n\nThe client;\n\n(b)\n\nAn individual charged with governance of the entity;\n\n(c)\n\nA member of management; or\n\n(d)\n\nOther individuals working for or under the direction of the client.\n\nResponsibilities of All Professional Accountants\nR360.9\n\nWhere a professional accountant becomes aware of a matter to which this section applies, the\nsteps that the accountant takes to comply with this section shall be taken on a timely basis. In\ntaking timely steps, the accountant shall have regard to the nature of the matter and the potential\nharm to the interests of the entity, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.\n\nSECTION 360 Page 90 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nAudits of Financial Statements\nObtaining an Understanding of the Matter\nR360.10\n\nIf a professional accountant engaged to perform an audit of financial statements becomes aware\nof information concerning non-compliance or suspected non-compliance, the accountant shall\nobtain an understanding of the matter. This understanding shall include the nature of the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance and the circumstances in which it has occurred or\nmight occur.\n\n360.10 A1\n\nThe professional accountant might become aware of the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in the course of performing the engagement or through information provided by other\nparties.\n\n360.10 A2\n\nThe professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise\nprofessional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of knowledge\nof laws and regulations greater than that which is required to undertake the engagement.\nWhether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be determined by a court or\nother appropriate adjudicative body.\n\n360.10 A3\n\nDepending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might\nconsult on a confidential basis with others within the firm, a network firm or a professional body,\nor with legal counsel.\n\nR360.11\n\nIf the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might\noccur, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the appropriate level of management and,\nwhere appropriate, those charged with governance.\n\n360.11 A1\n\nThe purpose of the discussion is to clarify the professional accountant’s understanding of the\nfacts and circumstances relevant to the matter and its potential consequences. The discussion\nalso might prompt management or those charged with governance to investigate the matter.\n\n360.11 A2\n\nThe appropriate level of management with whom to discuss the matter is a question of\nprofessional judgement. Relevant factors to consider include:\n•\n\nThe nature and circumstances of the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe individuals actually or potentially involved.\n\n•\n\nThe likelihood of collusion.\n\n•\n\nThe potential consequences of the matter.\n\n•\n\nWhether that level of management is able to investigate the matter and take appropriate\naction.\n\n360.11 A3\n\nThe appropriate level of management is usually at least one level above the individual or\nindividuals involved or potentially involved in the matter. In the context of a group, the appropriate\nlevel might be management at an entity that controls the client.\n\n360.11 A4\n\nThe professional accountant might also consider discussing the matter with internal auditors,\nwhere applicable.\n\nR360.12\n\nIf the professional accountant believes that management is involved in the non-compliance or\nsuspected non-compliance, the accountant shall discuss the matter with those charged with\ngovernance.\n\nAddressing the Matter\nR360.13\n\nR360.14\n\nIn discussing the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with management and, where\nappropriate, those charged with governance, the professional accountant shall advise them to\ntake appropriate and timely actions, if they have not already done so, to:\n(a)\n\nRectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of the non-compliance;\n\n(b)\n\nDeter the commission of the non-compliance where it has not yet occurred; or\n\n(c)\n\nDisclose the matter to an appropriate authority where required by law or regulation or\nwhere considered necessary in the public interest.\n\nThe professional accountant shall consider whether management and those charged with\ngovernance understand their legal or regulatory responsibilities with respect to the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance.\nSECTION 360 Page 91 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n360.14 A1\n\nIf management and those charged with governance do not understand their legal or regulatory\nresponsibilities with respect to the matter, the professional accountant might suggest appropriate\nsources of information or recommend that they obtain legal advice.\n\nR360.15\n\nThe professional accountant shall comply with applicable:\n\n360.15 A1\n\n(a)\n\nLaws and regulations, including legal or regulatory provisions governing the reporting of\nnon-compliance or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate authority; and\n\n(b)\n\nRequirements under auditing standards, including those relating to:\n•\n\nIdentifying and responding to non-compliance, including fraud.\n\n•\n\nCommunicating with those charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nConsidering the implications of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance\nfor the auditor’s report.\n\nSome laws and regulations might stipulate a period within which reports of non-compliance or\nsuspected non-compliance are to be made to an appropriate authority.\n\nCommunication with Respect to Groups\nR360.16\n\nWhere a professional accountant becomes aware of non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in either of the following two situations in the context of a group, the accountant shall\ncommunicate the matter to the group engagement partner unless prohibited from doing so by law\nor regulation:\n(a)\n\nThe accountant performs audit work related to a component for purposes of the group\naudit; or\n\n(b)\n\nThe accountant is engaged to perform an audit of the financial statements of a legal entity\nor business unit that is part of a group for purposes other than the group audit, for example,\na statutory audit.\n\nThe communication to the group engagement partner shall be in addition to responding to the\nmatter in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n360.16 A1\n\nThe purpose of the communication is to enable the group engagement partner to be informed\nabout the matter and to determine, in the context of the group audit, whether and, if so, how to\naddress it in accordance with the provisions in this section. The communication requirement in\nparagraph R360.16 applies regardless of whether the group engagement partner’s firm or network\nis the same as or different from the professional accountant’s firm or network.\n\nR360.17\n\nWhere the group engagement partner becomes aware of non-compliance or suspected noncompliance in the course of a group audit, the group engagement partner shall consider whether\nthe matter might be relevant to:\n(a)\n\nOne or more components subject to audit work for purposes of the group audit; or\n\n(b)\n\nOne or more legal entities or business units that are part of the group and whose financial\nstatements are subject to audit for purposes other than the group audit, for example, a\nstatutory audit.\n\nThis consideration shall be in addition to responding to the matter in the context of the group\naudit in accordance with the provisions of this section.\nR360.18\n\nIf the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance might be relevant to one or more of the\ncomponents specified in paragraph R360.17(a) and legal entities or business units specified in\nparagraph R360.17(b), the group engagement partner shall take steps to have the matter\ncommunicated to those performing audit work at the components, legal entities or business units,\nunless prohibited from doing so by law or regulation. If necessary, the group engagement partner\nshall arrange for appropriate inquiries to be made (either of management or from publicly\navailable information) as to whether the relevant legal entities or business units specified in\nparagraph R360.17(b) are subject to audit and, if so, to ascertain to the extent practicable the\nidentity of the auditors.\n\n360.18 A1\n\nThe purpose of the communication is to enable those responsible for audit work at the\ncomponents, legal entities or business units to be informed about the matter and to determine\nwhether and, if so, how to address it in accordance with the provisions in this section. The\nSECTION 360 Page 92 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\ncommunication requirement applies regardless of whether the group engagement partner’s firm\nor network is the same as or different from the firms or networks of those performing audit work\nat the components, legal entities or business units.\nDetermining Whether Further Action Is Needed\nR360.19\n\nThe professional accountant shall assess the appropriateness of the response of management\nand, where applicable, those charged with governance.\n\n360.19 A1\n\nRelevant factors to consider in assessing the appropriateness of the response of management\nand, where applicable, those charged with governance include whether:\n•\n\nThe response is timely.\n\n•\n\nThe non-compliance or suspected non-compliance has been adequately investigated.\n\n•\n\nAction has been, or is being, taken to rectify, remediate or mitigate the consequences of\nany non-compliance.\n\n•\n\nAction has been, or is being, taken to deter the commission of any non-compliance where\nit has not yet occurred.\n\n•\n\nAppropriate steps have been, or are being, taken to reduce the risk of re-occurrence, for\nexample, additional controls or training.\n\n•\n\nThe non-compliance or suspected non-compliance has been disclosed to an appropriate\nauthority where appropriate and, if so, whether the disclosure appears adequate.\n\nR360.20\n\nIn light of the response of management and, where applicable, those charged with governance,\nthe professional accountant shall determine if further action is needed in the public interest.\n\n360.20 A1\n\nThe determination of whether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend\non various factors, including:\n\n360.20 A2\n\n•\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework.\n\n•\n\nThe urgency of the situation.\n\n•\n\nThe pervasiveness of the matter throughout the client.\n\n•\n\nWhether the professional accountant continues to have confidence in the integrity of\nmanagement and, where applicable, those charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nWhether the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance is likely to recur.\n\n•\n\nWhether there is credible evidence of actual or potential substantial harm to the interests\nof the entity, investors, creditors, employees or the general public.\n\nExamples of circumstances that might cause the professional accountant no longer to have\nconfidence in the integrity of management and, where applicable, those charged with governance\ninclude situations where:\n•\n\nThe accountant suspects or has evidence of their involvement or intended involvement in\nany non-compliance.\n\n•\n\nThe accountant is aware that they have knowledge of such non-compliance and, contrary\nto legal or regulatory requirements, have not reported, or authorised the reporting of, the\nmatter to an appropriate authority within a reasonable period.\n\nR360.21\n\nThe professional accountant shall exercise professional judgement in determining the need for,\nand nature and extent of, further action. In making this determination, the accountant shall take\ninto account whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that the\naccountant has acted appropriately in the public interest.\n\n360.21 A1\n\nFurther action that the professional accountant might take includes:\n\n360.21 A2\n\n•\n\nDisclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory\nrequirement to do so.\n\n•\n\nWithdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship where permitted by\nlaw or regulation.\n\nWithdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship is not a substitute for taking\nother actions that might be needed to achieve the professional accountant’s objectives under this\nSECTION 360 Page 93 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nsection. In some jurisdictions, however, there might be limitations as to the further actions\navailable to the accountant. In such circumstances, withdrawal might be the only available course\nof action.\nR360.22\n\nWhere the professional accountant has withdrawn from the professional relationship pursuant to\nparagraphs R360.20 and 360.21 A1, the accountant shall, on request by the proposed\naccountant pursuant to paragraph R320.8, provide all relevant facts and other information\nconcerning the identified or suspected non-compliance to the proposed accountant. The\npredecessor accountant shall do so, even in the circumstances addressed in paragraph\nR320.8(b) where the client fails or refuses to grant the predecessor accountant permission to\ndiscuss the client’s affairs with the proposed accountant, unless prohibited by law or regulation.\n\n360.22 A1\n\nThe facts and other information to be provided are those that, in the predecessor accountant’s\nopinion, the proposed accountant needs to be aware of before deciding whether to accept the\naudit appointment. Section 320 addresses communications from proposed accountants.\n\nR360.23\n\nIf the proposed accountant is unable to communicate with the predecessor accountant, the\nproposed accountant shall take reasonable steps to obtain information about the circumstances\nof the change of appointment by other means.\n\n360.23 A1\n\nOther means to obtain information about the circumstances of the change of appointment include\ninquiries of third parties or background investigations of management or those charged with\ngovernance.\n\n360.24 A1\n\nAs assessment of the matter might involve complex analysis and judgements, the professional\naccountant might consider:\n•\n\nConsulting internally.\n\n•\n\nObtaining legal advice to understand the accountant’s options and the professional or legal\nimplications of taking any particular course of action.\n\n•\n\nConsulting on a confidential basis with a regulatory or professional body.\n\nDetermining Whether to Disclose the Matter to an Appropriate Authority\n360.25 A1\n\nDisclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority would be precluded if doing so would be\ncontrary to law or regulation. Otherwise, the purpose of making disclosure is to enable an\nappropriate authority to cause the matter to be investigated and action to be taken in the public\ninterest.\n\n360.25 A2\n\nThe determination of whether to make such a disclosure depends in particular on the nature and\nextent of the actual or potential harm that is or might be caused by the matter to investors,\ncreditors, employees or the general public. For example, the professional accountant might\ndetermine that disclosure of the matter to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of\naction if:\n\n360.25 A3\n\n•\n\nThe entity is engaged in bribery (for example, of local or foreign government officials for\npurposes of securing large contracts).\n\n•\n\nThe entity is regulated and the matter is of such significance as to threaten its license to\noperate.\n\n•\n\nThe entity is listed on a securities exchange and the matter might result in adverse\nconsequences to the fair and orderly market in the entity’s securities or pose a systemic\nrisk to the financial markets.\n\n•\n\nIt is likely that the entity would sell products that are harmful to public health or safety.\n\n•\n\nThe entity is promoting a scheme to its clients to assist them in evading taxes.\n\nThe determination of whether to make such a disclosure will also depend on external factors\nsuch as:\n•\n\nWhether there is an appropriate authority that is able to receive the information, and cause\nthe matter to be investigated and action to be taken. The appropriate authority will depend\non the nature of the matter. For example, the appropriate authority would be a securities\nregulator in the case of fraudulent financial reporting or an environmental protection\nagency in the case of a breach of environmental laws and regulations.\n\nSECTION 360 Page 94 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR360.26\n\n•\n\nWhether there exists robust and credible protection from civil, criminal or professional\nliability or retaliation afforded by legislation or regulation, such as under whistle-blowing\nlegislation or regulation.\n\n•\n\nWhether there are actual or potential threats to the physical safety of the professional\naccountant or other individuals.\n\nIf the professional accountant determines that disclosure of the non-compliance or suspected\nnon-compliance to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action in the\ncircumstances, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When\nmaking such disclosure, the accountant shall act in good faith and exercise caution when making\nstatements and assertions. The accountant shall also consider whether it is appropriate to inform\nthe client of the accountant’s intentions before disclosing the matter.\n\nImminent Breach\nR360.27\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant might become aware of actual or\nintended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent breach\nof a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors, employees or the\ngeneral public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to discuss the matter with\nmanagement or those charged with governance of the entity, the accountant shall exercise\nprofessional judgement and determine whether to disclose the matter immediately to an\nappropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such imminent breach.\nIf disclosure is made, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code.\n\nDocumentation\nR360.28\n\n360.28 A1\n\nIn relation to non-compliance or suspected non-compliance that falls within the scope of this\nsection, the professional accountant shall document:\n•\n\nHow management and, where applicable, those charged with governance have responded\nto the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe courses of action the accountant considered, the judgements made and the decisions\nthat were taken, having regard to the reasonable and informed third party test.\n\n•\n\nHow the accountant is satisfied that the accountant has fulfilled the responsibility set out\nin paragraph R360.20.\n\nThis documentation is in addition to complying with the documentation requirements under\napplicable auditing standards. ISAs, for example, require a professional accountant performing\nan audit of financial statements to:\n•\n\nPrepare documentation sufficient to enable an understanding of significant matters arising\nduring the audit, the conclusions reached, and significant professional judgements made\nin reaching those conclusions;\n\n•\n\nDocument discussions of significant matters with management, those charged with\ngovernance, and others, including the nature of the significant matters discussed and when\nand with whom the discussions took place; and\n\n•\n\nDocument identified or suspected non-compliance, and the results of discussion with\nmanagement and, where applicable, those charged with governance and other parties\noutside the entity.\n\nProfessional Services Other than Audits of Financial Statements\nObtaining an Understanding of the Matter and Addressing It with Management and Those Charged with\nGovernance\nR360.29\n\nIf a professional accountant engaged to provide a professional service other than an audit of\nfinancial statements becomes aware of information concerning non-compliance or suspected\nnon-compliance, the accountant shall seek to obtain an understanding of the matter. This\nunderstanding shall include the nature of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance and\nthe circumstances in which it has occurred or might be about to occur.\n\n360.29 A1\n\nThe professional accountant is expected to apply knowledge and expertise, and exercise\nprofessional judgement. However, the accountant is not expected to have a level of\nunderstanding of laws and regulations beyond that which is required for the professional service\nSECTION 360 Page 95 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nfor which the accountant was engaged. Whether an act constitutes actual non-compliance is\nultimately a matter to be determined by a court or other appropriate adjudicative body.\n360.29 A2\n\nDepending on the nature and significance of the matter, the professional accountant might\nconsult on a confidential basis with others within the firm, a network firm or a professional body,\nor with legal counsel.\n\nR360.30\n\nIf the professional accountant identifies or suspects that non-compliance has occurred or might\noccur, the accountant shall discuss the matter with the appropriate level of management. If the\naccountant has access to those charged with governance, the accountant shall also discuss the\nmatter with them where appropriate.\n\n360.30 A1\n\nThe purpose of the discussion is to clarify the professional accountant’s understanding of the\nfacts and circumstances relevant to the matter and its potential consequences. The discussion\nalso might prompt management or those charged with governance to investigate the matter.\n\n360.30 A2\n\nThe appropriate level of management with whom to discuss the matter is a question of\nprofessional judgement. Relevant factors to consider include:\n•\n\nThe nature and circumstances of the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe individuals actually or potentially involved.\n\n•\n\nThe likelihood of collusion.\n\n•\n\nThe potential consequences of the matter.\n\n•\n\nWhether that level of management is able to investigate the matter and take appropriate\naction.\n\nCommunicating the Matter to the Entity’s External Auditor\nR360.31\n\nIf the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for:\n(a)\n\nAn audit client of the firm; or\n\n(b)\n\nA component of an audit client of the firm,\n\nthe accountant shall communicate the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance within the\nfirm, unless prohibited from doing so by law or regulation. The communication shall be made in\naccordance with the firm’s protocols or procedures. In the absence of such protocols and\nprocedures, it shall be made directly to the audit engagement partner.\nR360.32\n\nIf the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for:\n(a)\n\nAn audit client of a network firm; or\n\n(b)\n\nA component of an audit client of a network firm,\n\nthe accountant shall consider whether to communicate the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance to the network firm. Where the communication is made, it shall be made in\naccordance with the network’s protocols or procedures. In the absence of such protocols and\nprocedures, it shall be made directly to the audit engagement partner.\nR360.33\n\nIf the professional accountant is performing a non-audit service for a client that is not:\n(a)\n\nAn audit client of the firm or a network firm; or\n\n(b)\n\nA component of an audit client of the firm or a network firm,\n\nthe accountant shall consider whether to communicate the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance to the firm that is the client’s external auditor, if any.\nRelevant Factors to Consider\n360.34 A1\n\nFactors relevant to considering the communication in accordance with paragraphs R360.31 to\nR360.33 include:\n•\n\nWhether doing so would be contrary to law or regulation.\n\n•\n\nWhether there are restrictions about disclosure imposed by a regulatory agency or\nprosecutor in an ongoing investigation into the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance.\nSECTION 360 Page 96 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nWhether the purpose of the engagement is to investigate potential non-compliance within\nthe entity to enable it to take appropriate action.\n\n•\n\nWhether management or those charged with governance have already informed the\nentity’s external auditor about the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe likely materiality of the matter to the audit of the client’s financial statements or, where\nthe matter relates to a component of a group, its likely materiality to the audit of the group\nfinancial statements.\n\nPurpose of Communication\n360.35 A1\n\nIn the circumstances addressed in paragraphs R360.31 to R360.33, the purpose of the\ncommunication is to enable the audit engagement partner to be informed about the noncompliance or suspected non-compliance and to determine whether and, if so, how to address\nit in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\nConsidering Whether Further Action Is Needed\nR360.36\n\nThe professional accountant shall also consider whether further action is needed in the public\ninterest.\n\n360.36 A1\n\nWhether further action is needed, and the nature and extent of it, will depend on factors such as:\n\n360.36 A2\n\n360.36 A3\n\nR360.37\n\n•\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework.\n\n•\n\nThe appropriateness and timeliness of the response of management and, where\napplicable, those charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nThe urgency of the situation.\n\n•\n\nThe involvement of management or those charged with governance in the matter.\n\n•\n\nThe likelihood of substantial harm to the interests of the client, investors, creditors,\nemployees or the general public.\n\nFurther action by the professional accountant might include:\n•\n\nDisclosing the matter to an appropriate authority even when there is no legal or regulatory\nrequirement to do so.\n\n•\n\nWithdrawing from the engagement and the professional relationship where permitted by\nlaw or regulation.\n\nIn considering whether to disclose to an appropriate authority, relevant factors to take into\naccount include:\n•\n\nWhether doing so would be contrary to law or regulation.\n\n•\n\nWhether there are restrictions about disclosure imposed by a regulatory agency or\nprosecutor in an ongoing investigation into the non-compliance or suspected noncompliance.\n\n•\n\nWhether the purpose of the engagement is to investigate potential non-compliance within\nthe entity to enable it to take appropriate action.\n\nIf the professional accountant determines that disclosure of the non-compliance or suspected\nnon-compliance to an appropriate authority is an appropriate course of action in the\ncircumstances, that disclosure is permitted pursuant to paragraph R114.3 of the Code. When\nmaking such disclosure, the accountant shall act in good faith and exercise caution when making\nstatements and assertions. The accountant shall also consider whether it is appropriate to inform\nthe client of the accountant’s intentions before disclosing the matter.\n\nImminent Breach\nR360.38\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the professional accountant might become aware of actual or\nintended conduct that the accountant has reason to believe would constitute an imminent breach\nof a law or regulation that would cause substantial harm to investors, creditors, employees or the\ngeneral public. Having first considered whether it would be appropriate to discuss the matter with\nmanagement or those charged with governance of the entity, the accountant shall exercise\nprofessional judgement and determine whether to disclose the matter immediately to an\nappropriate authority in order to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such imminent breach\nSECTION 360 Page 97 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nof law or regulation.

For other audit and assurance engagements Part 4A or 4B of this Code\nmay apply.\n\n400.0 A1\n\nIn accordance with UK legislation, ICAEW has adopted, as regards auditor independence\nrequirements for UK audits, the FRC ES. The FRC has stated, in its Scope and Authority\nof Audit and Assurance Pronouncements, that the FRC ES was developed with the intent\nthat it should adhere to the principles of the IESBA Code. ICAEW accordingly does not\nrequire Part 4A of this Code to be applied if the FRC ES is followed.\n\n400.0 A2\n\nThe independence requirements to be adopted for different types of assurance\nengagement, are set out below:\n\n400.0A3\n\nType of assurance engagement\n\nIndependence requirements to be\nfollowed\n\nAudit Engagements in\naccordance with ISAs (UK)\n\nThe FRC ES\n\nAudit Engagements performed\nin accordance with other\nstandards\n\nPart 4A of this Code or if more\nconvenient to apply, the\nindependence requirements of\nthe FRC\n\nReview engagements\n\nPart 4A of this Code or if more\nconvenient to apply, the\nindependence requirements of\nthe FRC\n\nPublic Interest Assurance\nEngagement\n\nThe independence\nrequirements of the FRC\n\nOther types of Assurance\nEngagements\n\nPart 4B of this Code.\n\nProfessional accountants should note that the Statements of Investment Circular Reporting\nStandards (SIRS), issued by the FRC require compliance with relevant parts of the FRC\nES. Accordingly, any professional accountant in public practice issuing a report that states\nthat the work has been carried out in accordance with the SIRS will need to comply with\nthe independence requirements of the FRC ES.\n\nGeneral\n400.1\n\nIt is in the public interest and required by the Code that professional accountants in public practice\nbe independent when performing audit or review engagements.\n\nSECTION 400 Page 101 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n400.2\n\nThis Part applies to both audit and review engagements unless otherwise stated. The terms\n“audit,” “audit team,” “audit engagement,” “audit client,” and “audit report” apply equally to review,\nreview team, review engagement, review client, and review engagement report.\n\n400.3\n\nIn this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in\npublic practice and their firms.\n\n400.4\n\nISQM 1 requires a firm to design implement and operate a system of quality management for\naudits or reviews of financial statements performed by the firm. As part of this system of quality\nmanagement, ISQM 1 requires the firm to establish quality objectives that address the fulfilment\nof responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements, including those related to\nindependence. Under ISQM 1, relevant ethical requirements are those related to the firm, its\npersonnel and, when applicable, others subject to the independence requirements to which the\nfirm and the firm’s engagements are subject. ISAs and ISREs establish responsibilities for\nengagement partners and engagement teams at the level of the engagement for audits and\nreviews, respectively. The allocation of responsibilities within a firm will depend on its size,\nstructure and organisation. Many of the provisions of this Part do not prescribe the specific\nresponsibility of individuals within the firm for actions related to independence, instead referring\nto “firm” for ease of reference. A firm assigns operational responsibility for compliance with\nindependence requirements to an individual(s) in accordance with ISQM 1. In addition, an\nindividual professional accountant remains responsible for compliance with any provisions that\napply to that accountant’s activities, interests or relationships.\n\n400.5\n\nIndependence is linked to the principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:\n(a)\n\nIndependence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion\nwithout being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby\nallowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional\nscepticism.\n\n(b)\n\nIndependence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so\nsignificant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a\nfirm’s, or an audit team member’s, integrity, objectivity or professional scepticism has been\ncompromised.\n\nIn this Part, references to an individual or firm being “independent” mean that the individual or firm\nhas complied with the provisions of this Part.\n400.6\n\nWhen performing audit engagements, the Code requires firms to comply with the fundamental\nprinciples and be independent. This Part sets out specific requirements and application material\non how to apply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when performing such\nengagements. The conceptual framework set out in Section 120 applies to independence as it\ndoes to the fundamental principles set out in Section 110. Section 405 sets out specific\nrequirements and application material applicable in a group audit.\n\n400.7\n\nThis Part describes:\n(a)\n\nFacts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that\ncreate or might create threats to independence;\n\n(b)\n\nPotential actions, including safeguards, that might be appropriate to address any such\nthreats; and\n\n(c)\n\nSome situations where the threats cannot be eliminated or there can be no safeguards to\nreduce them to an acceptable level.\n\nEngagement Team and Audit Team\n400.8\n\nThis Part applies to all audit team members, including engagement team members.\n\n400.9\n\nAn engagement team for an audit engagement includes all partners and staff in the firm who\nperform audit work on the engagement, and any other individuals who perform audit procedures\nwho are from:\n(a)\n\nA network firm; or\n\n(b)\n\nA firm that is not a network firm, or another service provider.\n\nFor example, an individual from a component auditor firm who performs audit procedures on the\nSECTION 400 Page 102 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nfinancial information of a component for purposes of a group audit is a member of the\nengagement team for the group audit.\n400.10\n\nIn ISQM 1, a service provider includes an individual or organisation external to the firm that\nprovides a resource that is used in the performance of engagements. Service providers exclude\nthe firm, a network firm or other structures or organisations in the network.\n\n400.11\n\nAn audit engagement might involve experts within, or engaged by, the firm, a network firm, or a\ncomponent auditor firm outside a group auditor firm’s network, who assist in the engagement.\nDepending on the role of the individuals, they might be engagement team or audit team members.\nFor example:\n•\n\nIndividuals with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or auditing who perform audit\nprocedures are engagement team members. These include, for example, individuals with\nexpertise in accounting for income taxes or in analysing complex information produced by\nautomated tools and techniques for the purpose of identifying unusual or unexpected\nrelationships.\n\n•\n\nIndividuals within, or engaged by, the firm who have direct influence over the outcome of\nthe audit engagement through consultation regarding technical or industry-specific issues,\ntransactions or events for the engagement are audit team members but not engagement\nteam members.\n\nHowever, individuals who are external experts are neither engagement team nor audit team\nmembers.\n400.12\n\nIf the audit engagement is subject to an engagement quality review, the engagement quality\nreviewer and any other individuals performing the engagement quality review are audit team\nmembers but not engagement team members.\n\nPublic Interest Entities\n400.13\n\nSome of the requirements and application material set out in this Part are applicable only to the\naudit of financial statements of public interest entities, reflecting significant public interest in the\nfinancial condition of these entities due to the potential impact of their financial well-being on\nstakeholders.\n\n400.14\n\nFactors to consider in evaluating the extent of public interest in the financial condition of an entity\ninclude:\n\n400.15\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the business or activities, such as taking on financial obligations to the public\nas part of the entity’s primary business.\n\n•\n\nWhether the entity is subject to regulatory supervision designed to provide confidence that\nthe entity will meet its financial obligations.\n\n•\n\nSize of the entity.\n\n•\n\nThe importance of the entity to the sector in which it operates including how easily\nreplaceable it is in the event of financial failure.\n\n•\n\nNumber and nature of stakeholders including investors, customers, creditors and\nemployees.\n\n•\n\nThe potential systemic impact on other sectors and the economy as a whole in the event\nof financial failure of the entity.\n\nStakeholders have heightened expectations regarding the independence of a firm performing an\naudit engagement for a public interest entity because of the significance of the public interest in\nthe financial condition of the entity. The purpose of the requirements and application material for\npublic interest entities as described in paragraph 400.13 is to meet these expectations, thereby\nenhancing stakeholders’ confidence in the entity’s financial statements that can be used when\nassessing the entity’s financial condition.\n\nReports that Include a Restriction on Use and Distribution\n400.16\n\nAn audit report might include a restriction on use and distribution. If it does and the conditions set\nout in Section 800 are met, then the independence requirements in this Part may be modified as\nprovided in Section 800.\n\nSECTION 400 Page 103 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nAssurance Engagements other than Audit and Review Engagements\n400.17\n\nIndependence standards for assurance engagements that are not audit or review engagements\nare set out in Part 4B – Independence for Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review\nEngagements.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR400.18\n\nA firm performing an audit engagement shall be independent.\n\nR400.19\n\nA firm shall apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and\naddress threats to independence in relation to an audit engagement.\n\nProhibition on Assuming Management Responsibilities\nR400.20\n\nA firm or a network firm shall not assume a management responsibility for an audit client.\n\n400.20 A1\n\nManagement responsibilities involve controlling, leading and directing an entity, including making\ndecisions regarding the acquisition, deployment and control of human, financial, technological,\nphysical and intangible resources.\n\n400.20 A2\n\nWhen a firm or a network firm assumes a management responsibility for an audit client, selfreview, self-interest and familiarity threats are created. Assuming a management responsibility\nmight also create an advocacy threat because the firm or network firm becomes too closely\naligned with the views and interests of management.\n\n400.20 A3\n\nDetermining whether an activity is a management responsibility depends on the circumstances\nand requires the exercise of professional judgement. Examples of activities that would be\nconsidered a management responsibility include:\n•\n\nSetting policies and strategic direction.\n\n•\n\nHiring or dismissing employees.\n\n•\n\nDirecting and taking responsibility for the actions of employees in relation to the\nemployees’ work for the entity.\n\n•\n\nAuthorising transactions.\n\n•\n\nControlling or managing bank accounts or investments.\n\n•\n\nDeciding which recommendations of the firm or network firm or other third parties to\nimplement.\n\n•\n\nReporting to those charged with governance on behalf of management.\n\n•\n\nTaking responsibility for:\no\n\nThe preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with\nthe applicable financial reporting framework.\n\no\n\nDesigning, implementing, monitoring or maintaining internal control.\n\n400.20 A4\n\nSubject to compliance with paragraph R400.21, providing advice and recommendations to assist\nthe management of an audit client in discharging its responsibilities is not assuming a\nmanagement responsibility. The provision of advice and recommendations to an audit client\nmight create a self-review threat and is addressed in Section 600.\n\nR400.21\n\nWhen performing a professional activity for an audit client, the firm shall be satisfied that client\nmanagement makes all judgements and decisions that are the proper responsibility of\nmanagement. This includes ensuring that the client’s management:\n(a)\n\nDesignates an individual who possesses suitable skill, knowledge and experience to be\nresponsible at all times for the client’s decisions and to oversee the activities. Such an\nindividual, preferably within senior management, would understand:\n(i)\n\nThe objectives, nature and results of the activities; and\n\n(ii)\n\nThe respective client and firm or network firm responsibilities.\n\nSECTION 400 Page 104 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nHowever, the individual is not required to possess the expertise to perform or re-perform\nthe activities.\n(b)\n\nProvides oversight of the activities and evaluates the adequacy of the results of the\nactivities performed for the client’s purpose.\n\n(c)\n\nAccepts responsibility for the actions, if any, to be taken arising from the results of the\nactivities.\n\n400.21 A1 When technology is used in performing a professional activity for an audit client, the requirements\nin paragraphs R400.20 and R400.21 apply regardless of the nature or extent of such use of the\ntechnology.\nPublic Interest Entities\nR400.22\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, a firm shall treat an entity as a public interest entity when it falls\nwithin any of the following categories:\n(a)\n\nA publicly traded entity;\n\n(b)\n\nAn entity one of whose main functions is to take deposits from the public;\n\n(c)\n\nAn entity one of whose main functions is to provide insurance to the public; or\n\n(d)\n\nAn entity specified as such by law, regulation or professional standards to meet the\npurpose described in paragraph 400.15.\n\n400.22 A1\n\nWhen terms other than public interest entity are applied to entities by law, regulation or\nprofessional standards to meet the purpose described in paragraph 400.15, such terms are\nregarded as equivalent terms. However, if law, regulation or professional standards designate\nentities as “public interest entities” for reasons unrelated to the purpose described in paragraph\n400.15, that designation does not necessarily mean that such entities are public interest entities\nfor the purposes of the Code.\n\nR400.23\n\nIn complying with the requirement in paragraph R400.22, a firm shall take into account more\nexplicit definitions established by law, regulation or professional standards for the categories set\nout in paragraph R400.22 (a) to (c).\n\n400.23 A1\n\nThe categories set out in paragraph R400.22 (a) to (c) are broadly defined and no recognition is\ngiven to any size or other factors that can be relevant in a specific jurisdiction. The Code therefore\nprovides for those bodies responsible for setting ethics standards for professional accountants to\nmore explicitly define these categories by, for example:\n\n400.23 A2\n\n•\n\nMaking reference to specific public markets for trading securities.\n\n•\n\nMaking reference to the local law or regulation defining banks or insurance companies.\n\n•\n\nIncorporating exemptions for specific types of entities, such as an entity with mutual\nownership.\n\n•\n\nSetting size criteria for certain types of entities.\n\nParagraph R400.22 (d) anticipates that those bodies responsible for setting ethics standards for\nprofessional accountants will add categories of public interest entities to meet the purpose\ndescribed in paragraph 400.15, taking into account factors such as those set out in paragraph\n400.14. Depending on the facts and circumstances in a specific jurisdiction, such categories could\ninclude:\n•\n\nPension funds.\n\n•\n\nCollective investment vehicles.\n\n•\n\nPrivate entities with large numbers of stakeholders (other than investors).\n\n•\n\nNot-for-profit organisations or governmental entities.\n\nSECTION 400 Page 105 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n400.24 A1\n\nPublic utilities.\n\nA firm is encouraged to determine whether to treat other entities as public interest entities for the\npurposes of this Part. When making this determination, the firm might consider the factors set out\nin paragraph 400.14 as well as the following factors:\n•\n\nWhether the entity is likely to become a public interest entity in the near future.\n\n•\n\nWhether in similar circumstances, a predecessor firm has applied independence\nrequirements for public interest entities to the entity.\n\n•\n\nWhether in similar circumstances, the firm has applied independence requirements for\npublic interest entities to other entities.\n\n•\n\nWhether the entity has been specified as not being a public interest entity by law, regulation\nor professional standards.\n\n•\n\nWhether the entity or other stakeholders requested the firm to apply independence\nrequirements for public interest entities to the entity and, if so, whether there are any\nreasons for not meeting this request.\n\n•\n\nThe entity’s corporate governance arrangements, for example, whether those charged with\ngovernance are distinct from the owners or management.\n\nPublic Disclosure – Application of Independence Requirements for Public Interest Entities\nR400.25\n\nSubject to paragraph R400.26, when a firm has applied the independence requirements for public\ninterest entities as described in paragraph 400.13 in performing an audit of the financial\nstatements of an entity, the firm shall publicly disclose that fact in a manner deemed appropriate,\ntaking into account the timing and accessibility of the information to stakeholders.\n\nR400.26\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R400.25, a firm may not make such a disclosure if doing so will\nresult in disclosing confidential future plans of the entity.\n\nRelated Entities\nR400.27\n\nAs defined, an audit client that is a publicly traded entity in accordance with paragraphs R400.22\nand R400.23 includes all of its related entities. For all other entities, references to an audit client\nin this Part include related entities over which the client has direct or indirect control.

Whether these larger structures create a network depends on the\nparticular facts and circumstances. It does not depend on whether the firms and entities are\nlegally separate and distinct.\n\nR400.51\n\nA network firm shall be independent of the audit clients of the other firms within the network as\nrequired by this Part.\n\n400.51 A1\n\nThe independence requirements in this Part that apply to a network firm apply to any entity that\nmeets the definition of a network firm. It is not necessary for the entity also to meet the definition\nof a firm. For example, a consulting practice or professional law practice might be a network firm\nbut not a firm.\n\nR400.52\n\nWhen associated with a larger structure of other firms and entities, a firm shall:\n\nR400.53\n\n(a)\n\nExercise professional judgement to determine whether a network is created by such a\nlarger structure;\n\n(b)\n\nConsider whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that\nthe other firms and entities in the larger structure are associated in such a way that a\nnetwork exists; and\n\n(c)\n\nApply such judgement consistently throughout such a larger structure.\n\nWhen determining whether a network is created by a larger structure of firms and other entities,\na firm shall conclude that a network exists when such a larger structure is aimed at co-operation\nand:\n(a)\n\nIt is clearly aimed at profit or cost sharing among the entities within the structure. (Ref:\nPara. 400.53 A2);\n\n(b)\n\nThe entities within the structure share common ownership, control or management. (Ref:\nPara. 400.53 A3);\n\n(c)\n\nThe entities within the structure share common quality management policies and\nprocedures. (Ref: Para. 400.53 A4);\n\n(d)\n\nThe entities within the structure share a common business strategy. (Ref: Para. 400.53\nA5);\n\n(e)\n\nThe entities within the structure share the use of a common brand name. (Ref: Para.\n400.53 A6, 400.53 A7); or\n\n(f)\n\nThe entities within the structure share a significant part of professional resources. (Ref:\nPara 400.53 A8, 400.53 A9).\n\n400.53 A1\n\nThere might be other arrangements between firms and entities within a larger structure that\nconstitute a network, in addition to those arrangements described in paragraph R400.53.\nHowever, a larger structure might be aimed only at facilitating the referral of work, which in itself\ndoes not meet the criteria necessary to constitute a network.\n\n400.53 A2\n\nThe sharing of immaterial costs does not in itself create a network. In addition, if the sharing of\ncosts is limited only to those costs related to the development of audit methodologies, manuals\nor training courses, this would not in itself create a network. Further, an association between a\nfirm and an otherwise unrelated entity jointly to provide a service or develop a product does not\nin itself create a network. (Ref: Para. R400.53(a)).\nSECTION 400 Page 108 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n400.53 A3\n\nCommon ownership, control or management might be achieved by contract or other means. (Ref:\nPara. R400.53(b)).\n\n400.53 A4\n\nCommon quality management policies and procedures are those designed, implemented and\noperated across the larger structure. (Ref: Para. R400.53(c)).\n\n400.53 A5\n\nSharing a common business strategy involves an agreement by the entities to achieve common\nstrategic objectives. An entity is not a network firm merely because it co-operates with another\nentity solely to respond jointly to a request for a proposal for the provision of a professional\nservice. (Ref: Para. R400.53(d)).\n\n400.53 A6\n\nA common brand name includes common initials or a common name. A firm is using a common\nbrand name if it includes, for example, the common brand name as part of, or along with, its firm\nname when a partner of the firm signs an audit report. (Ref: Para. R400.53(e)).\n\n400.53 A7\n\nEven if a firm does not belong to a network and does not use a common brand name as part of\nits firm name, it might appear to belong to a network if its stationery or promotional materials refer\nto the firm being a member of an association of firms. Accordingly, if care is not taken in how a\nfirm describes such membership, a perception might be created that the firm belongs to a\nnetwork. (Ref: Para. R400.53(e)).\n\n400.53 A8\n\nProfessional resources include:\n\n400.53 A9\n\n•\n\nCommon systems that enable firms to exchange information such as client data, billing\nand time records.\n\n•\n\nPartners and other personnel.\n\n•\n\nTechnical departments that consult on technical or industry-specific issues, transactions\nor events for assurance engagements.\n\n•\n\nAudit methodology or audit manuals.\n\n•\n\nTraining courses and facilities. (Ref: Para. R400.53(f)).\n\nWhether the shared professional resources are significant depends on the circumstances. For\nexample:\n•\n\nThe shared resources might be limited to common audit methodology or audit manuals,\nwith no exchange of personnel or client or market information. In such circumstances, it is\nunlikely that the shared resources would be significant. The same applies to a common\ntraining endeavour.\n\n•\n\nThe shared resources might involve the exchange of personnel or information, such as\nwhere personnel are drawn from a shared pool, or where a common technical department\nis created within the larger structure to provide participating firms with technical advice that\nthe firms are required to follow. In such circumstances, a reasonable and informed third\nparty is more likely to conclude that the shared resources are significant. (Ref: Para.\nR400.53(f)).\n\nR400.54\n\nIf a firm or a network sells a component of its practice, and the component continues to use all\nor part of the firm’s or network’s name for a limited time, the relevant entities shall determine how\nto disclose that they are not network firms when presenting themselves to outside parties.\n\n400.54 A1\n\nThe agreement for the sale of a component of a practice might provide that, for a limited period\nof time, the sold component can continue to use all or part of the name of the firm or the network,\neven though it is no longer connected to the firm or the network. In such circumstances, while\nthe two entities might be practicing under a common name, the facts are such that they do not\nbelong to a larger structure aimed at cooperation. The two entities are therefore not network\nfirms.\n\n[Paragraphs 400.55 to 400.59 are intentionally left blank]\nGeneral Documentation of Independence for Audit and Review Engagements\nR400.60\n\nA firm shall document conclusions regarding compliance with this Part, and the substance of any\nrelevant discussions that support those conclusions.

This might be because the\nfirm provides a non-assurance service to the related entity, which the entity is not able to\ntransition in an orderly manner to another provider by that date.\n\n400.72 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of a threat created by mergers and acquisitions\nwhen there are interests and relationships that cannot reasonably be ended include:\n\nR400.73\n\n400.73 A1\n\n•\n\nThe nature and significance of the interest or relationship.\n\n•\n\nThe nature and significance of the related entity relationship (for example, whether the\nrelated entity is a subsidiary or parent).\n\n•\n\nThe length of time until the interest or relationship can reasonably be ended.\n\nIf, following the discussion set out in paragraph R400.72(b), those charged with governance\nrequest the firm to continue as the auditor, the firm shall do so only if:\n(a)\n\nThe interest or relationship will be ended as soon as reasonably possible but no later than\nsix months after the effective date of the merger or acquisition;\n\n(b)\n\nAny individual who has such an interest or relationship, including one that has arisen\nthrough performing a non-assurance service that would not be permitted by Section 600\nand its subsections, will not be a member of the engagement team for the audit or the\nindividual responsible for the engagement quality review; and\n\n(c)\n\nTransitional measures will be applied, as necessary, and discussed with those charged\nwith governance.\n\nExamples of such transitional measures include:\n•\n\nHaving a professional accountant review the audit or non-assurance work as appropriate.\n\nSECTION 400 Page 110 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR400.74\n\n•\n\nHaving a professional accountant, who is not a member of the firm expressing the opinion\non the financial statements, perform a review that is consistent with the objective of an\nengagement quality review.\n\n•\n\nEngaging another firm to evaluate the results of the non-assurance service or having\nanother firm re-perform the non-assurance service to the extent necessary to enable the\nother firm to take responsibility for the service.\n\nThe firm might have completed a significant amount of work on the audit prior to the effective\ndate of the merger or acquisition and might be able to complete the remaining audit procedures\nwithin a short period of time. In such circumstances, if those charged with governance request\nthe firm to complete the audit while continuing with an interest or relationship identified in\nparagraph 400.70 A1, the firm shall only do so if it:\n(a)\n\nHas evaluated the level of the threat and discussed the results with those charged with\ngovernance;\n\n(b)\n\nComplies with the requirements of paragraph R400.73(b) to (c); and\n\n(c)\n\nCeases to be the auditor no later than the date that the audit report is issued.\n\nIf Objectivity Remains Compromised\nR400.75\n\nEven if all the requirements of paragraphs R400.71 to R400.74 could be met, the firm shall\ndetermine whether the circumstances identified in paragraph 400.70 A1 create a threat that\ncannot be addressed such that objectivity would be compromised.

This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to\napplying the conceptual framework when performing a group audit engagement.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n405.2 A1\n\nISAs apply to an audit of group financial statements. ISA 600 (Revised) deals with special\nconsiderations that apply to an audit of group financial statements, including when component\nauditors are involved. ISA 600 (Revised) requires the group engagement partner to take\nresponsibility for confirming whether the component auditors understand and will comply with the\nrelevant ethical requirements, including those related to independence, that apply to the group\naudit. The independence requirements referred to in ISA 600 (Revised), or other relevant auditing\nstandards applicable to group audits that are equivalent to ISA 600 (Revised), are those specified\nin this section.\n\n405.2 A2\n\nA component auditor firm that participates in a group audit engagement might separately issue\nan audit opinion on the financial statements of the component audit client. Depending on the\ncircumstances, the component auditor firm might need to comply with different independence\nrequirements when performing audit work for a group audit and separately issuing an audit\nopinion on the financial statements of the component audit client for statutory, regulatory or other\nreasons.\n\nCommunication Between a Group Auditor Firm and a Component Auditor Firm\nR405.3\n\nISA 600 (Revised) requires the group engagement partner to take responsibility to make a\ncomponent auditor aware of the relevant ethical requirements that are applicable given the nature\nand the circumstances of the group audit engagement.

This section sets out specific\nrequirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework to identify,\nevaluate and address threats to independence arising from fees charged to audit clients.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n410.3 A1\n\nFees for professional services are usually negotiated with and paid by an audit client and might\ncreate threats to independence. This practice is generally recognised and accepted by intended\nusers of financial statements.\n\n410.3 A2\n\nWhen the audit client is a public interest entity, stakeholders have heightened expectations\nregarding the firm’s independence. As transparency can serve to better inform the views and\ndecisions of those charged with governance and a wide range of stakeholders, this section\nprovides for disclosure of fee-related information to both those charged with governance and\nstakeholders more generally for audit clients that are public interest entities.\n\n410.3 A3\n\nFor the purposes of this section, audit fees comprise fees or other types of remuneration for an\naudit or review of financial statements. Where reference is made to the fee for the audit of the\nfinancial statements, this does not include any fee for an audit of special purpose financial\nstatements or a review of financial statements. (Ref: Para. R410.23(a), 410.25 A1 and\nR410.31(a))\n\nFees Paid by an Audit Client\n410.4 A1\n\nWhen fees are negotiated with and paid by an audit client, this creates a self-interest threat and\nmight create an intimidation threat to independence.\n\n410.4 A2\n\nThe application of the conceptual framework requires that before a firm or network firm accepts\nan audit or any other engagement for an audit client, the firm determines whether the threats to\nindependence created by the fees proposed to the client are at an acceptable level. The\napplication of the conceptual framework also requires the firm to re-evaluate such threats when\nfacts and circumstances change during the engagement period for the audit.\n\n410.4 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created when fees for an audit or any\nother engagement are paid by the audit client include:\n•\n\nThe level of the fees and the extent to which they have regard to the resources required,\ntaking into account the firm’s commercial and market priorities.\n\n•\n\nAny linkage between fees for the audit and those for services other than audit and the\nrelative size of both elements.\n\n•\n\nThe extent of any dependency between the level of the fee for, and the outcome of, the\nservice.\n\n•\n\nWhether the fee is for services to be provided by the firm or a network firm.\n\n•\n\nThe level of the fee in the context of the service to be provided by the firm or a network\nfirm.\n\n•\n\nThe operating structure and the compensation arrangements of the firm and network firms.\n\n•\n\nThe significance of the client, or a third party referring the client, to the firm, network firm,\npartner or office.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the client, for example whether the client is a public interest entity.\n\nSECTION 410 Page 120 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nThe relationship of the client to the related entities to which the services other than audit\nare provided, for example when the related entity is a sister entity.\n\n•\n\nThe involvement of those charged with governance in appointing the auditor and agreeing\nfees, and the apparent emphasis they and client management place on the quality of the\naudit and the overall level of the fees.\n\n•\n\nWhether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party, such as a regulatory body.\n\n•\n\nWhether the quality of the firm’s audit work is subject to the review of an independent third\nparty, such as an oversight body.\n\n410.4 A4\n\nThe conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraph 120.15 A3 (particularly a system\nof quality management designed, implemented and operated by the firm in accordance with\nquality management standards issued by the IAASB) might also impact the evaluation of whether\nthe threats to independence are at an acceptable level.\n\n410.4 A5\n\nThe requirements and application material that follow identify circumstances which might need\nto be further evaluated when determining whether the threats are at an acceptable level. For\nthose circumstances, application material includes examples of additional factors that might be\nrelevant in evaluating the threats.\n\nLevel of Audit Fees\n410.5 A1\n\nDetermining the fees to be charged to an audit client, whether for audit or other services, is a\nbusiness decision of the firm taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant to that\nspecific engagement, including the requirements of technical and professional standards.\n\n410.5 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of self-interest and intimidation threats created\nby the level of the audit fee paid by the audit client include:\n\n410.5 A3\n\n•\n\nThe firm’s commercial rationale for the audit fee.\n\n•\n\nWhether undue pressure has been, or is being, applied by the client to reduce the audit\nfee.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who does not take part in the audit engagement assess\nthe reasonableness of the fee proposed, having regard to the scope and complexity of the\nengagement.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the audit engagement review the\nwork performed.\n\nImpact of Other Services Provided to an Audit Client\nR410.6\n\nSubject to paragraph R410.7, a firm shall not allow the audit fee to be influenced by the provision\nof services other than audit to an audit client by the firm or a network firm.\n\n410.6 A1\n\nThe audit fee ordinarily reflects a combination of matters, such as those identified in paragraph\n410.23 A1. However, the provision of other services to an audit client is not an appropriate\nconsideration in determining the audit fee.\n\nR410.7\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R410.6, when determining the audit fee, the firm may take into\nconsideration the cost savings achieved as a result of experience derived from the provision of\nservices other than audit to an audit client.\n\nContingent Fees\n410.8 A1\n\nContingent fees are fees calculated on a predetermined basis relating to the outcome of a\ntransaction or the result of the services performed. A contingent fee charged through an\nintermediary is an example of an indirect contingent fee. In this section, a fee is not regarded as\nbeing contingent if established by a court or other public authority.\n\nR410.9\n\nA firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for an audit engagement.\n\nR410.10\n\nA firm or network firm shall not charge directly or indirectly a contingent fee for a non-assurance\nservice provided to an audit client, if:\n(a)\n\nThe fee is charged by the firm expressing the opinion on the financial statements and the\nfee is material or expected to be material to that firm;\n\nSECTION 410 Page 121 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(b)\n\nThe fee is charged by a network firm that participates in a significant part of the audit and\nthe fee is material or expected to be material to that firm; or\n\n(c)\n\nThe outcome of the non-assurance service, and therefore the amount of the fee, is\ndependent on a future or contemporary judgement related to the audit of a material amount\nin the financial statements.\n\n410.10 A1\n\nParagraphs R410.9 and R410.10 preclude a firm or a network firm from entering into certain\ncontingent fee arrangements with an audit client. Even if a contingent fee arrangement is not\nprecluded when providing a non-assurance service to an audit client, it might still impact the level\nof the self-interest threat.\n\n410.10 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:\n\n410.10 A3\n\n•\n\nThe range of possible fee amounts.\n\n•\n\nWhether an appropriate authority determines the outcome on which the contingent fee\ndepends.\n\n•\n\nDisclosure to intended users of the work performed by the firm and the basis of\nremuneration.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the service.\n\n•\n\nThe effect of the event or transaction on the financial statements.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in performing the non-assurance\nservice review the work performed.\n\n•\n\nObtaining an advance written agreement with the client on the basis of remuneration.\n\nTotal Fees – Proportion of Fees for Services Other than Audit to Audit Fee\n410.11 A1\n\nThe level of the self-interest threat might be impacted when a large proportion of fees charged\nby the firm or network firms to an audit client is generated by providing services other than audit\nto the client, due to concerns about the potential loss of either the audit engagement or other\nservices.

This section sets out requirements and application material\nrelevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nAll Audit Clients\n540.3 A1\n\nAlthough an understanding of an audit client and its environment is fundamental to audit quality,\na familiarity threat might be created as a result of an individual’s long association as an audit\nteam member with:\n(a)\n\nThe audit client and its operations;\n\n(b)\n\nThe audit client’s senior management; or\n\n(c)\n\nThe financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion or the financial\ninformation which forms the basis of the financial statements.\n\n540.3 A2\n\nA self-interest threat might be created as a result of an individual’s concern about losing a\nlongstanding client or an interest in maintaining a close personal relationship with a member of\nsenior management or those charged with governance. Such a threat might influence the\nindividual’s judgement inappropriately.\n\n540.3 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant to evaluating the level of such familiarity or self-interest threats include:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n540.3 A4\n\nIn relation to the individual:\n•\n\nThe overall length of the individual’s relationship with the client, including if such\nrelationship existed while the individual was at a prior firm.\n\n•\n\nHow long the individual has been an engagement team member, and the nature of\nthe roles performed.\n\n•\n\nThe extent to which the work of the individual is directed, reviewed and supervised\nby more senior personnel.\n\n•\n\nThe extent to which the individual, due to the individual’s seniority, has the ability to\ninfluence the outcome of the audit, for example, by making key decisions or directing\nthe work of other engagement team members.\n\n•\n\nThe closeness of the individual’s personal relationship with senior management or\nthose charged with governance.\n\n•\n\nThe nature, frequency and extent of the interaction between the individual and senior\nmanagement or those charged with governance.\n\nIn relation to the audit client:\n•\n\nThe nature or complexity of the client’s accounting and financial reporting issues and\nwhether they have changed.\n\n•\n\nWhether there have been any recent changes in senior management or those\ncharged with governance.\n\n•\n\nWhether there have been any structural changes in the client’s organisation which\nimpact the nature, frequency and extent of interactions the individual might have with\nsenior management or those charged with governance.\n\nThe combination of two or more factors might increase or reduce the level of the threats. For\nexample, familiarity threats created over time by the increasingly close relationship between an\nSECTION 540 Page 145 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nindividual and a member of the client’s senior management would be reduced by the departure\nof that member of the client’s senior management.\n540.3 A5\n\nAn example of an action that might eliminate the familiarity and self-interest threats created by\nan individual being involved in an audit engagement over a long period of time would be rotating\nthe individual off the audit team.\n\n540.3 A6\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such familiarity or self-interest threats\ninclude:\n\nR540.4\n\n•\n\nChanging the role of the individual on the audit team or the nature and extent of the tasks\nthe individual performs.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not an audit team member review the work of the\nindividual.\n\n•\n\nPerforming regular independent internal or external quality reviews of the engagement.\n\nIf a firm decides that the level of the threats created can only be addressed by rotating the\nindividual off the audit team, the firm shall determine an appropriate period during which the\nindividual shall not:\n(a)\n\nBe a member of the engagement team for the audit engagement;\n\n(b)\n\nPerform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the objective of an\nengagement quality review, for the engagement; or\n\n(c)\n\nExert direct influence on the outcome of the audit engagement.\n\nThe period shall be of sufficient duration to allow the familiarity and self-interest threats to be\naddressed. In the case of a public interest entity, paragraphs R540.5 to R540.21 also apply.\nAudit Clients that are Public Interest Entities\nR540.5\n\nSubject to paragraphs R540.7 to R540.9, in respect of an audit of a public interest entity, an\nindividual shall not act in any of the following roles, or a combination of such roles, for a period\nof more than seven cumulative years (the “time-on” period):\n(a)\n\nThe engagement partner;\n\n(b)\n\nThe individual appointed as responsible for performing the engagement quality review; or\n\n(c)\n\nAny other key audit partner role.\n\nAfter the time-on period, the individual shall serve a “cooling-off” period in accordance with the\nprovisions in paragraphs R540.11 to R540.19.\nR540.6\n\nIn calculating the time-on period, the count of years shall not be restarted unless the individual\nceases to act in any one of the roles in paragraph R540.5(a) to (c) for a minimum period. This\nminimum period is a consecutive period equal to at least the cooling-off period determined in\naccordance with paragraphs R540.11 to R540.13 as applicable to the role in which the individual\nserved in the year immediately before ceasing such involvement.\n\n540.6 A1\n\nFor example, an individual who served as engagement partner for four years followed by three\nyears off can only act thereafter as a key audit partner on the same audit engagement for three\nfurther years (making a total of seven cumulative years). Thereafter, that individual is required to\ncool off in accordance with paragraph R540.15.\n\nR540.7\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R540.5, key audit partners whose continuity is especially important\nto audit quality may, in rare cases due to unforeseen circumstances outside the firm’s control,\nand with the concurrence of those charged with governance, be permitted to serve an additional\nyear as a key audit partner as long as the threat to independence can be eliminated or reduced\nto an acceptable level.\n\n540.7 A1\n\nFor example, a key audit partner may remain in that role on the audit team for up to one additional\nyear in circumstances where, due to unforeseen events, a required rotation was not possible, as\nmight be the case due to serious illness of the intended engagement partner. In such\ncircumstances, this will involve the firm discussing with those charged with governance the\nreasons why the planned rotation cannot take place and the need for any safeguards to reduce\nany threat created.\n\nR540.8\n\nIf an audit client becomes a public interest entity, a firm shall take into account the length of time\nSECTION 540 Page 146 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nan individual has served the audit client as a key audit partner before the client becomes a public\ninterest entity in determining the timing of the rotation. If the individual has served the audit client\nas a key audit partner for a period of five cumulative years or less when the client becomes a\npublic interest entity, the number of years the individual may continue to serve the client in that\ncapacity before rotating off the engagement is seven years less the number of years already\nserved. As an exception to paragraph R540.5, if the individual has served the audit client as a\nkey audit partner for a period of six or more cumulative years when the client becomes a public\ninterest entity, the individual may continue to serve in that capacity with the concurrence of those\ncharged with governance for a maximum of two additional years before rotating off the\nengagement.\nR540.9\n\nWhen a firm has only a few people with the necessary knowledge and experience to serve as a\nkey audit partner on the audit of a public interest entity, rotation of key audit partners might not\nbe possible. As an exception to paragraph R540.5, if an independent regulatory body in the\nrelevant jurisdiction has provided an exemption from partner rotation in such circumstances, an\nindividual may remain a key audit partner for more than seven years, in accordance with such\nexemption. This is provided that the independent regulatory body has specified other\nrequirements which are to be applied, such as the length of time that the key audit partner may\nbe exempted from rotation or a regular independent external review.\n\nOther Considerations Relating to the Time-on Period\nR540.10\n\nIn evaluating the threats created by an individual’s long association with an audit engagement, a\nfirm shall give particular consideration to the roles undertaken and the length of an individual’s\nassociation with the audit engagement prior to the individual becoming a key audit partner.\n\n540.10 A1\n\nThere might be situations where the firm, in applying the conceptual framework, concludes that\nit is not appropriate for an individual who is a key audit partner to continue in that role even\nthough the length of time served as a key audit partner is less than seven years.\n\nCooling-off Period\nR540.11\n\nIf the individual acted as the engagement partner for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off\nperiod shall be five consecutive years.\n\nR540.12\n\nWhere the individual has been appointed as responsible for the engagement quality review and\nhas acted in that capacity for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be three\nconsecutive years.\n\nR540.13\n\nIf the individual has acted as a key audit partner other than in the capacities set out in paragraphs\nR540.11 and R540.12 for seven cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be two consecutive\nyears.\n\n540.14 A1\n\nThe partner rotation requirements in this section are distinct from, and do not modify, the coolingoff period required by ISQM 2 as a condition for eligibility before the engagement partner can\nassume the role of engagement quality reviewer (see paragraph 325.8 A4).\n\nService in a combination of key audit partner roles\nR540.15\n\nIf the individual acted in a combination of key audit partner roles and served as the engagement\npartner for four or more cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be five consecutive years.\n\nR540.16\n\nSubject to paragraph R540.17(a), if the individual acted in a combination of key audit partner\nroles and served as the key audit partner responsible for the engagement quality review for four\nor more cumulative years, the cooling-off period shall be three consecutive years.\n\nR540.17\n\nIf an individual has acted in a combination of engagement partner and engagement quality\nreviewer roles for four or more cumulative years during the time-on period, the cooling-off period\nshall:\n\nR540.18\n\n(a)\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R540.16, be five consecutive years where the individual has\nbeen the engagement partner for three or more years; or\n\n(b)\n\nBe three consecutive years in the case of any other combination.\n\nIf the individual acted in any combination of key audit partner roles other than those addressed\nin paragraphs R540.15 to R540.17, the cooling-off period shall be two consecutive years.\n\nSECTION 540 Page 147 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nService at a Prior Firm\nR540.19\n\nIn determining the number of years that an individual has been a key audit partner as set out in\nparagraph R540.5, the length of the relationship shall, where relevant, include time while the\nindividual was a key audit partner on that engagement at a prior firm.\n\n[Paragraphs 540.20 is intentionally left blank]\nRestrictions on Activities During the Cooling-off Period\nR540.21\n\n540.21 A1\n\nFor the duration of the relevant cooling-off period, the individual shall not:\n(a)\n\nBe an engagement team member or perform an engagement quality review, or a review\nconsistent with the objective of an engagement quality review for the audit engagement;\n\n(b)\n\nConsult with the engagement team or the client regarding technical or industry-specific\nissues, transactions or events affecting the audit engagement (other than discussions with\nthe engagement team limited to work undertaken or conclusions reached in the last year\nof the individual’s time-on period where this remains relevant to the audit);\n\n(c)\n\nBe responsible for leading or coordinating the professional services provided by the firm\nor a network firm to the audit client, or overseeing the relationship of the firm or a network\nfirm with the audit client; or\n\n(d)\n\nUndertake any other role or activity not referred to above with respect to the audit client,\nincluding the provision of non-assurance services, that would result in the individual:\n(i)\n\nHaving significant or frequent interaction with senior management or those charged\nwith governance; or\n\n(ii)\n\nExerting direct influence on the outcome of the audit engagement.\n\nThe provisions of paragraph R540.21 are not intended to prevent the individual from assuming\na leadership role in the firm or a network firm, such as that of the Senior or Managing Partner\n(Chief Executive or equivalent).\n\nSECTION 540 Page 148 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 600\nPROVISION OF NON-ASSURANCE SERVICES TO AN AUDIT CLIENT\nIntroduction\n600.1\n\nFirms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent, and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to\nindependence.\n\n600.2\n\nFirms and network firms might provide a range of non-assurance services to their audit clients,\nconsistent with their skills and expertise. Providing non-assurance services to audit clients might\ncreate threats to compliance with the fundamental principles and threats to independence.\n\n600.3\n\nThis section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual\nframework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence when providing nonassurance services to audit clients. The subsections that follow set out specific requirements and\napplication material that are relevant when a firm or a network firm provides certain types of nonassurance services to audit clients and indicate the types of threats that might be created as a\nresult.\n\n600.4\n\nSome subsections include requirements that expressly prohibit a firm or a network firm from\nproviding certain services to an audit client because the threats created cannot be eliminated\nand safeguards are not capable of being applied to reduce the threats to an acceptable level.\n\n600.5\n\nNew business practices, the evolution of financial markets and changes in technology are some\ndevelopments that make it impossible to draw up an all-inclusive list of non-assurance services\nthat firms and network firms might provide to an audit client. The conceptual framework and the\ngeneral provisions in this section apply when a firm proposes to a client to provide a nonassurance service for which there are no specific requirements and application material.\n\n600.6\n\nThe requirements and application material in this section apply where a firm or a network firm:\n(a)\n\nUses technology to provide a non-assurance service to an audit client; or\n\n(b)\n\nProvides, sells, resells or licenses technology resulting in the provision of a non-assurance\nservice by the firm or a network firm:\n(i)\n\nTo an audit client; or\n\n(ii)\n\nTo an entity that provides services using such technology to audit clients of the firm\nor network firm.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nNon-Assurance Services Provisions in Laws or Regulations\n600.7 A1\n\nParagraphs R100.6 to 100.7 A1 set out requirements and application material relating to\ncompliance with the Code. If there are laws and regulations in a jurisdiction relating to the\nprovision of non-assurance services to audit clients that differ from or go beyond those set out in\nthis section, firms providing non-assurance services to which such provisions apply need to be\naware of those differences and comply with the more stringent provisions.\n\nRisk of Assuming Management Responsibilities when Providing a Non-Assurance Service\n600.8 A1\n\nWhen a firm or a network firm provides a non-assurance service to an audit client, there is a risk\nthat the firm or network firm will assume a management responsibility unless the firm or network\nfirm is satisfied that the requirements in paragraph R400.21 have been complied with.\n\nAccepting an Engagement to Provide a Non-Assurance Service\nR600.9\n\nBefore a firm or a network firm accepts an engagement to provide a non-assurance service to\nan audit client, the firm shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address\nany threat to independence that might be created by providing that service.\n\nSECTION 600 Page 149 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nIdentifying and Evaluating Threats\nAll Audit Clients\n600.10 A1\n\nA description of the categories of threats that might arise when a firm or a network firm provides\na non-assurance service to an audit client is set out in paragraph 120.6 A3.\n\n600.10 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in identifying the different threats that might be created by providing a\nnon-assurance service to an audit client, and evaluating the level of such threats include:\n•\n\nThe nature, scope, intended use and purpose of the service.\n\n•\n\nThe manner in which the service will be provided, such as the personnel to be involved\nand their location.\n\n•\n\nThe client’s dependency on the service, including the frequency with which the service will\nbe provided.\n\n•\n\nThe legal and regulatory environment in which the service is provided.\n\n•\n\nWhether the client is a public interest entity.\n\n•\n\nThe level of expertise of the client’s management and employees with respect to the type\nof service provided.\n\n•\n\nThe extent to which the client determines significant matters of judgement. (Ref: Para.\nR400.20 to R400.21).\n\n•\n\nWhether the outcome of the service will affect the accounting records or matters reflected\nin the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion, and, if so:\n\n•\n\n600.10 A3\n\no\n\nThe extent to which the outcome of the service will have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\no\n\nThe degree of subjectivity involved in determining the appropriate amounts or\ntreatment for those matters reflected in the financial statements.\n\nThe nature and extent of the impact of the service, if any, on the systems that generate\ninformation that forms a significant part of the client’s:\no\n\nAccounting records or financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion.\n\no\n\nInternal controls over financial reporting.\n\n•\n\nThe degree of reliance that will be placed on the outcome of the service as part of the\naudit.\n\n•\n\nThe fee relating to the provision of the non-assurance service.\n\nSubsections 601 to 610 include examples of additional factors that are relevant in identifying\nthreats to independence created by providing certain non-assurance services and evaluating the\nlevel of such threats.\n\nMateriality in relation to financial statements\n600.11 A1\n\nMateriality is a factor that is relevant in evaluating threats created by providing a non- assurance\nservice to an audit client. Subsections 601 to 610 refer to materiality in relation to an audit client’s\nfinancial statements. The concept of materiality in relation to an audit is addressed in ISA 320,\nMateriality in Planning and Performing an Audit, and in relation to a review in ISRE 2400\n(Revised), Engagements to Review Historical Financial Statements. The determination of\nmateriality involves the exercise of professional judgement and is impacted by both quantitative\nand qualitative factors. It is also affected by perceptions of the financial information needs of\nusers.\n\n600.11 A2\n\nWhere the Code expressly prohibits the provision of a non-assurance service to an audit client,\na firm or a network firm is not permitted to provide that service, regardless of the materiality of\nthe outcome or results of the non-assurance service on the financial statements on which the\nfirm will express an opinion.\n\nProviding advice and recommendations\n600.12 A1\n\nProviding advice and recommendations might create a self-review threat. Whether providing\nadvice and recommendations creates a self-review threat involves making the determination set\nSECTION 600 Page 150 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nout in paragraph R600.15. Where the audit client is not a public interest entity and a self- review\nthreat is identified, the firm is required to apply the conceptual framework to evaluate and address\nthe threat. If the audit client is a public interest entity, paragraphs R600.17 and R600.18 apply.\nMultiple non-assurance services provided to the same audit client\nR600.13\n\nWhen a firm or a network firm provides multiple non-assurance services to an audit client, the\nfirm shall consider whether, in addition to the threats created by each service individually, the\ncombined effect of such services creates or impacts threats to independence.\n\n600.13 A1\n\nIn addition to paragraph 600.10 A2, factors that are relevant in a firm’s evaluation of the level of\nthreats to independence created where multiple non-assurance services are provided to an audit\nclient might include whether:\n•\n\nThe combined effect of providing multiple services increases the level of threat created by\neach service assessed individually.\n\n•\n\nThe combined effect of providing multiple services increases the level of any threat arising\nfrom the overall relationship with the audit client.\n\nSelf-review threats\n600.14 A1\n\nWhen a firm or a network firm provides a non-assurance service to an audit client, there might\nbe a risk of the firm auditing its own or the network firm’s work, thereby giving rise to a selfreview threat. A self-review threat is the threat that a firm or a network firm will not appropriately\nevaluate the results of a previous judgement made or an activity performed by an individual within\nthe firm or network firm as part of a non-assurance service on which the audit team will rely when\nforming a judgement as part of an audit.\n\nR600.15\n\nBefore providing a non-assurance service to an audit client, a firm or a network firm shall\ndetermine whether the provision of that service might create a self-review threat by evaluating\nwhether there is a risk that:\n(a)\n\nThe results of the service will form part of or affect the accounting records, the internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, or the financial statements on which the firm will express\nan opinion; and\n\n(b)\n\nIn the course of the audit of those financial statements on which the firm will express an\nopinion, the audit team will evaluate or rely on any judgements made or activities\nperformed by the firm or network firm when providing the service.\n\nAudit Clients that are Public Interest Entities\n600.16 A1\n\nWhen the audit client is a public interest entity, stakeholders have heightened expectations\nregarding the firm’s independence. These heightened expectations are relevant to the\nreasonable and informed third party test used to evaluate a self-review threat created by\nproviding a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity.\n\n600.16 A2\n\nWhere the provision of a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a public interest entity\ncreates a self-review threat, that threat cannot be eliminated, and safeguards are not capable of\nbeing applied to reduce that threat to an acceptable level.\n\nSelf-review threats\nR600.17\n\nA firm or a network firm shall not provide a non-assurance service to an audit client that is a\npublic interest entity if the provision of that service might create a self-review threat in relation to\nthe audit of the financial statements on which the firm will express an opinion. (Ref: Para. 600.14\nA1 and R600.15).\n\nProviding advice and recommendations\nR600.18\n\nAs an exception to paragraph R600.17, a firm or a network firm may provide advice and\nrecommendations to an audit client that is a public interest entity in relation to information or\nmatters arising in the course of an audit provided that the firm:\n(a)\n\nDoes not assume a management responsibility (Ref: Para. R400.20 and R400.21); and\n\n(b)\n\nApplies the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address threats, other than selfreview threats, to independence that might be created by the provision of that advice.\n\nSECTION 600 Page 151 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n600.18 A1\n\nExamples of advice and recommendations that might be provided in relation to information or\nmatters arising in the course of an audit include:\n•\n\nAdvising on accounting and financial reporting standards or policies and financial\nstatement disclosure requirements.\n\n•\n\nAdvising on the appropriateness of financial and accounting control and the methods used\nin determining the stated amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n•\n\nProposing adjusting journal entries arising from audit findings.\n\n•\n\nDiscussing findings on internal controls over financial reporting and processes and\nrecommending improvements.\n\n•\n\nDiscussing how to resolve account reconciliation problems.\n\n•\n\nAdvising on compliance with group accounting policies.\n\nAddressing Threats\nAll Audit Clients\n600.19 A1\n\nParagraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 include a requirement and application material that are\nrelevant when addressing threats to independence, including a description of safeguards.\n\n600.19 A2\n\nThreats to independence created by providing a non-assurance service or multiple services to\nan audit client vary depending on the facts and circumstances of the audit engagement and the\nnature of the service.

In this section, an engagement to issue a restricted use and\ndistribution report in the circumstances set out in paragraph R800.3 is referred to as an “eligible\naudit engagement.”\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR800.3\n\nWhen a firm intends to issue a report on an audit of special purpose financial statements which\nincludes a restriction on use and distribution, the independence requirements set out in Part 4A\nshall be eligible for the modifications that are permitted by this section, but only if:\n(a)\n\nThe firm communicates with the intended users of the report regarding the modified\nindependence requirements that are to be applied in providing the service; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe intended users of the report understand the purpose and limitations of the report and\nexplicitly agree to the application of the modifications.\n\n800.3 A1\n\nThe intended users of the report might obtain an understanding of the purpose and limitations of\nthe report by participating, either directly, or indirectly through a representative who has authority\nto act for the intended users, in establishing the nature and scope of the engagement. In either\ncase, this participation helps the firm to communicate with intended users about independence\nmatters, including the circumstances that are relevant to applying the conceptual framework. It\nalso allows the firm to obtain the agreement of the intended users to the modified independence\nrequirements.\n\nR800.4\n\nWhere the intended users are a class of users who are not specifically identifiable by name at\nthe time the engagement terms are established, the firm shall subsequently make such users\naware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by their representative.\n\n800.4 A1\n\nFor example, where the intended users are a class of users such as lenders in a syndicated loan\narrangement, the firm might describe the modified independence requirements in an engagement\nletter to the representative of the lenders. The representative might then make the firm’s\nengagement letter available to the members of the group of lenders to meet the requirement for\nthe firm to make such users aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by the\nrepresentative.\n\nR800.5\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, any modifications to Part 4A shall be limited\nto those set out in paragraphs R800.7 to R800.14. The firm shall not apply these modifications\nwhen an audit of financial statements is required by law or regulation.\n\nR800.6\n\nIf the firm also issues an audit report that does not include a restriction on use and distribution\nfor the same client, the firm shall apply Part 4A to that audit engagement.\n\nPublic Interest Entities\nR800.7\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, the firm does not need to apply the\nindependence requirements set out in Part 4A that apply only to public interest entity audit\nengagements.\n\nRelated Entities\nR800.8\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible audit engagement, references to “audit client” in Part 4A do\nnot need to include its related entities.

Examples of such engagements include:\n•\n\nAssurance on an entity’s key performance indicators.\n\n•\n\nAssurance on an entity’s compliance with law or regulation.\n\n•\n\nAssurance on performance criteria, such as value for money, achieved by a public sector\nbody.\n\n•\n\nAssurance on the effectiveness of an entity’s system of internal control.\n\n•\n\nAssurance on an entity’s non-financial information, for example, environmental, social and\ngovernance disclosures, including greenhouse gas statements.\n\n•\n\nAn audit of specific elements, accounts or items of a financial statement.\n\n900.2\n\nIn this Part, the term “professional accountant” refers to individual professional accountants in\npublic practice and their firms.\n\n900.3\n\nISQM 1 requires a firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management for\nassurance engagements performed by the firm. As part of this system of quality management,\nISQM 1 requires the firm to establish quality objectives that address the fulfilment of\nresponsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements, including those related to\nindependence. Under ISQM 1, relevant ethical requirements are those related to the firm, its\npersonnel and, when applicable, others subject to the independence requirements to which the\nfirm and the firm’s engagements are subject. In addition, ISAEs and ISAs establish\nresponsibilities for engagement partners and engagement teams at the level of the engagement.\nThe allocation of responsibilities within a firm will depend on its size, structure and organisation.\nMany of the provisions of Part 4B do not prescribe the specific responsibility of individuals within\nthe firm for actions related to independence, instead referring to “firm” for ease of reference. A\nfirm assigns operational responsibility for compliance with independence requirements to an\nindividual(s) in accordance with ISQM 1. Additionally, an individual professional accountant\nremains responsible for compliance with any provisions that apply to that accountant’s activities,\ninterests or relationships.\n\n900.4\n\nIndependence is linked to the principles of objectivity and integrity. It comprises:\n(a)\n\nIndependence of mind – the state of mind that permits the expression of a conclusion\nwithout being affected by influences that compromise professional judgement, thereby\nallowing an individual to act with integrity, and exercise objectivity and professional\nscepticism.\n\n(b)\n\nIndependence in appearance – the avoidance of facts and circumstances that are so\nsignificant that a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a\nfirm’s or an assurance team member’s integrity, objectivity or professional scepticism has\nbeen compromised.\n\nIn this Part, references to an individual or firm being “independent” mean that the individual or firm\nhas complied with the provisions of this Part.\n900.5\n\nWhen performing assurance engagements, the Code requires firms to comply with the\nfundamental principles and be independent. This Part sets out specific requirements and\napplication material on how to apply the conceptual framework to maintain independence when\nperforming assurance engagements other than audit or review engagements. The conceptual\nframework set out in Section 120 applies to independence as it does to the fundamental\nprinciples set out in Section 110.\nSECTION 900 Page 179 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n900.6\n\nThis Part describes:\n(a)\n\nFacts and circumstances, including professional activities, interests and relationships, that\ncreate or might create threats to independence;\n\n(b)\n\nPotential actions, including safeguards, that might be appropriate to address any such\nthreats; and\n\n(c)\n\nSome situations where the threats cannot be eliminated or there can be no safeguards to\nreduce the threats to an acceptable level.\n\nDescription of Assurance Engagements\n900.7\n\nIn an assurance engagement, the firm aims to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in order to\nexpress a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other\nthan the responsible party about the subject matter information. ISAE 3000 (Revised) describes\nthe elements and objectives of an assurance engagement conducted under that Standard, and\nthe Assurance Framework provides a general description of assurance engagements. An\nassurance engagement might either be an attestation engagement or a direct engagement.\n\n900.8\n\nIn this Part, the term ‘assurance engagement’ refers to assurance engagements other than audit\nengagements and review engagements.\n\nReports that Include a Restriction on Use and Distribution\n900.9\n\nAn assurance report might include a restriction on use and distribution. If it does and the\nconditions set out in Section 990 are met, then the independence requirements in this Part may\nbe modified as provided in Section 990.\n\nAudit and Review Engagements\n900.10\n\nIndependence standards for audit and review engagements are set out in Part 4A –\nIndependence for Audit and Review Engagements. If a firm performs both an assurance\nengagement and an audit or review engagement for the same client, the requirements in Part 4A\ncontinue to apply to the firm, a network firm and the audit or review team members.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR900.11\n\nA firm performing an assurance engagement shall be independent of the assurance client.\n\n900.11 A1\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, the assurance client in an assurance engagement is the\nresponsible party and also, in an attestation engagement, the party taking responsibility for the\nsubject matter information (who might be the same as the responsible party).\n\n900.11 A2\n\nThe roles of the parties involved in an assurance engagement might differ and affect the\napplication of the independence provisions in this Part. In the majority of attestation\nengagements, the responsible party and the party taking responsibility for the subject matter\ninformation are the same. This includes those circumstances where the responsible party\ninvolves another party to measure or evaluate the underlying subject matter against the criteria\n(the measurer or evaluator) where the responsible party takes responsibility for the subject matter\ninformation as well as the underlying subject matter. However, the responsible party or the\nengaging party might appoint another party to prepare the subject matter information on the basis\nthat this party is to take responsibility for the subject matter information. In this circumstance, the\nresponsible party and the party responsible for the subject matter information are both assurance\nclients for the purposes of this Part.\n\n900.11 A3\n\nIn addition to the responsible party and, in an attestation engagement, the party taking\nresponsibility for the subject matter information, there might be other parties in relation to the\nengagement. For example, there might be a separate engaging party or a party who is a\nmeasurer or evaluator other than the party taking responsibility for the subject matter information.\nIn these circumstances, applying the conceptual framework requires the professional accountant\nto identify and evaluate threats to the fundamental principles created by any interests or\nrelationships with such parties, including whether any conflicts of interest might exist as described\nin Section 310.\n\nSECTION 900 Page 180 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR900.12\n\nA firm shall apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and\naddress threats to independence in relation to an assurance engagement.\n\nProhibition on Assuming Management Responsibilities\nR900.13\n\nA firm shall not assume a management responsibility related to the underlying subject matter\nand, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of an assurance engagement\nprovided by the firm. If the firm assumes a management responsibility as part of any other service\nprovided to the assurance client, the firm shall ensure that the responsibility is not related to the\nunderlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of\nthe assurance engagement provided by the firm.\n\n900.13 A1\n\nManagement responsibilities involve controlling, leading and directing an entity, including making\ndecisions regarding the acquisition, deployment and control of human, financial, technological,\nphysical and intangible resources.\n\n900.13 A2\n\nWhen a firm assumes a management responsibility related to the underlying subject matter and,\nin an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of an assurance engagement, selfreview, self-interest and familiarity threats are created. Assuming a management responsibility\nmight create an advocacy threat because the firm becomes too closely aligned with the views\nand interests of management.\n\n900.13 A3\n\nDetermining whether an activity is a management responsibility depends on the circumstances\nand requires the exercise of professional judgement. Examples of activities that would be\nconsidered a management responsibility include:\n\n900.13 A4\n\n•\n\nSetting policies and strategic direction.\n\n•\n\nHiring or dismissing employees.\n\n•\n\nDirecting and taking responsibility for the actions of employees in relation to the\nemployees’ work for the entity.\n\n•\n\nAuthorising transactions.\n\n•\n\nControlling or managing bank accounts or investments.\n\n•\n\nDeciding which recommendations of the firm or other third parties to implement.\n\n•\n\nReporting to those charged with governance on behalf of management.\n\n•\n\nTaking responsibility for designing, implementing, monitoring and maintaining internal\ncontrol.\n\nExamples of IT systems services that result in the assumption of a management responsibility in\nrelation to the underlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter\ninformation of an assurance engagement, include where a firm:\n•\n\n•\n\nStores data or manages (directly or indirectly) the hosting of data related to the underlying\nsubject matter or subject matter information. Such services include:\no\n\nActing as the only access to the data or records related to the underlying subject\nmatter or subject matter information.\n\no\n\nTaking custody of or storing the data or records related to the underlying subject\nmatter or subject matter information such that the assurance client’s data or records\nare otherwise incomplete.\n\no\n\nProviding electronic security or back-up services, such as business continuity or a\ndisaster recovery function, for the assurance client’s data or records related to the\nunderlying subject matter or subject matter information.\n\nOperates, maintains, or monitors an assurance client’s IT systems, network or website\nrelated to the underlying subject matter or subject matter information.\n\n900.13 A5\n\nThe collection, receipt, transmission and retention of data provided by an assurance client in the\ncourse of an assurance engagement or to enable the provision of a permissible non-assurance\nservice to the assurance client does not result in an assumption of management responsibility.\n\n900.13 A6\n\nSubject to compliance with paragraph R900.14, providing advice and recommendations to assist\nthe management of an assurance client in discharging its responsibilities is not assuming a\nmanagement responsibility.\nSECTION 900 Page 181 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR900.14\n\nWhen performing a professional activity for an assurance client that is related to the underlying\nsubject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter information of the assurance\nengagement, the firm shall be satisfied that client management makes all related judgements\nand decisions that are the proper responsibility of management. This includes ensuring that the\nclient’s management:\n(a)\n\nDesignates an individual who possesses suitable skill, knowledge and experience to be\nresponsible at all times for the client’s decisions and to oversee the activities. Such an\nindividual, preferably within senior management, would understand:\n(i)\n\nThe objectives, nature and results of the activities; and\n\n(ii)\n\nThe respective client and firm responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the individual is not required to possess the expertise to perform or re-perform\nthe activities.\n\n900.14 A1\n\n(b)\n\nProvides oversight of the activities and evaluates the adequacy of the results of the activity\nperformed for the client’s purpose; and\n\n(c)\n\nAccepts responsibility for the actions, if any, to be taken arising from the results of the\nactivities.\n\nWhen technology is used in performing a professional activity for an assurance client, the\nrequirements in paragraphs R900.13 and R900.14 apply regardless of the nature or extent of\nsuch use of the technology.\n\nMultiple Responsible Parties and Parties Taking Responsibility for the Subject Matter Information\n900.15 A1\n\nIn some assurance engagements, whether an attestation engagement or direct engagement,\nthere might be several responsible parties or, in an attestation engagement, several parties taking\nresponsibility for the subject matter information. In determining whether it is necessary to apply\nthe provisions in this Part to each individual responsible party or each individual party taking\nresponsibility for the subject matter information in such engagements, the firm may take into\naccount certain matters. These matters include whether an interest or relationship between the\nfirm, or an assurance team member, and a particular responsible party or party taking\nresponsibility for the subject matter information would create a threat to independence that is not\ntrivial and inconsequential in the context of the subject matter information. This determination will\ntake into account factors such as:\n(a)\n\nThe materiality of the underlying subject matter or subject matter information for which the\nparticular party is responsible in the context of the overall assurance engagement.\n\n(b)\n\nThe degree of public interest associated with the assurance engagement.\n\nIf the firm determines that the threat created by any such interest or relationship with a particular\nparty would be trivial and inconsequential, it might not be necessary to apply all of the provisions\nof this section to that party.\nNetwork Firms\nR900.16\n\nWhen a firm knows or has reason to believe that interests and relationships of a network firm\ncreate a threat to the firm’s independence, the firm shall evaluate and address any such threat.\n\n900.16 A1\n\nNetwork firms are discussed in paragraphs 400.50 A1 to 400.54 A1.\n\nRelated Entities\nR900.17\n\nWhen the assurance team knows or has reason to believe that a relationship or circumstance\ninvolving a related entity of the assurance client is relevant to the evaluation of the firm’s\nindependence from the client, the assurance team shall include that related entity when\nidentifying, evaluating and addressing threats to independence.\n\n[Paragraphs 900.18 to 900.29 are intentionally left blank]\n\nSECTION 900 Page 182 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPeriod During which Independence is Required\nR900.30\n\nIndependence, as required by this Part, shall be maintained during both:\n(a)\n\nThe engagement period; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe period covered by the subject matter information.\n\n900.30 A1\n\nThe engagement period starts when the engagement team begins to perform assurance services\nwith respect to the particular engagement. The engagement period ends when the assurance\nreport is issued. When the engagement is of a recurring nature, it ends at the later of the\nnotification by either party that the professional relationship has ended or the issuance of the\nfinal assurance report.\n\nR900.31\n\nIf an entity becomes an assurance client during or after the period covered by the subject matter\ninformation on which the firm will express a conclusion, the firm shall determine whether any\nthreats to independence are created by:\n(a)\n\nFinancial or business relationships with the assurance client during or after the period\ncovered by the subject matter information but before accepting the assurance\nengagement; or\n\n(b)\n\nPrevious services provided to the assurance client.\n\nR900.32\n\nThreats to independence are created if a non-assurance service was provided to the assurance\nclient during, or after the period covered by the subject matter information, but before the\nengagement team begins to perform assurance services, and the service would not be permitted\nduring the engagement period. In such circumstances, the firm shall evaluate and address any\nthreat to independence created by the service. If the threats are not at an acceptable level, the\nfirm shall only accept the assurance engagement if the threats are reduced to an acceptable\nlevel.\n\n900.32 A1\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:\n\nR900.33\n\n•\n\nUsing professionals who are not assurance team members to perform the service.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer review the assurance or non-assurance work as\nappropriate.\n\nIf a non-assurance service that would not be permitted during the engagement period has not\nbeen completed and it is not practical to complete or end the service before the commencement\nof professional services in connection with the assurance engagement, the firm shall only accept\nthe assurance engagement if:\n(a)\n\nThe firm is satisfied that:\n(i)\n\nThe non-assurance service will be completed within a short period of time; or\n\n(ii)\n\nThe client has arrangements in place to transition the service to another provider\nwithin a short period of time;\n\n(b)\n\nThe firm applies safeguards when necessary during the service period; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe firm discusses the matter with the party engaging the firm or those charged with\ngovernance of the assurance client.\n\nCommunication with Those Charged with Governance\n900.34 A1\n\nParagraphs R300.9 to 300.9 A2 set out requirements and application material that is relevant to\ncommunications with a party engaging the firm or those charged with governance of the\nassurance client.\n\n900.34 A2\n\nCommunication with a party engaging the firm or those charged with governance of the\nassurance client might be appropriate when significant judgements are made, and conclusions\nreached, to address threats to independence in relation to an assurance engagement because\nthe subject matter information of that engagement is the outcome of a previously performed nonassurance service.\n\n[Paragraphs 900.35 to 900.39 are intentionally left blank]\n\nSECTION 900 Page 183 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nGeneral Documentation of Independence for Assurance Engagements\nR900.40\n\n900.40 A1\n\nA firm shall document conclusions regarding compliance with this Part, and the substance of any\nrelevant discussions that support those conclusions. In particular:\n(a)\n\nWhen safeguards are applied to address a threat, the firm shall document the nature of\nthe threat and the safeguards in place or applied; and\n\n(b)\n\nWhen a threat required significant analysis and the firm concluded that the threat was\nalready at an acceptable level, the firm shall document the nature of the threat and the\nrationale for the conclusion.\n\nDocumentation provides evidence of the firm’s judgements in forming conclusions regarding\ncompliance with this Part. However, a lack of documentation does not determine whether a firm\nconsidered a particular matter or whether the firm is independent.\n\n[Paragraphs 900.41 to 900.49 are intentionally left blank]\nBreach of an Independence Provision for Assurance Engagements\nWhen a Firm Identifies a Breach\nR900.50\n\nIf a firm concludes that a breach of a requirement in this Part has occurred, the firm shall:\n(a)\n\nEnd, suspend or eliminate the interest or relationship that created the breach;\n\n(b)\n\nEvaluate the significance of the breach and its impact on the firm’s objectivity and ability\nto issue an assurance report; and\n\n(c)\n\nDetermine whether action can be taken that satisfactorily addresses the consequences of\nthe breach.\n\nIn making this determination, the firm shall exercise professional judgement and take into\naccount whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that the firm’s\nobjectivity would be compromised, and therefore, the firm would be unable to issue an assurance\nreport.\nR900.51\n\nIf the firm determines that action cannot be taken to address the consequences of the breach\nsatisfactorily, the firm shall, as soon as possible, inform the party that engaged the firm or those\ncharged with governance, as appropriate. The firm shall also take the steps necessary to end\nthe assurance engagement in compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements\nrelevant to ending the assurance engagement.\n\nR900.52\n\nIf the firm determines that action can be taken to address the consequences of the breach\nsatisfactorily, the firm shall discuss the breach and the action it has taken or proposes to take\nwith the party that engaged the firm or those charged with governance, as appropriate. The firm\nshall discuss the breach and the proposed action on a timely basis, taking into account the\ncircumstances of the engagement and the breach.\n\nR900.53\n\nIf the party that engaged the firm does not, or those charged with governance do not concur that\nthe action proposed by the firm in accordance with paragraph R900.50(c) satisfactorily addresses\nthe consequences of the breach, the firm shall take the steps necessary to end the assurance\nengagement in compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements relevant to\nending the assurance engagement.\n\nDocumentation\nR900.54\n\nR900.55\n\nIn complying with the requirements in paragraphs R900.50 to R900.53, the firm shall document:\n(a)\n\nThe breach;\n\n(b)\n\nThe actions taken;\n\n(c)\n\nThe key decisions made; and\n\n(d)\n\nAll the matters discussed with the party that engaged the firm or those charged with\ngovernance.\n\nIf the firm continues with the assurance engagement, it shall document:\n(a)\n\nThe conclusion that, in the firm’s professional judgement, objectivity has not been\ncompromised; and\nSECTION 900 Page 184 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(b)\n\nThe rationale for why the action taken satisfactorily addressed the consequences of the\nbreach so that the firm could issue an assurance report\n\nSECTION 900 Page 185 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 905\nFEES\nIntroduction\n905.1\n\nFirms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to\nindependence.\n\n905.2\n\nFees or other types of remuneration might create a self-interest or intimidation threat. This section\nsets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual\nframework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence arising from fees charged\nto assurance clients.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nFees Paid by an Assurance Client\n905.3 A1\n\nWhen fees are negotiated with and paid by an assurance client, this creates a self-interest threat\nand might create an intimidation threat to independence.\n\n905.3 A2\n\nThe application of the conceptual framework requires that before a firm accepts an assurance\nengagement for an assurance client, the firm determines whether the threats to independence\ncreated by the fees proposed to the client are at an acceptable level. The application of the\nconceptual framework also requires the firm to re-evaluate such threats when facts and\ncircumstances change during the engagement period.\n\n905.3 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of threats created when fees are paid by the\nassurance client include:\n•\n\nThe level of the fees for the assurance engagement and the extent to which they have\nregard to the resources required, taking into account the firm’s commercial and market\npriorities.\n\n•\n\nThe extent of any dependency between the level of the fee for, and the outcome of, the\nservice.\n\n•\n\nThe level of the fee in the context of the service to be provided by the firm or a network\nfirm.\n\n•\n\nThe significance of the client to the firm or partner.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the client.\n\n•\n\nThe nature of the assurance engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe involvement of those charged with governance in agreeing fees.\n\n•\n\nWhether the level of the fee is set by an independent third party, such as a regulatory body.\n\n905.3 A4\n\nThe conditions, policies and procedures described in paragraphs 120.15 A3 (particularly the\nexistence of a quality management system designed and implemented by a firm in accordance\nwith quality management standards issued by the IAASB) might also impact the evaluation of\nwhether the threats to independence are at an acceptable level.\n\n905.3 A5\n\nThe requirements and application material that follow identify circumstances which might need\nto be further evaluated when determining whether the threats are at an acceptable level. For\nthose circumstances, application material includes examples of additional factors that might be\nrelevant in evaluating the threats.\n\nLevel of Fees for Assurance Engagements\n905.4 A1\n\nDetermining the fees to be charged to an assurance client, whether for assurance or other\nservices, is a business decision of the firm taking into account the facts and circumstances\nrelevant to that specific engagement, including the requirements of technical and professional\nstandards.\n\nSECTION 905 Page 186 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n905.4 A2\n\n905.4 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant in evaluating the level of self-interest and intimidation threats created\nby the level of the fee for an assurance engagement when paid by the assurance client include:\n•\n\nThe firm’s commercial rationale for the fee for the assurance engagement.\n\n•\n\nWhether undue pressure has been, or is being, applied by the client to reduce the fee for\nthe assurance engagement.\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who does not take part in the assurance engagement\nassess the reasonableness of the fee proposed, having regard to the scope and complexity\nof the engagement.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who did not take part in the assurance engagement review\nthe work performed.\n\nContingent Fees\n905.5 A1\n\nContingent fees are fees calculated on a predetermined basis relating to the outcome of a\ntransaction or the result of the services performed.

This section sets out requirements and\napplication material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\n940.3 A1\n\nA familiarity threat might be created as a result of an individual’s long association with:\n(a)\n\nThe assurance client;\n\n(b)\n\nThe assurance client’s senior management; or\n\n(c)\n\nThe underlying subject matter or, in an attestation engagement, subject matter information\nof the assurance engagement.\n\n940.3 A2\n\nA self-interest threat might be created as a result of an individual’s concern about losing a\nlongstanding assurance client or an interest in maintaining a close personal relationship with a\nmember of senior management or those charged with governance. Such a threat might influence\nthe individual’s judgement inappropriately.\n\n940.3 A3\n\nFactors that are relevant to evaluating the level of such familiarity or self-interest threats include:\n•\n\nThe nature of the assurance engagement.\n\n•\n\nHow long the individual has been an assurance team member, the individual’s seniority on\nthe team, and the nature of the roles performed, including if such a relationship existed\nwhile the individual was at a prior firm.\n\n•\n\nThe extent to which the work of the individual is directed, reviewed and supervised by more\nsenior personnel.\n\n•\n\nThe extent to which the individual, due to the individual’s seniority, has the ability to\ninfluence the outcome of the assurance engagement, for example, by making key\ndecisions or directing the work of other engagement team members.\n\n•\n\nThe closeness of the individual’s personal relationship with the assurance client or, if\nrelevant, senior management.\n\n•\n\nThe nature, frequency and extent of interaction between the individual and the assurance\nclient.\n\n•\n\nWhether the nature or complexity of the underlying subject matter or subject matter\ninformation has changed.\n\n•\n\nWhether there have been any recent changes in the individual or individuals at the\nassurance client who are responsible for the underlying subject matter or, in an attestation\nengagement, the subject matter information or, if relevant, senior management.\n\n940.3 A4\n\nThe combination of two or more factors might increase or reduce the level of the threats. For\nexample, familiarity threats created over time by the increasingly close relationship between an\nassurance team member and an individual at the assurance client who is in a position to exert\nsignificant influence over the underlying subject matter or, in an attestation engagement, the\nsubject matter information, would be reduced by the departure of that individual from the client.\n\n940.3 A5\n\nAn example of an action that might eliminate the familiarity and self-interest threats in relation to\na specific engagement would be rotating the individual off the assurance team.\n\n940.3 A6\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such familiarity or self-interest threats\ninclude:\n\nSECTION 940 Page 203 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nR940.4\n\n•\n\nChanging the role of the individual on the assurance team or the nature and extent of the\ntasks the individual performs.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not an assurance team member review the work\nof the individual.\n\n•\n\nPerforming regular independent internal or external quality reviews of the engagement.\n\nIf a firm decides that the level of the threats created can only be addressed by rotating the individual\noff the assurance team, the firm shall determine an appropriate period during which the individual\nshall not:\n(a)\n\nBe a member of the engagement team for the assurance engagement;\n\n(b)\n\nPerform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the objective of an\nengagement quality review, for the engagement; or\n\n(c)\n\nExert direct influence on the outcome of the assurance engagement.\n\nThe period shall be of sufficient duration to allow the familiarity and self-interest threats to be\naddressed.\n\nSECTION 940 Page 204 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 950\nPROVISION OF NON-ASSURANCE SERVICES TO ASSURANCE CLIENTS\nIntroduction\n950.1\n\nFirms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent, and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to\nindependence.\n\n950.2\n\nFirms might provide a range of non-assurance services to their assurance clients, consistent with\ntheir skills and expertise. Providing certain non-assurance services to assurance clients might\ncreate threats to compliance with the fundamental principles and threats to independence.\n\n950.3\n\nThis section sets out requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual\nframework to identify, evaluate and address threats to independence when providing nonassurance services to assurance clients.\n\n950.4\n\nNew business practices, the evolution of financial markets and changes in technology are some\ndevelopments that make it impossible to draw up an all-inclusive list of non-assurance services\nthat firms might provide to an assurance client. The conceptual framework and the general\nprovisions in this section apply when a firm proposes to a client to provide a non- assurance\nservice for which there are no specific requirements and application material.\n\n950.5\n\nThe requirements and application material in this section apply where a firm:\n(a)\n\nUses technology to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client; or\n\n(b)\n\nProvides, sells, resells or licenses technology resulting in the provision of a non-assurance\nservice by the firm:\n(i)\n\nTo an assurance client; or\n\n(ii)\n\nTo an entity that provides services using such technology to assurance clients of\nthe firm.\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nRisk of Assuming Management Responsibilities When Providing a Non-Assurance Service\n950.6 A1\n\nWhen a firm provides a non-assurance service to an assurance client, there is a risk that a firm\nwill assume a management responsibility in relation to the underlying subject matter and, in an\nattestation engagement, the subject matter information of the assurance engagement unless the\nfirm is satisfied that the requirements in paragraphs R900.13 and R900.14 have been complied\nwith.\n\nAccepting an Engagement to Provide a Non-Assurance Service\nR950.7\n\nBefore a firm accepts an engagement to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client,\nthe firm shall apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate and address any threat to\nindependence that might be created by providing that service.\n\nIdentifying and Evaluating Threats\n950.8 A1\n\nA description of the categories of threats that might arise when a firm provides a non-assurance\nservice to an assurance client is set out in paragraph 120.6 A3.\n\n950.8 A2\n\nFactors that are relevant in identifying and evaluating the different threats that might be created\nby providing a non-assurance service to an assurance client include:\n•\n\nThe nature, scope, intended use and purpose of the service.\n\n•\n\nThe manner in which the service will be provided, such as the personnel to be involved\nand their location.\n\n•\n\nThe client’s dependency on the service, including the frequency with which the service will\nbe provided.\n\nSECTION 950 Page 205 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n•\n\nThe legal and regulatory environment in which the service is provided.\n\n•\n\nWhether the client is a public interest entity.\n\n•\n\nThe level of expertise of the client’s management and employees with respect to the type\nof service provided.\n\n•\n\nWhether the outcome of the service will affect the underlying subject matter and, in an\nattestation engagement, matters reflected in the subject matter information of the\nassurance engagement, and, if so:\no\n\nThe extent to which the outcome of the service will have a material effect on the\nunderlying subject matter and, in an attestation engagement, the subject matter\ninformation of the assurance engagement.\n\no\n\nThe extent to which the assurance client determines significant matters of judgement\n(Ref: Para. R900.13 to R900.14).\n\n•\n\nThe degree of reliance that will be placed on the outcome of the service as part of the\nassurance engagement.\n\n•\n\nThe fee relating to the provision of the non-assurance service.\n\nMateriality in Relation to an Assurance Client’s Information\n950.9 A1\n\nMateriality is a factor that is relevant in evaluating threats created by providing a non-assurance\nservice to an assurance client. The concept of materiality in relation to an assurance client’s\nsubject matter information is addressed in International Standard on Assurance Engagements\n(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical\nFinancial Information. The determination of materiality involves the exercise of professional\njudgement and is impacted by both quantitative and qualitative factors. It is also affected by\nperceptions of the financial or other information needs of users.\n\nMultiple Non-assurance Services Provided to the Same Assurance Client\n950.10 A1\n\nA firm might provide multiple non-assurance services to an assurance client. In these\ncircumstances the combined effect of threats created by providing those services is relevant to\nthe firm’s evaluation of threats.\n\nSelf-Review Threats\n950.11 A1\n\nA self-review threat might be created if, in an attestation engagement, the firm is involved in the\npreparation of subject matter information which subsequently becomes the subject matter\ninformation of an assurance engagement. Examples of non-assurance services that might create\nsuch self-review threats when providing services related to the subject matter information of an\nassurance engagement include:\n•\n\nDeveloping and preparing prospective information and subsequently issuing an assurance\nreport on this information.\n\n•\n\nPerforming a valuation that is related to or forms part of the subject matter information of an\nassurance engagement.\nDesigning, developing, implementing, operating, maintaining, monitoring, updating or\nupgrading IT systems or IT controls and subsequently undertaking an assurance\nengagement on a statement or report prepared about the IT systems or IT controls.\nDesigning, developing, implementing, operating, maintaining, monitoring, updating or\nupgrading IT systems and subsequently issuing an assurance report on subject matter\ninformation, such as elements of non-financial information, that is prepared from information\ngenerated by such IT systems.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAssurance clients that are public interest entities\n950.12 A1\n\nExpectations about a firm’s independence are heightened when an assurance engagement is\nundertaken by a firm for a public interest entity and the results of that engagement will be:\n(a)\n\nMade available publicly, including to shareholders and other stakeholders; or\n\n(b)\n\nProvided to an entity or organisation established by law or regulation to oversee the\noperation of a business sector or activity.\nSECTION 950 Page 206 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nConsideration of these expectations forms part of the reasonable and informed third party test\napplied when determining whether to provide a non-assurance service to an assurance client.\n950.12 A2\n\nIf a self-review threat exists in relation to an engagement undertaken in the circumstances\ndescribed in paragraph 950.12 A1 (b), the firm is encouraged to disclose the existence of that\nself-review threat and the steps taken to address it to the party engaging the firm or those\ncharged with governance of the assurance client and to the entity or organisation established by\nlaw or regulation to oversee the operation of a business sector or activity to which the results of\nthe engagement will be provided.\n\nAddressing Threats\n950.13 A1\n\nParagraphs R120.10 to 120.10 A2 include a requirement and application material that are\nrelevant when addressing threats to independence, including a description of safeguards.\n\n950.13 A2\n\nThreats to independence created by providing a non-assurance service or multiple services to\nan assurance client vary depending on facts and circumstances of the assurance engagement\nand the nature of the service. Such threats might be addressed by applying safeguards or by\nadjusting the scope of the proposed service.\n\n950.13 A3\n\nExamples of actions that might be safeguards to address such threats include:\n\n950.13 A4\n\n•\n\nUsing professionals who are not assurance team members to perform the service.\n\n•\n\nHaving an appropriate reviewer who was not involved in providing the service review the\nassurance work or service performed.\n\nSafeguards might not be available to reduce the threat created by providing a non-assurance\nservice to an assurance client to an acceptable level. In such a situation, the application of the\nconceptual framework requires the firm to:\n(a)\n\nAdjust the scope of the proposed service to eliminate the circumstances that are creating\nthe threat;\n\n(b)\n\nDecline or end the service that creates the threat that cannot be eliminated or reduced to\nan acceptable level; or\n\n(c)\n\nEnd the assurance engagement.\n\nSECTION 950 Page 207 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nSECTION 990\nREPORTS THAT INCLUDE A RESTRICTION ON USE AND DISTRIBUTION\n(ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENTS OTHER THAN AUDIT AND REVIEW ENGAGEMENTS)\nIntroduction\n990.1\n\nFirms are required to comply with the fundamental principles, be independent and apply the\nconceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats to\nindependence.\n\n990.2\n\nThis section sets out certain modifications to Part 4B which are permitted in certain\ncircumstances involving assurance engagements where the report includes a restriction on use\nand distribution. In this section, an engagement to issue a restricted use and distribution\nassurance report in the circumstances set out in paragraph R990.3 is referred to as an “eligible\nassurance engagement.”\n\nRequirements and Application Material\nGeneral\nR990.3\n\nWhen a firm intends to issue a report on an assurance engagement which includes a restriction\non use and distribution, the independence requirements set out in Part 4B shall be eligible for\nthe modifications that are permitted by this section, but only if:\n(a)\n\nThe firm communicates with the intended users of the report regarding the modified\nindependence requirements that are to be applied in providing the service; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe intended users of the report understand the purpose, subject matter information and\nlimitations of the report and explicitly agree to the application of the modifications.\n\n990.3 A1\n\nThe intended users of the report might obtain an understanding of the purpose, subject matter\ninformation, and limitations of the report by participating, either directly, or indirectly through a\nrepresentative who has authority to act for the intended users, in establishing the nature and\nscope of the engagement. In either case, this participation helps the firm to communicate with\nintended users about independence matters, including the circumstances that are relevant to\napplying the conceptual framework. It also allows the firm to obtain the agreement of the intended\nusers to the modified independence requirements.\n\nR990.4\n\nWhere the intended users are a class of users who are not specifically identifiable by name at\nthe time the engagement terms are established, the firm shall subsequently make such users\naware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by their representative.\n\n990.4 A1\n\nFor example, where the intended users are a class of users such as lenders in a syndicated loan\narrangement, the firm might describe the modified independence requirements in an engagement\nletter to the representative of the lenders. The representative might then make the firm’s\nengagement letter available to the members of the group of lenders to meet the requirement for\nthe firm to make such users aware of the modified independence requirements agreed to by the\nrepresentative.\n\nR990.5\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement, any modifications to Part 4B shall\nbe limited to those modifications set out in paragraphs R990.7 and R990.8.\n\nR990.6\n\nIf the firm also issues an assurance report that does not include a restriction on use and\ndistribution for the same client, the firm shall apply Part 4B to that assurance engagement.\n\nFinancial Interests, Loans and Guarantees, Close Business, Family and Personal Relationships\nR990.7\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement:\n(a)\n\nThe relevant provisions set out in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924 need apply\nonly to the members of the engagement team, and their immediate and close family\nmembers;\n\n(b)\n\nThe firm shall identify, evaluate and address any threats to independence created by\ninterests and relationships, as set out in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924,\nbetween the assurance client and the following assurance team members;\n(i)\n\nThose who provide consultation regarding technical or industry-specific issues,\ntransactions or events; and\nSECTION 990 Page 208 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\n(ii)\n(c)\n\nThose who perform an engagement quality review, or a review consistent with the\nobjective of an engagement quality review, for the engagement; and\n\nThe firm shall evaluate and address any threats that the engagement team has reason to\nbelieve are created by interests and relationships between the assurance client and others\nwithin the firm who can directly influence the outcome of the assurance engagement, as set\nout in Sections 910, 911, 920, 921, 922 and 924.\n\n990.7 A1\n\nOthers within the firm who can directly influence the outcome of the assurance engagement\ninclude those who recommend the compensation, or who provide direct supervisory,\nmanagement or other oversight, of the assurance engagement partner in connection with the\nperformance of the assurance engagement.\n\nR990.8\n\nWhen the firm performs an eligible assurance engagement, the firm shall not hold a material\ndirect or a material indirect financial interest in the assurance client.\n\nSECTION 990 Page 209 of 226\n\n\fTHE CODE\n\nPART 10 – INSOLVENCY\nPart 10 of the ICAEW Code consists of the Insolvency Code of Ethics.
